# Welcome to the AVATARARTS & QuantumForge Labs Workspace

This workspace has been reorganized to align with a clear, dual-brand strategy. The goal is to move from planning and analysis to focused execution.

## The Two Pillars

This project is now divided into two core pillars, each with a distinct mission and focus.

### 1. `avatararts_creative/` - The Creative Alchemy Studio

This is where code is transmuted into canvas and algorithms into artistry. This brand is focused on the creative application of AI.

- **`/gallery`**: Contains all creative assets, including images for Print-on-Demand, music, and stories.
- **`/foundry`**: The workshop for creative tools. Contains AI art generation scripts, prompt libraries, and other generative tools.
- **`/website`**: Source code and assets for the public-facing AvatarArts.org website, and other documentation-as-website projects.

### 2. `quantumforge_labs/` - The Deep Tech Forge

This is the home of pure R&D, commercial products, and foundational algorithms that power the creative tools.

- **`/products`**: Contains all monetizable scripts, utilities, and SaaS projects. This is where you'll find the Python tools, Upwork automations, and more.
- **`/research`**: For R&D, experimentation with foundational models, and academic-style work.
- **`/business`**: Holds all business-related strategy, including monetization plans, SEO strategy, Upwork materials, and financial documents.

## Supporting Directories

- **`config/`**: A centralized location for all AI and editor configurations (`.gemini`, `.claude`, `.vscode`, etc.). This keeps the root directory clean.
- **`archive/`**: All previous meta-documentation, analysis reports, summaries, and old, unsorted folders have been moved here. This directory is a record of the project's history, but it is intentionally separated to allow for forward momentum.

## Your Path Forward

1.  **Explore the New Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the new locations of your key assets.
2.  **Focus on a Pillar:** Decide whether you want to work on a creative project (`avatararts_creative`) or a tech product (`quantumforge_labs`) and dive into that directory.
3.  **Execute:** The analysis is complete. The structure is set. Now is the time to build, create, and launch.
