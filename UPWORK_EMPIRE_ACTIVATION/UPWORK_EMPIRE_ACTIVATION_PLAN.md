### Template 1: Enterprise AI Automation ($300-1000 projects)

**Subject:** Enterprise AI Pipeline: n8n + Python + Character Consistency System

Hi [Client Name],

I read your requirement for [specific detail from job post] and I've built this exact system twice - once for my SaaS product (Retention Suite) and once for a client in [similar industry].

**What I'll deliver:**
1. **Workflow 1 (Bulk Generation):** Google Sheets → Gemini Nano Banana Pro API → Google Drive sync
   - Character consistency via SoulID/Reference Anchors
   - ~100 images/day capacity (Pro tier limits)

   - Batch rendering with progress tracking

3. **Workflow 3 (QA System):** Automated quality checks
   - Image similarity scoring (detect character drift)
   - Resolution/format validation
   - Duplicate detection

**Technical Stack:**
- n8n (self-hosted or cloud - your preference)
- Python 3.11+ (all scripts documented)
- Google Workspace APIs (Sheets, Drive)
- Nano Banana Pro API (~$0.15 per 4K image)
- FFmpeg for video processing

**Timeline:**

I can have a working prototype (10-image test batch) ready within 48 hours of project start.

My rate for system architecture work is $[45-100/hr] or I can do this as a fixed-price $[500-800] project with defined scope.

Let me know if you'd like to see examples of my character consistency work - I have a portfolio piece demonstrating 50+ images of the same character in different scenarios.

### Template 2: AI Video Production ($45-100/hr)

**Subject:** Cinematic AI Video System: Higgsfield + SoulID + Workflow Automation

Hi [Client Name],

Saw your post about needing [specific video type]. I specialize in the "character consistency" problem that plagues most AI video work - I use Higgsfield Cinema Studio's SoulID technology combined with director-level prompt engineering.

**What makes my work different:**
Most AI video freelancers produce generic "polished" content. I deliver cinematic-quality sequences with:
- Precise camera control (dolly, crane, tracking shots)
- Locked character geometry across shots (SoulID/Character Lock)
- Professional color grading and lighting specs
- Film-accurate motion (24fps, film grain, anamorphic lenses)

**Sample Workflow (for your [specific project type]):**
1. **Shot 1:** Emotional close-up dolly push-in (golden hour lighting)
2. **Shot 2:** Wide establishing crane movement (environmental context)
3. **Shot 3:** Dynamic tracking shot (action/movement)
4. **Post-Processing:** Sora 2 Enhancer for artifact removal + Topaz upscaling

**Technical Details:**
- Higgsfield Cinema Studio (WAN Camera Control presets)
- Character training via reference anchors (5-10 images)
- Start/End frame upload for seamless transitions
- Batch automation via n8n (if needed at scale)

**Timeline:**
- 1-2 days per shot (including iterations)
- Full sequence: [estimate based on their scope]

**Portfolio:**
I have a cinematic reel showing 7 different scenarios (horror, action, fashion editorial, spiritual) - all using the same locked character across different moods and camera angles.

My rate is $[45-100/hr] for video work, or I can quote a per-shot fixed rate if you have a defined shot list.

Happy to do a paid test shot ($[50-150]) if you want to verify quality before committing to the full project.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 3: Bulk Content Generation ($25-50/hr)

**Subject:** High-Volume AI Content Pipeline: 100+ Assets/Day System

Hi [Client Name],

I run a content automation business with 2,300+ managed assets, so I've solved the "bulk generation" problem multiple times. For your [specific need], here's what I'd build:

**System Architecture:**
1. **Input Layer:** Google Sheets with your prompts/variables
2. **Processing Layer:** Python batch processor (one of my 758+ production scripts)
3. **AI Generation:** Nano Banana Pro API (character consistency built-in)
4. **Output Layer:** Auto-sync to Google Drive with organized folders

**Capacity:**
- ~100 images/day (Nano Banana Pro tier limits)
- Can scale to 1,000/day with Ultra tier ($99-124/mo)
- Character consistency: Up to 5 distinct characters tracked

**Quality Controls:**
- Automated similarity scoring (catch character drift)
- Resolution validation (ensure 4K output)
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Error logging and retry logic

**What You Get:**
- Turnkey system (you just update the Google Sheet)
- Complete documentation
- Training video (15-20 min walkthrough)
- 30 days of support for tweaks

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-2: Setup and API integration
- Day 3: Testing with 50-image batch
- Days 4-5: Handoff and training

My rate is $[25-50/hr] for implementation work, estimated [X hours] total. Or I can do fixed-price at $[300-500] depending on complexity.

I have sample output showing 50+ consistent images of the same character - happy to share as proof of capability.

Best,
[Your Name]
