### **Template 1: SEO Educational Post**
```
**Title:** "5 SEO Mistakes Killing Your Medical Practice's Online Visibility"

**Content:**
I've audited 100+ medical practice websites and these are the 5 most common SEO mistakes I see:

❌ **MISTAKE #1: Generic Meta Descriptions**
Most practices use "Welcome to our practice" instead of location-specific, keyword-rich descriptions.

✅ **SOLUTION:** "Leading Gainesville psychiatrist Dr. Smith offers TMS therapy and mental health services. Call (352) 378-9116 for appointments."

❌ **MISTAKE #2: Missing H1 Tags**
Critical for SEO - tells search engines what your page is about.

✅ **SOLUTION:** "Top Psychiatrist Gainesville FL | TMS Therapy & Mental Health Services"

❌ **MISTAKE #3: No Local SEO Optimization**
Missing Google My Business optimization and local citations.

✅ **SOLUTION:** Complete local SEO setup with citations, reviews, and geo-targeting.

❌ **MISTAKE #4: Poor Mobile Experience**
70%+ of medical traffic is mobile - slow, unresponsive sites lose patients.

✅ **SOLUTION:** Mobile-first design with fast loading times.

❌ **MISTAKE #5: No Schema Markup**
Missing structured data that helps search engines understand your content.

✅ **SOLUTION:** MedicalBusiness schema markup for better search visibility.

**RESULT:** One client saw 400% increase in organic traffic after fixing these issues.
