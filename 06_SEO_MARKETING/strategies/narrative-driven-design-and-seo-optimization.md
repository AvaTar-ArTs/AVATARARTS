            "content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user wants me to apply a detailed narrative-driven image generation framework to the existing batches of prompts they provided earlier. They mentioned using the structure from their previous example, which involved creating batches of images with specific purposes like Cover Image, Transition, Main Image, and Filler, each serving a narrative role.\n\n\n\nFirst, I need to recall the original batches they provided. There was Batch 1 with original prompts and variations, and Batch 2 with creative interpretations. Each batch had two images per product, focusing on different aspects like core action, transitions, fillers, and thematic expansions. The user now wants me to integrate the narrative framework more deeply into these batches, ensuring each image adheres to the roles defined in their guide: Cover Image, Transition, Main Image, and Filler, while also proposing new ideas for continuation.\n\n\n\nI need to make sure that each image in the batches aligns with the narrative roles. For example, the first image in each product should be a Cover Image that sets the theme, followed by a Transition image that shifts focus, then a Main Image highlighting the core action or emotion, and a Filler image for emotional depth or context. Additionally, after generating these batches, I should propose four new ideas to expand the narrative, staying within the same thematic world but offering fresh perspectives.\n\n\n\nLooking at the existing Batch 1 for the Retro Gaming Hoodie, the first image is a dynamic close-up, which could be considered the Main Image. The second image, a zoomed-out view with a silhouette figure, serves as a Transition. However, according to the user's framework, the first image should be a Cover Image introducing the theme. Therefore, I might need to adjust the order or redefine the roles of the existing images to fit the narrative structure.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, for the Kawaii Cat Stickers, the first image is a vibrant flatlay (Main Image), and the second is a close-up peeling sticker (Transition/Filler). Again, aligning these with the Cover Image, Transition, Main Image, and Filler structure requires reorganizing or redefining the prompts.\n\n\n\nThe user also wants technical details like aspect ratio (9:16), solid backgrounds, vibrant colors, and isolation of graphics. I need to ensure all prompts adhere to these specifications. Additionally, after each batch of four images, I must propose four new ideas that continue the narrative, exploring underdeveloped parts or new emotional elements.\n\n\n\nPotential challenges include ensuring that each image fulfills its narrative role without deviating from the original product focus. For example, transforming the Retro Gaming Hoodie's existing images into a Cover Image that symbolically represents the product's theme, followed by transitions and fillers that build the story around it. Similarly, for the Kawaii Cat Stickers, the Cover Image needs to encapsulate the essence of kawaii culture, with subsequent images providing transitions and emotional depth.\n\n\n\nI also need to maintain consistency in style and technical specifications across all images, ensuring they are suitable for mydesigns.io's auto-generation, which prefers solid backgrounds and isolated graphics. Each prompt must be descriptive enough for DALL-E 3 to generate the intended visuals while adhering to the narrative roles defined.\n\n\n\nAfter structuring the batches according to the narrative framework, the next step is to propose four new ideas for each product that expand the story. These ideas should offer fresh perspectives, such as exploring secondary characters, symbolic object evolution, flashbacks, or metaphorical landscapes related to the product's theme.\n\n\n\nFinally, I need to present all this in a clear, organized format that aligns with the user's previous examples, using markdown for structure and including key workflows, technical details, and options for further refinements or additional batches.\n\n\n\n🎨 Narrative-Driven Image Batches with Expanded Framework\n\n*Format: 9:16 (1080x1920 px), solid backgrounds, DALL-E 3, optimized for mydesigns.io.*\n\n\n\nBatch 1: Retro Gaming Hoodie (Structured Narrative)\n\n1. Cover Image (Theme Introduction)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A dystopian cityscape where skyscrapers are giant 8-bit arcade cabinets glowing with neon cyan and magenta. A shadowy figure stands at the center wearing the hoodie, its pixelated Pac-Man design radiating light. Graffiti text reads ‘GAME ON’ in retro font. Aspect Ratio: 9:16.\"\n\n\n\n2. Transition (Mood Shift)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"Close-up of the hoodie’s sleeve, where glowing ghosts escape the fabric into the air as pixelated smoke. The background fades into a static-filled grid, with binary ‘LEVEL UP’ text flickering softly. Muted purple lighting.\"\n\n\n\n3. Main Image (Core Action)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"The figure now running through a neon-lit arcade maze, chased by holographic ghosts. The hoodie’s glow intensifies, casting sharp shadows. ‘HIGH SCORE’ flashes on a broken arcade screen in the background. Dynamic cyan lighting.\"\n\n\n\n4. Filler (Emotional Pause)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"The hoodie discarded on a retro joystick, glowing ghosts hovering above it. Dust motes float in amber light from a nearby ‘INSERT COIN’ sign. Warm, nostalgic tones.\"\n\n\n\nBatch 2: Kawaii Cat Stickers (Structured Narrative)\n\n1. Cover Image (Theme Introduction)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A pastel dreamscape with floating sushi planets and ramen nebulas. A giant chibi cat in a chef hat waves from a sticker-shaped rocket. The text ‘Kawaii Universe’ glows in bubblegum pink. Aspect Ratio: 9:16.\"\n\n\n\n2. Transition (Mood Shift)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"Close-up of a sticker peeling off a laptop, revealing holographic glitter beneath. Sakura petals swirl around the edges, transitioning to a lavender gradient. Soft focus, ethereal lighting.\"\n\n\n\n3. Main Image (Core Emotion)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"Flatlay of glittering cat stickers arranging themselves into a sushi feast. One sticker winks, holding a ‘Nyaa~ Delicious!’ speech bubble. Mint-green background with soft drop shadows. Vibrant, playful lighting.\"\n\n\n\n4. Filler (Reflective Pause)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A lone sticker on a teacup, reflecting a surreal kitchen in its surface. Cats cook floating sushi in the reflection, while the real world fades to watercolor. Warm golden hour glow.\"\n\n\n\nFour New Ideas for Continuation (Per Product)\n\nRetro Gaming Hoodie\n\nFlashback Scene: Sunlit 1980s bedroom with a child drawing the hoodie’s design on graph paper.\n\n\n\nSymbolic Evolution: Hoodie now mended with glowing thread, Pac-Man chasing golden ghosts.\n\n\n\nAntagonist Focus: Glitchy red ghost manifesting as a shadowy figure in the arcade.\n\n\n\nMetaphorical Landscape: Hoodie unraveling into a river of pixels flowing through the city.\n\n\n\nKawaii Cat Stickers\n\nSecondary Character: A shy kitten sticker hiding behind a sushi roll, peeking curiously.\n\n\n\nSurreal Expansion: Stickers coming alive at night, hosting a tea party on a moonlit desk.\n\n\n\nConflict Element: A ‘spoiled milk’ sticker causing chaos in the kawaii kitchen.\n\n\n\nTime-Lapse: Sticker fading over time, revealing a hidden message: ‘Adventure Awaits!’\n\n\n\nTechnical Workflow\n\nSolid Backgrounds: All graphics isolated for seamless mydesigns.io integration.\n\n\n\nTypography: Glowing retro fonts for gaming, glitter scripts for kawaii.\n\n\n\nColor Palettes:\n\n\n\nGaming: Neon cyan/magenta vs. dark grays.\n\n\n\nKawaii: Pastel mint/pink with gold accents.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine Concepts: Adjust symbolism or lighting for tonal consistency.\n\n\n\nGenerate Additional Batches: Expand conflict/resolution arcs (e.g., glitch battles for gaming, sticker quests for cats).\n\n\n\nA/B Test Titles: Compare “Retro Revival Hoodie” vs. “Pixel Punk Sweatshirt” for CTR.\n\n\n\nNeed adjustments or deeper narrative exploration? Let’s iterate! 🚀\n\nOkay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want me to generate images in two batches. The first batch includes the original prompt plus a variation, and the second batch is my own interpretation, each batch containing two images. They mentioned using DALL-E 3 and adhering to specific narrative guidelines with a 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\n\n\nFirst, I need to understand their existing setup. They have a system called mydesigns.io for auto-generating mockups, so I don't need to worry about that part. The focus is on creating the actual image prompts based on their provided narrative structure. The user provided detailed guidelines on how to structure the images, including cover images, transitions, main images, fillers, and transitions again. They also want batches of four images, split into two batches of two, totaling four images. Wait, the user mentioned two batches with two images each, but in the guidelines, they mention creating four images. There's a slight contradiction here. Let me clarify.\n\n\n\nThe user says: \"create the images above in a batch create in TWO sets of Batches.. The First=Original Prompt + A variation image || THE SECOND=your own interpretation of the content as just as the first, TWO SEPERATE IMAGES. REMEMBER THE + == A SEPERATE Image SO TWO IMAGES TOTAL PER BATCH.\" So, two batches, each with two images: the first batch has original and variation, the second batch has two interpretations. But the guidelines mention four images per batch. This is confusing. Let me check again.\n\n\n\nWait, in the problem description, the user says: \"ALWAYS create in batches of 4 images. Continue generating batches until all sections of the narrative are visually represented.\" But then they specify that they want two batches, each with two images. There's a conflict here. The user might have made a mistake, but I need to adhere to their latest instruction. The user says: \"create in batches of 4 images. If necessary, create two batches of two images each to ensure a total of four images.\" So, the total should be four images, split into two batches of two each. However, the user's example shows two batches with two images each. Therefore, I'll proceed by creating two batches, each containing two images, totaling four images.\n\n\n\nNext, I need to apply the narrative image generation guide. The user provided a structured approach with cover image, transition, main image, filler, and another transition. Each batch should follow this structure. However, since each batch has two images, I need to condense the structure. Maybe each batch includes a main image and a transition, or a main image and a filler. But the user wants each batch to have an original prompt + variation, and the second batch to have interpretations. Let me focus on the two batches as per the user's instruction.\n\n\n\nFor the first batch: Original Prompt + Variation. So, take the original design prompt and create a variation of it. For example, if the original prompt is a retro gaming hoodie, the variation could be a different angle or added elements.\n\n\n\nFor the second batch: My own interpretation. This means taking the same theme but presenting it in a different visual style or perspective. For example, if the original was a hoodie with Pac-Man, my interpretation could be a scene where the hoodie is worn in a cyberpunk city.\n\n\n\nI need to ensure that all images are in 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920 pixels, isolated on solid backgrounds. Also, follow the narrative flow: cover image, transition, main image, filler, etc., but condensed into two images per batch.\n\n\n\nLet me start by outlining the first batch based on the previous prompts. The user had examples like the Retro Gaming Hoodie and Kawaii Sticker Pack. For each of these, create an original image and a variation.\n\n\n\nThen, for the second batch, create two new images that interpret the same themes differently. For example, instead of the hoodie, show the hoodie in a dynamic scene, or focus on a different aspect of the design.\n\n\n\nI need to structure each batch with two images, following the narrative guidelines. Each image should have a descriptive prompt for DALL-E, adhering to the technical defaults. Also, ensure that the SEO keywords and other metadata are included as per the CSV structure, but since the user is focused on image generation, maybe the CSV part is handled separately.\n\n\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"do not worry about mockups, I have a system that autogenerates called mydesigns.io\", so the focus is purely on the image prompts. The CSV part was from earlier steps but now the user is moving to image generation. Therefore, the task now is to generate the DALL-E prompts for the images as per the batches.\n\n\n\nPutting it all together: For each product example, generate two batches. Each batch has two images. The first batch is original and variation, the second batch is two interpretations. All images follow the narrative structure and technical specs.\n\n\n\nNow, I need to apply this to the examples provided earlier, like the Retro Gaming Hoodie, Sci-Fi Tumbler, etc., and create the image prompts accordingly.\n\n\n\nLet me proceed to draft the image prompts following these guidelines.\n\n\n\nBatch 1: Original Prompt + Variation\n\n*Format: 9:16 (1080x1920 px), solid background, vibrant colors, DALL-E 3.*\n\n\n\n1. Original Prompt: Retro Gaming Hoodie\n\nImage 1: Core Action (Main Image)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A dynamic close-up of a glow-in-the-dark 8-bit pixel art hoodie against a solid black background. The design features Pac-Man chasing neon-blue ghosts through a labyrinthine maze, with ‘GAME OVER’ glowing in retro arcade font. Sparks of electric cyan and magenta highlight the fabric texture.\"\n\n\n\nImage 2: Variation (Transition + Filler)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A zoomed-out view of the same hoodie worn by a silhouette figure standing in a neon-lit arcade hallway. The background transitions into a pixelated grid, with floating ‘LEVEL UP’ text in binary code. Soft purple lighting emphasizes the hoodie’s glow against the dark setting.\"\n\n\n\n2. Original Prompt: Kawaii Cat Stickers\n\nImage 1: Core Emotion (Main Image)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A vibrant flatlay of pastel anime cat stickers on a mint-green background. The chibi cats wear sushi chef hats, rolling glittering maki rolls with speech bubbles saying ‘Nyaa~ Delicious!’ in pink glitter typography. Soft shadows add depth.\"\n\n\n\nImage 2: Variation (Filler + Transition)\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A close-up of a sticker peeling off a laptop, revealing a holographic shimmer effect. The background shifts to a gradient of lavender and gold, with tiny floating sushi emojis and sakura petals. The sticker’s edges glow faintly.\"\n\n\n\nBatch 2: Creative Interpretation\n\nSame technical specs, fresh narrative angles.\n\n\n\n1. Retro Gaming Hoodie (Interpretation)\n\nImage 1: Symbolic Cover Image\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A dystopian cityscape at night, where skyscrapers are replaced by giant 8-bit arcade cabinets. A lone figure wears the hoodie, its pixel art glowing against the rain-soaked streets. Neon signs flicker ‘INSERT COIN’ in the distance.\"\n\n\n\nImage 2: Emotional Filler\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A crumpled hoodie discarded on a retro arcade machine, glowing ghosts escaping its fabric into the air. The machine’s screen reads ‘HIGH SCORE,’ casting a warm amber glow on the scene. Dust particles float in the light.\"\n\n\n\n2. Kawaii Cat Stickers (Interpretation)\n\nImage 1: Narrative Transition\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A cat-shaped sticker rocket blasting off from a desk, trailing rainbow exhaust. The background is a cosmic galaxy of sushi planets and ramen nebulas. The rocket’s window reveals a tiny waving chibi cat.\"\n\n\n\nImage 2: Thematic Expansion\n\nPrompt:\n\n\"A surreal kitchen where cats cook sushi in chef hats, framed by floating sticker edges. The walls melt into watercolor waves, and ingredients levitate in mid-air. A ‘Kawaii Cafe’ sign glows in bubblegum pink.\"\n\n\n\nKey Workflow:\n\n\n\nBatch 1 adheres to the original prompts but adds atmospheric transitions.\n\n\n\nBatch 2 reimagines the themes in narrative-driven, symbolic scenes.\n\n\n\nAll images are optimized for mydesigns.io auto-generation (solid backgrounds, isolated graphics).\n\n\n\nNeed refinements or another batch?

Let me know! 🔍\n\nAlright, the user has provided a detailed JSON file related to image data analysis and optimization. They also included a comprehensive SEO analytics structure and asked to apply that structure to their CSV data. Let me break down their request step by step.\n\n\n\nFirst, the user wants more design prompts for specific niches like geeky, dark humor, and anime. They also want the CSV data structured for bulk upload, incorporating the SEO analytics framework they provided. The challenge here is to merge the SEO structure with the existing product data from the CSV, ensuring that each product entry includes SEO-relevant metrics and strategies.\n\n\n\nI need to start by understanding the SEO framework they provided. It includes sections like keyword performance, organic traffic, conversion rate optimization, backlink authority, and engagement metrics. Each of these sections has specific metrics and visual representations. My task is to map these SEO elements to the product data in the CSV.\n\n\n\nNext, for the design prompts, I should generate creative and niche-specific ideas that align with the products listed. For example, geeky designs could involve tech or gaming themes, dark humor might include sarcastic or edgy graphics, and anime would feature popular characters or styles from that genre.\n\n\n\nThe CSV finalization requires organizing the product data into a structured format that includes columns like Title, Description, Category, Retail Price, Sizes, Template Size, and Design Prompt. Additionally, incorporating SEO metrics means adding sections or columns that reflect keyword rankings, traffic sources, conversion rates, backlink quality, and engagement statistics related to each product.\n\n\n\nOne potential confusion is how to integrate SEO metrics into a product CSV. Typically, SEO data pertains to web content rather than physical products. To resolve this, I might need to interpret the SEO framework metaphorically, applying concepts like keyword performance to product titles and descriptions, conversion rates to product sales performance, and engagement metrics to customer interaction with product pages.\n\n\n\nAnother point is ensuring that the design prompts are not only creative but also optimized for SEO. This means using keywords in the design descriptions that align with what users might search for. For example, a geeky t-shirt design prompt could include terms like \"retro gaming\" or \"cyberpunk,\" which are likely search terms in that niche.\n\n\n\nI also need to maintain consistency in the CSV format, ensuring that all entries follow the same structure and that data types are uniform. This includes standardizing units for price, sizes, and template dimensions. Additionally, the design prompts should be descriptive enough to guide the creation of the product images while incorporating SEO-friendly language.\n\n\n\nFinally, I should review the entire CSV for any errors or inconsistencies, such as missing fields or mismatched data types. Ensuring that the SEO metrics are logically tied to the product entries will make the CSV both functional for bulk upload and informative for marketing strategies.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n\n\n1. Generate niche-specific design prompts that are SEO-optimized.\n\n\n\n2. Structure the CSV to include product details alongside SEO metrics.\n\n\n\n3. Ensure data consistency and accuracy in the CSV.\n\n\n\n4. Metaphorically apply the SEO framework to product entries for enhanced marketability.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, the user will have a comprehensive CSV that not only lists products but also integrates SEO strategies to boost their online visibility and sales performance.\n\n\n\n🎨 Niche-Specific Design Prompts + 📊 SEO-Optimized CSV Finalization\n\nLet’s merge your SEO framework with the product data to create a high-impact CSV for bulk uploads.

Let me look at the existing content to understand the structure and tone.\n\nFirst, the file contains detailed design prompts for products in specific niches (geeky, dark humor, anime), each with SEO keywords and CSV formatting examples. There's a strong emphasis on SEO optimization, technical specifications (like aspect ratios and DALL-E prompts), and narrative-driven image batches. The user also includes sections like \"Key Workflow\" and \"Next Steps\" for actionable guidance.\n\nTo match this style, I need to:\n\n1. **Use clear headers with emojis** to categorize sections (e.g., 🎨 for design prompts, 📊 for CSV structures).\n2. **Provide niche-specific product examples** with creative prompts and SEO keywords.\n3. **Include technical details** such as aspect ratios, DALL-E prompts, and optimization tips for platforms like mydesigns.io.\n4. **Structure CSV data** with SEO columns like \"Traffic Source\" and \"Conversion Tactic\".\n5. Add **actionable next steps** and A/B testing suggestions.\n\nI also notice the use of markdown formatting, bullet points, and code blocks for CSV examples. The tone is professional yet approachable, with occasional emojis for emphasis.\n\nPotential pitfalls to avoid:\n- Overcomplicating the CSV structure; keep columns aligned with the user’s existing framework.\n- Ensuring design prompts are vivid and specific enough for DALL-E generation.\n- Maintaining consistency in SEO keyword integration across all products.\n\nI'll start by drafting new design prompts for additional products in the same niches, ensuring each follows the narrative framework (Cover Image, Transition, etc.). Then, I'll update the CSV structure with relevant SEO metrics and conversion tactics, mirroring the examples provided. Finally, I'll outline clear next steps for the user to implement the strategy."

The user provided a JSON file containing a conversation with DeepSeek about analyzing and optimizing image data from a CSV. They also asked for suggestions on using mockups for products like totes, mugs, and t-shirts, and included a lot of data about trending products, design prompts, and CSV structures.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the main components here. The initial part of the conversation deals with data cleaning, validation, duplicate detection, storage analysis, metadata consistency, directory reorganization, optimization recommendations, and automation tools for image data in a CSV. Then the conversation shifts to generating design prompts for mockups on various products, focusing on trending items and optimizing designs for platforms like Etsy and Shopify.\\n\\nThe user's final request is to \\\"review and compile analyze,\\\" which I interpret as synthesizing the key points from the provided data and possibly generating a structured analysis or report. They might want a summary of the initial data analysis steps, the design prompts for mockups, and how these can be applied to the listed products.\\n\\nI need to ensure I cover both aspects: the data analysis part and the mockup design part. For the data analysis, highlighting steps like fixing date formats, handling missing values, standardizing units, detecting duplicates, and optimizing storage would be important. For the mockups, compiling the best design practices, suggested tools, and examples of effective design prompts for different product categories (like the Color Morphing Mug or Men's Pajama Pants) would be key.\\n\\nI should also check if there's any specific format the user wants the compiled analysis in, like a bullet-point list, a table, or a structured report. Since they mentioned \\\"compile analyze,\\\" a structured summary with clear sections might be best. Additionally, noting any trends or particularly successful strategies mentioned in the data, like the use of AI-generated design prompts or focusing on niche markets (e.g., dark humor, anime-inspired merch), would add value.\\n\\nPotential challenges include the sheer volume of data provided. I need to extract the most relevant information without getting bogged down in details. Also, ensuring that the analysis is actionable, providing clear steps or recommendations based on the data.\\n\\nFinally, I should verify if the user needs any additional information or if there's a specific aspect they want emphasized, like CSV optimization for Printify uploads or the integration of design prompts into their workflow.

Each image batch should have a cover image, transition image, main image, and filler image, each serving a specific purpose in the narrative. The aspect ratios are important: 9:16, 16:9, and 1:1. The user emphasized combining cyberpunk elements with indie-folk aesthetics, which seems a bit challenging but interesting.\\n\\nI should start by creating the first batch of four images. The cover image needs to set the tone with dominant typography. Maybe a neon-lit alley with rebellious graffiti. The transition image could focus on a symbolic object like a wilted rose on asphalt. The main image should be the emotional core, perhaps a rebellious raccoon in punk attire. The filler image could be a neon heart with glitching effects.\\n\\nI need to ensure each image adheres to the specified aspect ratios and integrates typography into the environment. Also, the user mentioned generating two batches if necessary to reach four images. I should check if the first batch covers all required elements or if I need a second batch for more exploration.\\n\\nWait, the user also mentioned SEO optimization and Etsy/YouTube-friendly titles. I should come up with catchy titles for each image. Maybe something like \\\"Neon Rebellion: Cyberpunk Alley Chronicles\\\" for the cover image. \\n\\nI need to make sure the color palettes match the genres—neon hues for cyberpunk and softer tones for indie-folk. Lighting is crucial too: high contrast for cyberpunk and softer lighting for folk elements. \\n\\nLet me outline each image with titles, descriptions, and technical specs.

The analysis already covers optimizing image data CSV, mockup design strategies, and CSV structure for Printify. The \\\"trending.md\\\" file includes specific product listings, design prompts, and examples of how to structure a CSV for trending products.\\n\\nThe user might want the trending product data integrated into the existing recommendations. For instance, the mockup design strategies section could be expanded with the specific design prompts from \\\"trending.md\\\". Also, the CSV structure section might need to incorporate the additional columns and examples provided in the trending data.\\n\\nI need to check for overlaps and ensure consistency. For example, the existing CSV example in the analysis has columns like Title, Description, Retail Price, Template Size, and Design Prompt. The trending.md file includes similar columns but with more detailed entries and possibly additional fields. I should align these to create a comprehensive CSV structure.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the design prompts. The analysis provides example prompts for different products, and \\\"trending.md\\\" offers more detailed and varied prompts. Integrating these into the mockup strategies would make the recommendations more robust.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final recommendations include actionable steps like automation, AI tool usage, niche targeting, and SEO optimization, all of which are mentioned in the original analysis. The trending data can serve as concrete examples to support these recommendations.\\n\\nPotential issues might be redundancy or conflicting information. I need to merge the content without duplicating sections. Also, maintaining clarity is crucial so that the user can easily follow the enhanced recommendations.\\n\\nFinally, formatting the enhanced analysis to be visually organized with clear sections, bullet points, and tables will help the user navigate the document efficiently.

Likely a typo; verify with the user).\\n   - **Handle Missing Values**: \\n     - Fill empty `DPI_X`/`DPI_Y` fields (e.g., infer based on file type or use default values like 72 for web or 300 for print).\\n     - Investigate the \\\"Unknown\\\" file size entry (`3D Two Sided Gnome Ornament_temp.jpg`).\\n   - **Standardize Units**: Ensure all file sizes use consistent units (e.g., KB/MB) for easier analysis.\\n\\n### 2. **Duplicate Detection**\\n   - Identify duplicates or near-duplicates (e.g., `romantic-gnome-proposal.jpeg` vs. `romantic-gnome-proposal.jpg`) using filenames, paths, and dimensions.\\n   - Remove redundant files or consolidate versions.\\n\\n### 3. **Storage Analysis**\\n   - **Breakdown by Format**: Summarize file counts and total storage usage by format (PNG, JPEG, etc.).\\n   - **Directory Analysis**: Calculate storage consumption per subfolder (e.g., `Snowman_Action`, `9-16`, `bubble`).\\n   - **Large Files**: Flag files over 5 MB (e.g., `Cosmic_Skeleton_Tarot_Deck.png` at 7.25 MB) for potential optimization.\\n\\n### 4. **Metadata Consistency**\\n   - **DPI Check**: \\n     - Ensure print-targeted images (e.g., PNGs with design keywords) have 300 DPI.\\n     - Lower DPI (72-96) for web-only files to reduce size.\\n   - **Dimension Validation**: Confirm that images in subfolders like `9-16` (likely 9:16 aspect ratio) match expected dimensions (e.g., 1542x2700).\\n\\n### 5. **Directory Reorganization**\\n   - Group files by project or purpose (e.g., `Valentines-Day`, `Harry-Potter-Tumbler`, `Raccoon_Lemon_Transparency`).\\n   - Merge overlapping categories (e.g., `webp` and `png` subfolders under `Snowman_Action`).\\n\\n### 6. **Optimization Recommendations**\\n   - **Compress Large Files**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageMagick to reduce PNG/JPEG sizes without quality loss.\\n   - **Convert Formats**: Replace oversized PNGs with WebP for web use.\\n   - **Batch Processing**: Automate DPI adjustments and resizing with scripts (e.g., Python + Pillow).\\n\\n### 7. **Automation Tools**\\n   - **Python Scripts**: Use pandas to analyze CSV data and generate reports (e.g., storage usage, missing metadata).\\n   - **Image Tools**: Use ExifTool or Pillow to batch-update DPI/dimensions.\\n\\n### Example Output Summary:\\n| **Category**               | **Action Items**                                                                 |\\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| **High-Priority Fixes**     | Correct dates, resolve \\\"Unknown\\\" file size, fix missing DPI values.              |\\n| **Storage Savings**         | Optimize 50+ files >5 MB (e.g., `MysteriousHoodedFigure.png` at 6.24 MB).        |\\n| **Metadata Updates**        | Standardize 300 DPI for print files, 72 DPI for web files.                       |\\n| **Directory Cleanup**       | Merge `webp`/`png` folders; reorganize by project themes.                        |\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, you can streamline file management, improve performance for web/print use, and reduce storage costs.\",\"thinking_enabled\":true,\"thinking_content\":\"Okay, let me look at this CSV file. First, I need to understand what data it contains. The columns are Filename, File Size, Creation Date, Width, Height, DPI_X, DPI_Y, and Original Path. It seems like this is metadata for image files stored in different directories under \\\"/Users/steven/Pictures/etsy/\\\".\\n\\nHmm, there are a lot of entries here. Let me check some rows. For example, the first row is \\\"north_pole_hot_chocolate_christmas_blend.png\\\" with a file size of 476.07 KB, created on 04-09-25, dimensions 720x348, DPI of approximately 300 for both X and Y, and the path is under the main Etsy directory. \\n\\nI notice that some entries have missing DPI values. Like the row with \\\"DALL·E 2024-07-21 22.31.52 - A raccoon...\\\" has empty DPI_X and DPI_Y. Also, there are multiple file formats: PNG, JPEG, JPG, and some files are in subdirectories like \\\"Snowman_Action/webp\\\" and \\\"9-16\\\".\\n\\nThe file sizes vary a lot. Some are as small as 64.74 KB (\\\"Vintage-Mothers-Day-Funny-Mama-Bundle-Graphics-118804765-580x387.jpg\\\") and others go up to 7.50 MB (\\\"ZeTaEKGC0hqSwUAwd9UBykzJ_1718669844_1735187.png\\\"). The creation dates are mostly \\\"04-09-25\\\" and \\\"04-29-25\\\". Wait, \\\"04-29-25\\\" might be a typo? Because April only has 30 days. Maybe it's supposed to be 04-09-25 or another date.\\n\\nLooking at the paths, there are images in various subfolders: \\\"Snowman_Action/webp\\\", \\\"Snowman_Action/png\\\", \\\"9-16\\\", \\\"1-1\\\", \\\"lemonsqueezy\\\", \\\"250\\\", \\\"bubble\\\", \\\"Inspired-by-Harry-Potter-Tumbler-112322382\\\", and \\\"original_images\\\". This suggests the files are organized into different categories or projects.\\n\\nThe DPI values are mostly around 300, which is standard for print quality, but some are 72 DPI, which is typical for web. A few entries have 96 DPI or 762 DPI, which seems unusual. There's also a row with \\\"File Size\\\" listed as \\\"Unknown\\\" for \\\"3D Two Sided Gnome Ornament_temp.jpg\\\".\\n\\nThere are duplicate filenames with different paths or slight variations, like \\\"romantic-gnome-proposal.jpeg\\\" and \\\"romantic-gnome-proposal.jpg\\\", which might be different versions of the same image.\\n\\nThe user might want to organize these files better, check for duplicates, ensure consistent metadata (like DPI), or analyze storage usage. Maybe they need to optimize images for web or print, or migrate files to a new structure.\\n\\nPotential steps could include:\\n\\n1. **Data Cleaning**: Fix any incorrect dates, fill in missing DPI values, and standardize file formats.\\n2. **Duplicate Check**: Identify and handle duplicate or similar filenames.\\n3. **Storage Analysis**: Summarize file sizes by format or directory to manage storage.\\n4. **Metadata Consistency**: Ensure all images have appropriate DPI settings based on their use case (e.g., 300 DPI for print, 72 DPI for web).\\n5. **Directory Structure**: Evaluate the folder structure for better organization, maybe consolidating or categorizing differently.\\n6. **File Optimization**: Recommend compressing large files without losing quality, especially for web use.\\n\\nThey might also want to use scripts or tools to automate some of these tasks, like a Python script with pandas for data analysis, or image processing tools like ImageMagick for batch adjustments.\",\"thinking_elapsed_secs\":40,\"ban_edit\":false,\"ban_regenerate\":false,\"status\":\"FINISHED\",\"accumulated_token_usage\":52007,\"files\":[],\"tips\":[{\"type\":\"warning\",\"position\":\"top\",\"content\":\"Length limit reached.

            "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided several files related to image data CSV optimization and design strategies. The main goal seems to be generating design prompts for products like hoodies, mugs, and tote bags, adhering to specific narrative-driven frameworks and technical specifications like aspect ratios and SEO optimization.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure they want. They mentioned batches of images with roles like Cover Image, Transition, Main Image, and Filler. Each product should have these elements in a narrative flow. For example, a Retro Gaming Hoodie would start with a Cover Image introducing the theme, then a Transition image shifting the mood, followed by a Main Image highlighting core action, and a Filler for emotional depth.\n\nThe user also emphasized technical details: 9:16 aspect ratio, solid backgrounds, vibrant colors, and isolated graphics for platforms like mydesigns.io. Additionally, after each batch, they want new ideas to expand the narrative. The examples provided in the files show a clear pattern of integrating SEO keywords and structuring CSVs with titles, descriptions, categories, prices, sizes, and design prompts.\n\nOne challenge is ensuring that each image prompt aligns with its narrative role while maintaining technical specs. For instance, a Cover Image for a Cyberpunk Phone Case needs to set the scene with neon cityscapes and glowing circuitry, while a Transition might focus on a close-up detail like circuitry transforming into vines.\n\nAnother point is the need for creativity within niche markets—geeky, dark humor, anime. Each prompt should reflect the product's niche. For example, a Dark Humor Apocalypse Calendar might have a burnt-paper aesthetic with sarcastic quotes, transitioning to crumbling pages revealing hidden messages.\n\nI also need to ensure consistency in the CSV structure, including SEO-friendly titles and descriptions. The examples provided use specific keywords and phrases that target the intended audience, like \"Cyberpunk Tech Accessories\" or \"Sarcastic Office Decor.\"\n\nFinally, proposing new ideas for continuation requires staying within the product's theme but introducing fresh elements, like adding a glitch effect to a hoodie design or creating a surreal kitchen scene for cat stickers.\n\nBy following the provided examples and integrating the narrative framework with technical and SEO requirements, I can create structured, effective design prompts and CSV entries that meet the user's needs."

            "content": "Alright, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a detailed Markdown-formatted table with product names, descriptions, prices, and dimensions. They also included design prompts for each product. The user mentioned wanting a formatted version using Markdown syntax and provided an example. \n\nFirst, I need to ensure that the final output follows the same structure as the example but includes all the products listed. The example uses headers with emojis, product categories in bold, and tables with specific columns. The design prompts are detailed and include reasons why they work.\n\nI should check if all products mentioned in the user's content are included in the table. For instance, the \"Color Morphing Mug,\" \"Men's Pajama Pants,\" \"Framed Horizontal Poster,\" etc., are all there. Each product has a corresponding design prompt in the initial part of the content. \n\nNext, I need to make sure the tables are correctly formatted with the right columns: Product Name, Description, Price, and Dimensions. The user's example table uses pipes and colons for alignment, which is standard in Markdown. I'll replicate that structure.\n\nAlso, the design prompts are separated by sections with headers and subheaders, using emojis to categorize each product. I should maintain that consistency. Each prompt has a \"Why it works?\" section, which provides justification for the design choice. These should be included as bullet points under each prompt.\n\nI need to verify that all SEO keywords and technical specs mentioned in the user's previous examples, like aspect ratios and DALL-E 3 optimizations, are incorporated if necessary. However, the user's final request seems focused on formatting the provided content into Markdown, so maybe those technical details are already handled.\n\nPotential issues might include missing products or mismatched descriptions. I'll cross-reference the product list with the design prompts to ensure each product has a corresponding prompt. For example, the \"Scented Soy Candle, 9oz\" has a prompt, so it should be included in the table.\n\nAnother consideration is maintaining the visual appeal with proper use of bold text, emojis, and section breaks. The user's example uses horizontal lines (`---`) to separate sections, which I'll replicate. Also, ensuring that all markdown syntax is correct to prevent rendering issues.\n\nFinally, the user might want the CSV structure mentioned earlier integrated, but based on the latest input, the focus is on the design prompts and product table. So I'll prioritize formatting those elements accurately.\n\nIn summary, the steps are:\n1. Replicate the Markdown structure from the user's example.\n2. Include all products and their corresponding design prompts.\n3. Ensure tables are correctly formatted with the right columns.\n4. Maintain consistency in headers, emojis, and section breaks.\n5. Verify all content is present and correctly placed."

            "content": "Okay, I need to help the user expand their existing analysis of Etsy bestseller data by incorporating new insights and structuring it in a way that aligns with their previous content. Let me start by reviewing what they've already provided.\n\nThe user's current analysis includes sections like Top-Performing Products, Pricing Trends, Popular Themes & Tags, Shop Performance, Conversion & Visibility, and Recommendations. They want to expand this analysis, likely by adding more depth, perhaps new sections, or enhancing existing ones with additional data or insights.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the existing sections and see where there might be gaps or opportunities for expansion. The Top-Performing Products section lists a few examples, but maybe they can add more products or delve deeper into why these products are successful. The Pricing Trends section could benefit from more specific data points or visualizations. Popular Themes & Tags might need a breakdown of how these tags correlate with sales performance. Shop Performance could include more examples or case studies. Conversion & Visibility might be expanded with strategies to improve these metrics.\n\nThe user also provided a section called \"Key Takeaway,\" which summarizes the main points. To expand, perhaps adding sub-sections under each main category would help. For example, under Pricing Trends, discussing the psychology behind pricing strategies on Etsy. Under Popular Themes & Tags, analyzing the effectiveness of certain tags versus others.\n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned new data points like \"Est. Monthly Revenue,\" \"Total Sales,\" \"Price,\" and \"Key Tags.\" These can be further analyzed to identify patterns. For instance, are products with certain tags consistently higher priced? Do higher-priced items have lower conversion rates but higher revenue per sale?\n\nI should also consider the user's previous content structure. They used tables and bullet points effectively, so maintaining that format while adding more detailed tables or charts (even if textual) could enhance readability. Including more specific examples from the data provided, like the \"Potter Cats Sweatshirt\" or \"National Park Shirt,\" to illustrate points would make the analysis more concrete.\n\nAnother area to expand is the Recommendations section. The user has some good suggestions, but they could be more actionable. For example, instead of just \"Optimize Tags,\" provide specific tools or methods for tag optimization. Similarly, for \"Leverage Seasonal Trends,\" include a timeline or checklist for preparing seasonal products.\n\nThe user also included a \"Key Takeaway\" section, which is great, but maybe adding a \"Future Opportunities\" section could highlight emerging trends or underserved niches based on the data.\n\nI need to ensure that any expansion aligns with the user's goal of providing actionable insights for Etsy sellers. This means focusing on practical advice backed by data. For example, if digital products have high conversion rates, discussing how to create or market them effectively.\n\nPotential challenges include ensuring that the expanded analysis doesn't become too verbose or lose focus. It's important to keep each section concise but informative. Also, verifying that all data points are accurately represented and that recommendations are feasible for typical Etsy sellers.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the expanded analysis by adding new subsections, enhancing existing ones with more detailed data, and providing clearer, step-by-step recommendations. Using the same Markdown formatting as before will maintain consistency and readability."

            "content": "Okay, the user wants me to update and improve their Etsy analysis by incorporating aspect ratios that adjust to different products and designs. Let me start by understanding their current analysis. They have a detailed breakdown of top-performing products, pricing trends, tags, and recommendations. The user mentioned aspect ratios, so I need to integrate how different image dimensions can optimize each product category.\n\nFirst, I should recall what aspect ratios are commonly used. For Etsy, product images might vary between square (1:1), vertical (9:16), and horizontal (16:9). Each product type probably benefits from a specific ratio. For example, apparel might look better in vertical formats to show the full design, while digital products might use square thumbnails.\n\nLooking at their current data, they have products like sweatshirts, mugs, posters, and digital SVGs. Each of these would need different aspect ratios. I should create guidelines for each category. Also, they mentioned mockups and videos, so including aspect ratios for those would be important too.\n\nI need to ensure that the aspect ratios are tied to the design strengths. For instance, a vertical 9:16 ratio for apparel allows showcasing the entire garment, while a square ratio for mugs focuses on the design. Videos in 9:16 could be more engaging on mobile, which is crucial since many Etsy shoppers use mobile devices.\n\nNext, I'll update the existing sections. In the product deep dive, I'll add recommended aspect ratios. The pricing strategy can include how different ratios affect conversion rates. The tag optimization might not directly relate, but the visibility boost framework should include image and video ratios.\n\nSeasonal roadmap and implementation checklist should mention preparing content in appropriate ratios ahead of time. Also, the mockup strategy needs to highlight aspect ratio adjustments for different platforms like Pinterest vs. TikTok.\n\nI should check if there's any existing data on how aspect ratios impact Etsy sales. If not, I can make educated guesses based on general e-commerce trends. For example, vertical images perform better on mobile, which is significant since Etsy has a mobile-heavy user base.\n\nFinally, ensure that the recommendations are actionable. Instead of just stating ratios, provide specific examples and maybe even templates. The user likely wants clear, practical steps to adjust their product images and videos for better performance.\n\nI need to make sure all the added aspect ratio advice is integrated smoothly into the existing structure without overwhelming the original content. Balance is key here—enhance the analysis without deviating from the core insights."

            "content": "Okay, so the user wants me to review the best-selling products on Etsy, Redbubble, and TikTok Shop and list their resolutions and other specs. Let me start by recalling what each platform is known for.\n\nEtsy is more about handmade, vintage, and unique items. Redbubble focuses on artist-designed merchandise like t-shirts, stickers, and posters. TikTok Shop is newer, with a focus on viral, trendy products often showcased in short videos.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the best-selling product categories on each platform. For Etsy, I remember things like personalized jewelry, home decor, and craft supplies. Redbubble's top sellers are probably graphic tees, phone cases, and stickers. TikTok Shop trends might include gadgets, beauty products, and quirky accessories that go viral.\n\nNext, I should determine the recommended image resolutions and aspect ratios for each platform. Etsy usually prefers square images (1:1) for thumbnails but also supports other ratios. Redbubble might have specific requirements for different products, like t-shirts needing high-res images for printing. TikTok Shop likely uses vertical videos (9:16) because of its mobile-first approach.\n\nI need to check if there are official guidelines from each platform. For example, Etsy recommends at least 2000x2000 pixels for product photos. Redbubble might require higher resolutions for print quality, maybe 4500x5400 pixels for apparel. TikTok Shop probably emphasizes video content, so resolutions like 1080x1920 for vertical videos would be key.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned aspect ratios adjusting to the product and designs. So, I should note how different products might need different formats. For instance, a t-shirt on Redbubble might need a standard front and back view, while a TikTok video for the same product would need engaging, dynamic shots.\n\nI should also consider the technical specs like file formats. Etsy supports JPG, PNG; Redbubble might prefer PNG for transparency. TikTok videos are usually MP4 or MOV.\n\nWait, the user also wants a list of best-selling products with their resolutions. Maybe I can structure this by platform, then product category, with examples, resolutions, and aspect ratios. Including why those specs work would add value, like higher resolution for print quality or vertical videos for mobile engagement.\n\nI should verify some examples. For Etsy, a best-seller like personalized necklaces: image resolution around 2000x2000, 1:1 ratio. Redbubble's graphic tees might use 4500x5400 for detailed prints. TikTok Shop's viral products like phone grips could use 1080x1920 videos.\n\nI need to make sure the information is accurate. Maybe cross-reference platform guidelines or successful seller examples. Also, highlight how adhering to these specs improves visibility and sales, like Etsy's image quality affecting search ranking.\n\nIncluding tips for optimization would be helpful, like using mockups or editing tools. Maybe mention tools like Canva for resizing or Adobe Spark for video editing tailored to each platform's requirements.\n\nFinally, summarize with a comparison table for quick reference across Etsy, Redbubble, and TikTok Shop, covering product types, resolutions, aspect ratios, and formats. That would make the information easily digestible."

            "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a detailed CSV structure for Printify products and wants me to adapt it to include aspects like resolutions, aspect ratios, and design prompts based on previous discussions about best-selling products on Etsy, Redbubble, and TikTok Shop. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing CSV format they provided. It includes columns like Title, Description, Category, Retail Price, Sizes, Template Size (px), and Design Prompt. The goal is to enhance this structure by incorporating the resolution and aspect ratio strategies discussed earlier.\n\nThe user mentioned adapting to something similar to their provided CSV but with added elements like resolutions and aspect ratios. In the previous interactions, there was a focus on platform-specific optimizations, such as Etsy preferring 1:1 thumbnails, TikTok Shop needing 9:16 vertical videos, etc. So, the challenge is to integrate these technical specifications into the CSV in a way that's organized and useful for bulk uploading to Printify.\n\nI should consider which columns need to be added or modified. The existing CSV has \"Template Size (px)\", which refers to resolution. However, the user also emphasized aspect ratios (like 1:1, 9:16) depending on the product type and platform. Maybe adding separate columns for Aspect Ratio and Platform-Specific Optimization would help. Also, including SEO Keywords and Traffic Source as per previous examples could enhance the CSV's usefulness.\n\nAnother thing to note is the Design Prompt column. In the user's example, these prompts are detailed, guiding the design process. I should ensure that these prompts align with the aspect ratios and resolutions specified. For instance, a mug design might need a vertical 4:5 ratio for lifestyle shots on Etsy, so the design prompt should reflect that.\n\nI need to maintain consistency in the product categories and ensure that each product has accurate and optimized specifications. For example, apparel like hoodies might require different resolutions and aspect ratios compared to home decor items like candles. Also, considering the platform (Etsy vs. TikTok Shop), the specifications might vary, so adding a column for recommended platforms could be beneficial.\n\nI should also check if all necessary columns are included. The user's previous CSV had columns for SEO Keywords and Traffic Source, which are important for marketing. Including these could help in organizing the products better for different marketing strategies.\n\nPotential issues might include ensuring that the resolutions and aspect ratios are correctly matched to each product type and platform. For example, a phone case on Redbubble needs a different resolution compared to a TikTok Shop video. I need to make sure each product's specifications are accurately reflected.\n\nFinally, the user wants the CSV to be ready for bulk upload, so the format must be compatible with Printify's requirements. I should verify that all columns are appropriately named and that the data fits within Printify's guidelines.\n\nIn summary, the steps I need to follow are:\n1. Review the existing CSV structure and identify necessary additions (Aspect Ratio, SEO Keywords, Traffic Source, Platform-Specific Optimization).\n2. Update each product row with the correct resolutions and aspect ratios based on product type and platform.\n3. Ensure design prompts are tailored to the specified resolutions and aspect ratios.\n4. Validate that all information aligns with best practices for Etsy, Redbubble, and TikTok Shop.\n5. Format the CSV correctly for Printify bulk upload, ensuring no errors in column names or data formatting."

They also included a comprehensive SEO analytics structure and asked to apply that structure to their CSV data. Let me break down their request step by step.\n\nFirst, the user wants more design prompts for specific niches like geeky, dark humor, and anime. They also want the CSV data structured for bulk upload, incorporating the SEO analytics framework they provided. The challenge here is to merge the SEO structure with the existing product data from the CSV, ensuring that each product entry includes SEO-relevant metrics and strategies.\n\nI need to start by understanding the SEO framework they provided. It includes sections like keyword performance, organic traffic, conversion rate optimization, backlink authority, and engagement metrics. Each of these sections has specific metrics and visual representations. My task is to map these SEO elements to the product data in the CSV.\n\nNext, for the design prompts, I should generate creative and niche-specific ideas that align with the products listed. For example, geeky designs could involve tech or gaming themes, dark humor might include sarcastic or edgy graphics, and anime would feature popular characters or styles from that genre.\n\nThe CSV finalization requires organizing the product data into a structured format that includes columns like Title, Description, Category, Retail Price, Sizes, Template Size, and Design Prompt. Additionally, incorporating SEO metrics means adding sections or columns that reflect keyword rankings, traffic sources, conversion rates, backlink quality, and engagement statistics related to each product.\n\nOne potential confusion is how to integrate SEO metrics into a product CSV. Typically, SEO data pertains to web content rather than physical products. To resolve this, I might need to interpret the SEO framework metaphorically, applying concepts like keyword performance to product titles and descriptions, conversion rates to product sales performance, and engagement metrics to customer interaction with product pages.\n\nAnother point is ensuring that the design prompts are not only creative but also optimized for SEO. This means using keywords in the design descriptions that align with what users might search for. For example, a geeky t-shirt design prompt could include terms like \"retro gaming\" or \"cyberpunk,\" which are likely search terms in that niche.\n\nI also need to maintain consistency in the CSV format, ensuring that all entries follow the same structure and that data types are uniform. This includes standardizing units for price, sizes, and template dimensions. Additionally, the design prompts should be descriptive enough to guide the creation of the product images while incorporating SEO-friendly language.\n\nFinally, I should review the entire CSV for any errors or inconsistencies, such as missing fields or mismatched data types. Ensuring that the SEO metrics are logically tied to the product entries will make the CSV both functional for bulk upload and informative for marketing strategies.\n\nIn summary, the key steps are:\n\n1. Generate niche-specific design prompts that are SEO-optimized.\n\n2. Structure the CSV to include product details alongside SEO metrics.\n\n3. Ensure data consistency and accuracy in the CSV.\n\n4. Metaphorically apply the SEO framework to product entries for enhanced marketability.\n\nBy following these steps, the user will have a comprehensive CSV that not only lists products but also integrates SEO strategies to boost their online visibility and sales performance.\n\n🎨 Niche-Specific Design Prompts + 📊 SEO-Optimized CSV Finalization\nLet’s merge your SEO framework with the product data to create a high-impact CSV for bulk uploads.
