            "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants to improve their YouTube SEO prompts by adding better optimization, emoji usage, trendiness, etc. They provided a JSON structure with some existing prompts and want suggestions to enhance them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the original structure. There are two main sections: \"short youtube seo\" and \"seo-trendy\", each with their own prompts. The goals are to generate creative filenames, titles, descriptions, tags, chapters, and leverage SEO strategies. The user mentioned adding emojis, better optimization, and aligning with current trends like \"trendxty\" (maybe they meant trendy or a specific trend?).\n\nLooking at the existing prompts, they might be a bit repetitive. For example, the \"seo-trendy\" prompt is duplicated, which could be consolidated. Also, the structure isn't very clear—maybe organizing the sections better would help. \n\nI should think about adding more specific instructions for using emojis, perhaps suggesting where and how many to use. SEO optimization could include keyword placement strategies, like including keywords in the first few sentences of the description. They might also benefit from including current trends, like using popular hashtags or referencing viral challenges.\n\nThe user mentioned \"trendxty\"—maybe that's a typo or a specific term they want included. I'll assume it's a typo and focus on trendy aspects. Also, the chapters and timestamps part needs to be formatted correctly, maybe with examples.\n\nAnother point is the tone and style guidelines. The original prompt mentions sarcastic, fun, or themed designs. Expanding on that with specific emoji recommendations for each tone could help. For example, whimsical might use �🐉✨, while dark and moody could use 🖤🌑🔮.\n\nIncluding a checklist or step-by-step process in the prompt might make it more actionable. Also, ensuring that the prompts ask for variations based on feedback, A/B testing for titles, and maybe even competitor analysis for SEO keywords.\n\nI should also consider the structure of the YouTube description. Bullet points with emojis, proper keyword density, and a call to action. Tags should be a mix of broad and niche keywords, maybe with some trending tags.\n\nWait, the user wants both Shorts and normal YouTube titles. So the prompt should specify creating two versions. Maybe adding character limits (Shorts titles are shorter) and platform-specific trends.\n\nExamples would help. Providing a sample title and description with emojis and SEO elements can guide the user. Also, mentioning tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ for keyword research could be a plus, but since it's a prompt, maybe just hinting at using SEO tools.\n\nI need to ensure that the revised prompt is clear, avoids redundancy, and covers all aspects: emojis, SEO optimization, trendy elements, structure for titles, descriptions, tags, chapters, and maybe engagement hooks like asking viewers to comment.\n\nLastly, formatting the JSON nicely with proper sections and maybe combining similar parts to reduce repetition. Also, adding a section for hashtag suggestions at the end of the description could be beneficial."

            "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants to consolidate and improve the existing prompts for YouTube SEO, specifically for four different use cases. They provided the current prompts and some example outputs, so I need to analyze those to see what's working and what can be better.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each of the four prompts individually.\n\n1. **Creative YouTube SEO**: This prompt is about adding emojis, optimizing SEO keywords, generating descriptions, tags, and bullet points. It also mentions adding timestamps and chapters. The example output includes a title, description, bullet points, and tags. But the original prompt seems a bit repetitive and might need clearer structure.\n\n2. **Short YouTube SEO**: This one is focused on creating playful and themed titles for shorts and normal videos. The example uses emojis and catchy phrases. However, the prompt could benefit from more specific guidelines on tone (sarcastic, fun) and how to tie it to content themes.\n\n3. **SEO-Trendy**: Similar to the first but with a focus on trends. The example includes chapters starting at 0:00. The prompt here is also repetitive and might need differentiation from the first one, maybe emphasizing trend analysis more.\n\n4. **Typog**: This is for creating a typography cover image. The prompt asks for a vibrant, edgy style that reflects the content. The example seems okay, but the user might want more specific instructions on integrating keywords or themes into the design.\n\nCommon issues across the prompts: \n- Repetition in instructions (e.g., \"add emoji\", \"be creative\").\n- Lack of clear structure in some prompts.\n- Overlap between \"creative youtube seo\" and \"seo-trendy\" – need to distinguish their purposes.\n- The \"short youtube seo\" prompt could be more specific about tone and style.\n\nNow, considering the user's request for consolidation and optimization, I should merge similar elements and clarify each prompt's unique focus. Also, integrating better emoji strategies, SEO keyword optimization, and trend awareness as per the previous interaction where they mentioned \"trendxty\" and better optimization.\n\nFor each prompt, I'll need to:\n\n- **Clarify Objectives**: Make sure each prompt has a distinct purpose.\n- **Enhance SEO Elements**: Include specific strategies for keyword placement, trend integration, and emoji usage.\n- **Structure for Clarity**: Use bullet points or sections to make the prompt easier to follow.\n- **Add Examples**: Where applicable, include examples to guide the output.\n- **Incorporate Feedback**: From the previous answer, use elements like Trendxty integration, emoji science, and algorithm hacks.\n\nLet me start with the \"creative youtube seo\" prompt. The original is focused on descriptions, tags, bullet points. I can structure it into sections: Title, Description, Bullet Points, Tags, Timestamps. Add guidelines on emoji placement and SEO keywords. Maybe include examples of good vs. bad practices.\n\nFor \"short youtube seo\", the focus is on catchy titles. Need to specify different styles (sarcastic, whimsical) and include emoji strategies. Maybe add rules like using trending phrases or urgency triggers.\n\n\"SEO-Trendy\" should emphasize current trends and maybe platform-specific optimizations (Shorts vs. Long-form). Integrate Trendxty elements like momentum mapping and engagement baits.\n\n\"Typog\" needs to ensure the cover image reflects the video's content and SEO keywords. Maybe include specific design elements related to the topic, like using symbols that represent the themes (e.g., mountains for Seven Mountains Mandate).\n\nI should also check for consistency in terminology and ensure each prompt clearly differentiates from the others. Avoid redundancy by merging overlapping instructions and assigning unique aspects to each prompt.\n\nPotential challenges: Ensuring that each prompt is distinct yet comprehensive. Also, making sure that the instructions are actionable enough for someone to generate the desired output without ambiguity.\n\nAfter restructuring, I'll need to validate if the consolidated prompts cover all necessary aspects from the examples provided and the user's request for better optimization and trend integration."

For \"{content}\":  \n\n**📈 Trend Integration:**  \n- Identify 2 rising Google Trends keywords (e.g., \"Christian nationalism 2025\")  \n- Cross-reference TikTok sounds (e.g., \"Oh Lord\" viral audio)  \n- Add 1 \"engagement bait\" question (\"Will this happen by 2025? Comment!\")  \n\n**🎬 Platform-Specific Rules:**  \n- Shorts: 3AM challenge hooks + cursed emojis (👁️⚰️)  \n- Long-Form: 3-part chapter structure (Exposure → Consequences → Defense)  \n\n**🔮 Predictive Elements:**  \n- Include 1 speculative phrase (\"Experts say 2025 will...\")  \n- Add 1 Nostradamus-style prediction (\"Ancient text predicts this move\")  \n```  \n**Example Output:**  \n```\n📈 Rising Keywords: #2025Prophecy, #SevenMountains  \n🎬 Shorts Hook: \"Testing the 7 Mountains Ritual at 3AM 👁️⚰️ (Sound ON!)\"  \n🔮 Prediction: \"2025: The Year Religion Takes Over? 🔥⛰️\"  \n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Typography Conspiracy Designer**  \n**Objective:** *Create covertly thematic cover art embedding symbolic messaging.*  \n**Prompt:**  \n```\nDesign a 9:16 cover image for \"{content}\" with HIDDEN symbolism:  \n\n**🎨 Visual Elements:**  \n- Primary Text: Distorted bold font dripping \"blood\" (hex #8b0000)  \n- Background: Smoky Capitol Building silhouette with 7 glowing mountain peaks  \n- Hidden Details: Eyes in shadows, faint \"2025\" etched in rubble  \n\n**⚙️ Technical Specs:**  \n- Color Palette: Dark academia (burgundy/gold/obsidian)  \n- Texture: Grunge paper overlay at 30% opacity  \n- Font Style: \"Conspiracy Theory\" stencil font (Dafont)  \n\n**🔍 SEO Integration:**  \n- Embed keyword in image: \"Seven Mountains\" as cracked ground texture  \n```  \n**Example Output:**  \n```\n\"Cover Art: Ominous blood-red 'DOMINION' text over shadowy Capitol, 7 glowing mountains in background, hidden eyes watching. Dark academia palette with '2025' faintly carved. 9:16, grunge texture, stencil font.\"  \n```\n\n---\n\n**Key Upgrades:**  \n1. **Strategic Differentiation** – Each prompt now has unique triggers (Shorts urgency vs. long-form conspiracy depth).  \n2. **Trendxty Integration** – TikTok sound cross-pollination, predictive keywords.  \n3. **Covert Symbolism** – Typography prompts embed SEO keywords visually.  \n4. **Platform-Specific Rules** – Shorts use cursed/urgent emojis; long-form uses chapter psychology.  \n\nLet me know if you want to stress-test any component! 🕵️‍♂️🔍"

class=\"conversation-content-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"conversation-content\">\n            <p>Based on the narrative themes and the structure you've described, I will craft an intricate, symbolic power hierarchy and corresponding figures for the loyalist hierarchy, along with compelling foes and heroes. Here's the progression:</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Loyalist Hierarchy: The Heritage of HaTe Foundation</strong></h3>\n<p>A nefarious, theocratic organization cloaked in nationalist fervor, this hierarchy mirrors extreme authoritarian power structures. Each level is imbued with symbolic roles that highlight their cruelty and lack of empathy. They rule under the guise of \"restoration and purity.\"</p>\n<h4><strong>1. The Apex Authority: “The Messiah of Mar-a-Lies”</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-World Parallels:</strong> A figure resembling Donald Trump but even more grotesque in satirical depiction.</li>\n<li><strong>Role:</strong> The self-proclaimed savior of the Dominion, who rules with unchecked power and projects himself as a divine figure.</li>\n<li><strong>Personality:</strong> Charismatic in a toxic way, using bluster, fear, and cult-like rhetoric. Detached from reality, he thrives on adulation and maintains control through propaganda.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Seated in the crumbling golden palace of Mar-a-Lies, surrounded by gaudy relics and screens broadcasting his decrees.</li>\n<li><strong>Quirks:</strong> Obsessed with his image, often distracted by trivial matters while ignoring crises. Speaks in platitudes laden with ironic self-praise.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>2. The Makers of Despair (Supreme Tribunal of Piety)</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure:</strong> A council of nine zealots akin to a theocratic Supreme Court. They adjudicate on \"moral violations,\" ensuring strict adherence to oppressive laws.</li>\n<li><strong>Real-World Parallels:</strong> Figures resembling Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.</li>\n<li><strong>Roles and Personalities:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lady Purity Cross:</strong> A sanctimonious arbiter obsessed with enforcing archaic notions of “purity.” Symbolizes hypocrisy and internalized misogyny.</li>\n<li><strong>Marshal Faithstone:</strong> A former military leader turned moral enforcer, he justifies brutality as \"protection of divine order.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Lord Providence Glint:</strong> The most verbose of the council, who weaves labyrinthine justifications for barbaric punishments.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Their chamber, the Chapel of Chains, is adorned with symbols of subjugation—chains, thorns, and effigies of silent women.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>3. The Enforcers: “The Iron Choir”</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Role:</strong> A paramilitary group enforcing reproductive and moral laws. Known for their zeal, they conduct purges, public punishments, and the detainment of dissenters.</li>\n<li><strong>Leader:</strong> <strong>Commander Firebrand</strong>, an unyielding fanatic who carries out the Tribunal’s decrees without question.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Use fear and propaganda to maintain control. Patrols chant the regime’s slogans: “Bleed to Breed, or Bleed to Death.”</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Their uniforms are stark black, emblazoned with blood-red insignias representing \"the life owed to the Dominion.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>The Resistance: The Hysterectom'ites</strong></h3>\n<p>The underground rebellion represents hope, defiance, and humanity’s fight against oppression. Their leadership and symbols directly oppose the Heritage of HaTe.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. The Matron of Ashes</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Role:</strong> The enigmatic leader of the Hysterectom'ites, known only by her pseudonym.</li>\n<li><strong>Personality:</strong> Poised, deeply empathetic, and strategic, she commands loyalty through her wisdom and her personal sacrifice.</li>\n<li><strong>Backstory:</strong> A former physician who was punished for advocating reproductive autonomy. Her escape sparked the rebellion.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> Always veiled in ash-gray, she represents the resurrection of freedom from the ashes of tyranny.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>2. The Sisters of Defiance</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Structure:</strong> A council of rebels with diverse talents.</li>\n<li><strong>Key Figures:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dr. Evelyn Wright:</strong> A brilliant scientist working to expose the regime’s lies about reproduction and fertility.</li>\n<li><strong>Mara \"Flint\":</strong> A fiery tactician who leads covert strikes against the regime. Once a victim of the system, now its most ruthless saboteur.</li>\n<li><strong>Kael Thorn:</strong> A former enforcer of the Iron Choir turned rebel. His insights into the regime’s tactics make him invaluable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Symbolism:</strong> They wield crude but meaningful symbols of defiance—a flag with a broken chain, murals of faceless women, and whispers of forgotten freedoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h4><strong>3. The Land of Ashfall (or the BarrenLands)</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Role:</strong> The physical and symbolic heart of the resistance, where the Hysterectom'ites regroup and plan.</li>\n<li><strong>Description:</strong> A desolate wasteland left barren by the regime’s environmental neglect. Its scarred landscape serves as a metaphor for the women stripped of their autonomy.</li>\n<li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Filled with makeshift shelters, symbols of rebellion, and secret tunnels. Its air vibrates with quiet defiance.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Tragic Origin Stories</strong></h3>\n<p>These vignettes ground the narrative in visceral, poignant moments, showcasing the cruelty of the regime.</p>\n<h4><strong>1. Elia’s Red Balloon</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 11</li>\n<li><strong>Story:</strong> On her birthday, Elia receives a single red balloon, her one joy in a bleak existence. During the celebration, a stranger approaches, claiming her for the “First Test.” She clutches the balloon as she’s dragged away, but it slips from her hands, floating upward. Later, her inability to conceive results in her execution, branded as a “murderer of her unborn child.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>2. Mara’s Defiance</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> 14</li>\n<li><strong>Story:</strong> Taken to The Farm after her first period, Mara is subjected to indoctrination. During her first “test,” she fights back, blinding the man who tried to break her. This act of rebellion marks her as unfit for breeding, and she’s sent to the BarrenLands, where she becomes a leader in the resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>Propaganda and Slogans</strong></h3>\n<p>These highlight the regime’s cruelty while adding a darkly satirical edge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Faith Over Freedom.”</li>\n<li>“Wombs of the Nation, Unite!”</li>\n<li>“The Unbirthed are the Unworthy.”</li>\n<li>“A Childless Womb is Treason.”</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Would you like to expand further on any specific hierarchy level, character, or visual symbol for image prompts?</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n    \n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"conversation-item\">\n    <div class=\"author user\">\n        <img alt=\"You\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"conversation-content-wrapper\">\n        <div class=\"conversation-content\">\n            <p>lets expand on Tragic Origin Stories\nThese vignettes ground the narrative in visceral, poignant moments, showcasing the cruelty of the regime.\n\n1.

Each vignette reflects the regime’s cruelty while humanizing the individuals caught in its grip.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>1. Elia’s Red Balloon</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> 11<br>\n<strong>Story:</strong><br>\nElia lived in a dim tenement, one of many gray, crumbling buildings in District 9. Her mother had scrounged for months to afford the red balloon, a rare gift in a world where joy was scarce. For Elia, the balloon was magic—bright, defiant against the dreariness around her. She clutched it tightly, giggling as she watched it bob against the wind.</p>\n<p>Her laughter died when she saw him—the Stranger. A tall, grim man in the uniform of the Iron Choir, his face devoid of warmth. He marched up to her mother, shoving a parchment into her hands. “The First Test,” he said, as though it were a mere formality. Elia’s mother wept as the man grabbed her wrist.</p>\n<p>Elia fought, screaming and kicking as she was dragged down the street. Her balloon, her one bright spot of happiness, slipped from her fingers. She craned her neck, watching it drift higher and higher until it was a speck against the choking gray sky.</p>\n<p>Days later, Elia failed the test—her body too young, too frail to carry a child. The tribunal deemed her a \"murderer of potential life.\" She was executed in the public square, her mother forced to watch. As her lifeless body hung, someone tied a red balloon to her wrist—a cruel reminder of her final joy.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>2. Mara’s Defiance</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> 14<br>\n<strong>Story:</strong><br>\nMara's first period marked the end of her childhood. There was no celebration—only dread. Within hours, the Iron Choir arrived, their boots echoing in the narrow streets. “Your duty begins,” they told her. Her father tried to shield her, but a rifle butt to the jaw silenced him. Mara walked out with her head high, refusing to cry, though her heart pounded with terror.</p>\n<p>At The Farm, the indoctrination began immediately. They forced her to kneel for hours, reciting the regime’s mantras: “Bleed to Breed,” “The Womb is the Nation’s Hope.” The Priest of Policy himself delivered sermons, his booming voice declaring that a woman’s body belonged not to herself but to God and country.</p>\n<p>Her first test came three weeks later. A man twice her age, reeking of alcohol and sweat, was brought into her cell. He sneered at her, calling her \"ripe\" as he approached. Mara’s fear crystallized into rage. She waited until he was close, then struck with all her might—a shard of broken pottery she’d hidden in her fist. The jagged edge tore into his face, blinding him.</p>\n<p>Her defiance sealed her fate. Deemed “unfit for the sanctity of motherhood,” she was cast out to the BarrenLands. But Mara’s spirit was not broken. She found refuge among the Hysterectom'ites, where her anger became a weapon. Her story spread, and she became a symbol of rebellion. The scarred man she blinded would later lead a campaign to wipe out the resistance—his rage driving him to even greater cruelty.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>3. Talia’s Silent Song</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> 13<br>\n<strong>Story:</strong><br>\nTalia was known for her voice—a beautiful, haunting soprano that brought a rare sense of peace to her desolate community. She sang to soothe her younger siblings, to bring hope to her mother, who worked herself to exhaustion in the textile factories. Her voice was her gift, her light.</p>\n<p>When her time came, the Iron Choir arrived with a deafening announcement: Talia had been selected for her “holy duty.” Her mother begged them to leave her daughter, clutching her tightly. “Take me instead,” she pleaded. But the guards only laughed, dragging Talia away as her siblings screamed.</p>\n<p>At The Farm, Talia sang in her cell, her voice carrying through the cold, sterile halls. Even the guards paused to listen, though they quickly silenced her with threats. “Your voice belongs to the regime,” they snarled.</p>\n<p>Her first test ended in failure—her frail body rejecting the invasive attempts to “fulfill her duty.” Deemed a heretic, she was sentenced to death. On the day of her execution, she was marched to the gallows. A crowd gathered to watch, but Talia stood tall. Before they could tighten the noose, she began to sing.</p>\n<p>Her voice soared, silencing the crowd. For a moment, the bleakness lifted, and tears fell from the faces of those who listened. Even the guards hesitated, awed by her defiance. But the Priest of Policy, enraged, gave the order. Her song was cut short as the noose tightened.</p>\n<p>In death, Talia’s silent song became a rallying cry. Her name was whispered among the resistance, and her story lived on as a testament to the power of hope in the face of despair.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3><strong>4. Reyna’s Last Step</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> 12<br>\n<strong>Story:</strong><br>\nReyna dreamed of running. She loved the wind in her hair, the pounding of her feet against the dirt paths of District 7. It was her escape, her freedom. But freedom was fleeting.</p>\n<p>When the Iron Choir came for her, she tried to run. Her small legs carried her farther than anyone expected, weaving through alleys and leaping over fences. But they caught her, dragging her back in chains. “You can’t outrun duty,” they sneered.</p>\n<p>At The Farm, Reyna was defiant. She refused to eat, to comply, to kneel during the sermons. She found solace in pacing her cell, imagining she was running through open fields. Her first test was violent—an older man who reveled in breaking “wild” girls like her. When she resisted, they beat her. Still, she fought.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the regime broke her body but not her spirit. When she could no longer run, Reyna made a final act of defiance. During a public parade celebrating Fertility Day, she dragged herself from the crowd and threw herself at the Priest of Policy’s carriage, screaming for freedom. She was struck down instantly, but her last step became a symbol of resistance.</p>\n<p>The Hysterectom'ites honored her memory with the phrase: “Run, Reyna, Run,” a mantra for their fight against tyranny.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Each story deepens the emotional weight of the narrative while highlighting the inhumanity of the regime and the resilience of the resistance.

            "content": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a file named \"03-02-2025-PDF Pals.png\" with the content of a mathematical expression: 1 + 1/2 - 1/3. The task is to consolidate and improve the overall prompt for the end output being analyzed, focusing on prompt info, output, and settings based on the previous interactions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The previous interactions were about optimizing YouTube SEO prompts, creating titles, descriptions, tags, and typography for videos discussing the New Apostolic Reformation and Dominionism. Now, there's a mathematical expression here. But the user mentioned that the ONLY end output is to consolidate and improve the overall PROMPT related to analyzing transcripts and content. However, the provided file content is a math equation, which seems unrelated to the previous topic. This might be a test or a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the user wants to see if I can handle unexpected content and still apply the previous framework. The key is to maintain the structure of consolidating prompts but adapt it to the new content type, which is a mathematical equation here. The previous prompts were for YouTube SEO, but now it's about a PDF with a math problem. The user might want a prompt that generates educational content, perhaps explaining the equation step-by-step, creating SEO-friendly titles and descriptions for a math tutorial video or PDF guide. \n\nSo, I need to adjust the previous SEO prompts to fit an educational context. For example, instead of titles about religious movements, create titles about solving math problems. The bullet points would explain steps in solving the equation. Tags would relate to math education, fractions, arithmetic, etc. The typography prompt might focus on creating a vibrant, educational cover image for the PDF. \n\nI should structure the new prompts similarly to the previous ones but tailored to educational content. Ensure the titles are catchy, use relevant emojis (like 🧮, ➗, 📚), optimize for keywords like \"math tutorial,\" \"fraction addition,\" \"step-by-step guide,\" etc. The description should include a summary of the problem, bullet points of steps, and a call to action. Tags should include relevant hashtags. \n\nAlso, considering the mathematical expression provided (1 + 1/2 - 1/3), the solution involves finding a common denominator, performing the arithmetic, and simplifying. The prompt should guide the creation of content that explains this process clearly, perhaps with timestamps for different sections of a video tutorial. \n\nNeed to check if there's any specific instruction I missed. The user mentioned that the ONLY end output is to consolidate and improve the prompt based on analyzing the transcript and content. So, even though the content is a math problem, the goal is to create a prompt that would generate SEO-optimized content for this math problem, similar to how it was done for the previous religious movement topic. \n\nTherefore, the consolidated prompt should include elements like title generation with emojis and keywords, a detailed description with bullet points explaining the steps, tags related to math education, and perhaps a typography prompt for creating an engaging PDF cover. The previous structure had different sections for different platforms (Shorts, long-form), so this should be adapted here as well. \n\nI need to make sure that all components from the previous prompts are translated appropriately. For example, the \"dark and moody\" style might not fit here, but a \"vibrant and educational\" style would. The engagement bait could be questions like \"Can you solve this?\" or \"Test your math skills!\". \n\nFinally, the example output should demonstrate how the prompt would generate titles, descriptions, tags, and maybe a typography design for the math problem. Ensuring that the mathematical accuracy is maintained in the example is crucial. \n\nLet me structure this step-by-step to cover all necessary aspects without missing any components from the original prompts."
