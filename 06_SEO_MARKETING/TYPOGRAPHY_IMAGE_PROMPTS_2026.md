```
A striking typography-focused cover design against a dark gradient background transitioning from deep navy (#0a1628) to charcoal black.

The typography features:
- Primary text in bold 3D metallic silver with edge lighting from the left

- Circuit board traces weaving behind the text like digital veins
- Scales of justice silhouette positioned lower right, partially obscured
- Gavel shadow cast across bottom third of composition

Decorative elements:
- Thin horizontal lines flanking the main text like redacted document marks
- Small lightning bolt icons near "SCANDALS" suggesting controversy
- Binary code fragments (01001) fading into the gradient edges
