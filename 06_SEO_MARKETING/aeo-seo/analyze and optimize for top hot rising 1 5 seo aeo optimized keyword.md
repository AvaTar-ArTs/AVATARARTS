Your track references **five distinct plant medicine traditions**, giving it remarkable keyword coverage:

**User:** engaging entertaining trendy song title

---

**Assistant:** Here are some engaging, trendy title ideas that still fit the medicine/ceremony vibe:
- Shadows Purge (Medicine for the Night)
- Shadows Purge: A Plant Medicine Trip
- Shadows Purge: Ego Death & Rebirth
- Shadows Purge in the Spirit Sky
- Shadows Purge: Songs for Ceremony
- Shadows Purge: Ancestral Night Vision
- Shadows Purge: Dark Icaros for Healing
If you tell what platforms you’re prioritizing (Spotify, YouTube, TikTok), a version can be tuned specifically for clickability there.

**User:** i use distrokid so everywhere

---

**Assistant:** Got it—since DistroKid pushes to everything, the title needs to be short, clickable, and platform-agnostic (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TikTok, etc.) while still feeding the medicine/ceremony niche.
Here are focused, everywhere-safe options built from your theme:
- Shadows Purge
- Shadows Purge: Medicine Music
- Shadows Purge: Plant Medicine Journey
- Shadows Purge: Ego Death & Healing
- Shadows Purge: Shamanic Ceremony
These all stay within normal store formatting rules (parentheses or subtitles are allowed, but avoid stacking too much version info in the title field).

**User:** about that. i have a ‘personal’ spotify AND my Artist name/page is AvaTarArTs / or should i use my real name Steven Chaplinski as the artist

---

**Assistant:** Use **AvaTarArTs** as the public artist name, and keep **Steven Chaplinski** as your behind‑the‑scenes legal/songwriter identity.
## Name choice: real vs alias
- Streaming platforms pull the **artist name from your distributor metadata**, so whatever you set in DistroKid becomes the visible artist on Spotify/Apple/etc.
- Using an alias/stage name is totally normal; many artists release under an alias while keeping their real name for PROs, contracts, and legal credit, which simplifies royalty proof and paperwork.
## When an alias is better
- If the real name is long, hard to spell, or not very “brandable,” forums and artist branding discussions generally recommend using a clear, memorable alias instead.
- Music marketing communities warn that name collisions on Spotify (other artists with the same legal name) create search confusion and profile mix‑ups, so a distinctive alias tends to be safer long‑term.
## How to structure your setup
- Set **AvaTarArTs** as the **Artist** in DistroKid for this project, so all DSPs show that as the main name.
- Register songs with your PRO (ASCAP/BMI etc.) under **Steven Chaplinski** as the **songwriter/composer**, while still assigning the recordings to the artist alias.
- If you ever want to change the visible artist name later, DistroKid can request a name change and redeliver metadata so Spotify merges under the updated artist name instead of starting over.
If you tell what genres you want under your legal name (if any), a split strategy can be mapped: e.g., AvaTarArTs for ritual/medicine/AI‑driven work, Steven Chaplinski for more “composer/producer” catalog.

**User:** another aspect is my Large Collection of original songs in various covers/styles. is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZbP69fy3h5uJpkjaPFuO82IzwvUu6DHcd9Bfe5apYs/edit?usp=drivesdk

---

**Assistant:** Short version: that spreadsheet is gold. It gives you everything needed to turn your Suno catalog into a structured release machine across DistroKid (and beyond) instead of random one‑offs.
## What this catalog represents
- You already have a themed micro‑universe: alleys, junkyards, raccoons, heartbreak, witch roads, ancestors, etc., with multiple remastered versions and styles per song.
- Each row has what distributors and algorithms care about: title, length, style, “vibe” descriptors, and lyrics hooks that can be turned into SEO tags and playlists.
## How to use it strategically
- Group songs into “worlds” or EPs:  
  - Alley/Raccoon universe (Echoes of Moonlight, in This Alley Where I Hide, Kings and Queens of Litter, Love is rubbish Let’s Get Trashy).  
  - Junkyard/Recycled/Symphony universe (Junkyard Symphony, Recycled Symphony, etc.).  
  - Heartbreak/Memory/Emotional universe (Heartbreak Hope and Memories, Echoes of Yesterday, Heartbeats in the Dark).  
  - Mystic/Ancestral universe (The Sound of Ancestors, Witches Road).  
  This mirrors how multi‑genre producers split projects into distinct brands so fans know what they’re getting.
- Decide what becomes “official canon” for DSPs: for each song with multiple “Remastered / 2 / 2.1” versions, pick:  
  - 1 definitive audio master (usually best overall feel, or shortest clean version for playlists).  
  - 1 clean, human‑readable title (e.g., “Love Is Rubbish (Let’s Get Trashy)” instead of internal v4 naming).  
  Distribution guides recommend avoiding version codes in public titles; use them only in your internal sheet.
## How it ties back to your artist name
- Use this sheet as the master map for what goes out under AvaTarArTs vs any future side alias. You can add a column “Release Project/World” and “Artist Brand” to keep your catalog segmented even if it all starts from the same spreadsheet.
- When you move into medicine music as AvaTarArTs, this older alley/junkyard universe can either:  
  - Stay as a separate “grit‑folk” world under the same alias, or  
  - Be spun off later as a side project if the ceremony catalog needs a cleaner brand split.
If you want, the next step can be: turn this sheet into a concrete release plan—EP names, tracklists, and which 3–5 songs to prioritize first for DistroKid.

**Assistant:** You basically have a full-blown catalog database here – this sheet is perfect as the “source of truth” for planning what to release, in what order, and under which project.
Here’s the key way to think about it:
- Each “song family” = 1 core composition with multiple versions: short Suno cuts, remixes, remasters, different arrangements (e.g., “No More Love Songs,” “in This aLLey Where i HiDe,” “Love is rubbish / Trashy,” “Junkyard / Recycled Symphony,” “The Sound of Ancestors,” “Heroes Rise – Villains Overthrow,” “Witches Road,” etc.).
- The columns you already have (SongTitle, Genre, Time, Origin Date, SongURL, Playlist, Plays, Version) give you everything needed to:  
  - Pick 1 “canonical” version for DSPs (best length/feel, usually 2:30–3:30).  
  - Group songs into EPs/“worlds” (Alley/Junkyard universe, Ancestors/Medicine/mystic, Heroes/Villains anime‑grit, etc.).  
  - See which ideas already show traction (plays) to decide what to prioritize first.
If you want, next step can be: “give me a concrete first‑wave release plan from this sheet: 3 EPs + tracklists + final cleaned-up titles,” and this can be mapped directly from the rows you pasted.

**Assistant:** Short answer: yes, you can absolutely merge both sheets into one sorted CSV, but it has to be done from your side since those Google Sheets aren’t directly readable here.
Here’s the simplest way to do it:
1) Export both sheets from Google Sheets  
- Open each link.  
- File → Download → “Comma-separated values (.csv)”.  
- You’ll get two files, e.g.  
  - Suno-ScrapeD.csv  
  - Suno Master-0ct2025.csv
2) Make their column headers match  
- In a spreadsheet app (Excel, LibreOffice, or Google Sheets), make sure both files share a common set of columns, for example:  
  - SongTitle  
  - Genre  
  - Time  
  - Origin Date  
  - CoverUrl  
  - SongURL  
  - Playlist  
  - Plays  
  - Lyrics  
  - Version  
- If one file uses slightly different header names, rename them to match (e.g. “songName” → “SongTitle”, “songLink” → “SongURL”, etc.).
3) Combine them into one CSV (no coding)  
- Create a new blank Google Sheet.  
- Import the first CSV (File → Import → Upload → Insert new sheet).  
- Import the second CSV into the same document (again Insert new sheet).  
- In a third sheet, use:  
  - ={'Sheet1'!A1:J; 'Sheet2'!A2:J}  
  This stacks Sheet2 under Sheet1 while keeping only one header row.  
- Sort by whatever you want (e.g. SongTitle or Origin Date).  
- Then File → Download → CSV to get your unified file.
4) Or, if you want to use Python locally  
- Once both CSVs are downloaded and headers aligned, run something like:
  - Read both CSVs.  
  - Concatenate them.  
  - Drop duplicates by SongTitle + SongURL + Version.  
  - Save as merged_suno_catalog.csv.
If you tell which column you want as the primary sort key (Title, Date, Plays, etc.), a ready-to-paste formula/layout for the master sheet can be given next.
