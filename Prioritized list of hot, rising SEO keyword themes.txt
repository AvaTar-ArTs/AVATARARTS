Prioritized list of hot, rising SEO keyword themes in AI/tech (the true “top 1–5%” signals), why they’re rising, search intent, content angles that win, example long‑tail keywords, and quick difficulty/priority recommendations. I also give a short 90‑day playbook and the exact tools/metrics to validate and scale.

Notes on methodology
・	I synthesized industry signals (research papers, dev communities, product launches, regulatory activity, creator-platform trends) and typical SERP behavior post‑2022.
・	For live validation & exact volumes use tools: Google Trends, Ahrefs/SEMrush/Moz, Google Keyword Planner, GA4 + Search Console. I haven’t pulled live tool data in this response — I can if you want a tool export.

・	Run keyword volume + difficulty checks in Ahrefs/SEMrush.
・	Map target keywords to intent and domain pages.
・	Do SERP intent analysis (features: people also ask, video, news, shopping, images).
・	Week 3–6: Pillar + cluster content
・	Create 3 pillar pages (e.g., “AI Copilot Guide”, “LLMOps & Observability”, “Generative AI Tools for Creators”).
・	Publish 6–9 cluster posts (practical how‑tos, comparisons, case studies).
・	Optimize meta titles, descriptions, schema (Article, FAQ, HowTo).
・	Week 7–12: Technical & growth
・	Improve site speed and Core Web Vitals.
・	Add structured data (FAQ, HowTo, Organization, Product).
・	Outreach: publish 2 research/case partnerships, get 10–15 high-authority backlinks.
・	Convert high-intent content into lead magnets (templates, checklists, demos).
・	Ongoing: Measure & iterate
・	Track rankings, clicks, CTR and conversion with Search Console + GA4.
・	A/B test meta titles and CTAs; repurpose high-engagement posts into video/audio.

SEO & content tactics that perform for these topics
・	E-E-A-T: author bios with publications, code repos, paper links — critical for AI trust.
・	Include reproducible demos and GitHub repos to boost links & technical authority.
・	Use data/benchmarks in posts — original charts drive links and shares.
・	Target SERP features: FAQs, How-To snippets, code blocks, interactive notebooks.
・	Prioritize long-tail intent content for conversions (e.g., “how to deploy X in production”).
・	Internal linking: pillar → cluster → case study → demo to funnel authority.

Must‑use tools & KPIs to validate trends
・	Tools: Google Trends, Ahrefs/SEMrush (keyword volumes, SERP features), Google Keyword Planner, GSC, GA4, BuzzSumo (content virality), Feed/Reddit/StackOverflow signals (developer interest).
・	KPIs: organic clicks, impressions, average position, CTR, conversion (signups/demo requests), backlinks, time on page, engagement.

Deliverables I can prepare next (pick one)
・	Full keyword list (200 keywords) with volumes, KD, intent, and mapped URLs. (Requires access to Ahrefs/SEMrush output)
・	3 SEO content briefs (titles, H2 outline, meta, CTAs) for high-priority pillars.
