Hourly  - Expert  -Est. Time: Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week

I need a couple of lifestyle images created of a white male athletic, good looking, muscular, but not bodybuilder muscular basketball player wearing our product. The product is knee pads, sometimes called padded knee sleeves. The product fit should be: from just above the knee and falls just above the bottom of calf. The images need to look "real", and not ai generated. The clothing player is wearing should not have any logos from other companies. I have attached multiple images of product for you to choose from. The product displayed in images you create should look identical to the products in image in regards to color and pad shape. The model can be shooting the basketball, or standing with a basketball. I will leave this up to you. I will need multiple images but for this job just provide me with 1 or 2 so I can see what you are capable of creating and how long this takes you. If you have questions please ask. I would like this job completed today.

Hourly  - Expert  -Est. Time: More than 6 months, 30+ hrs/week

We are a premium supplements brand hiring one AI-first content creator for long-term work. This is a video-first role: images and UGC editing are also required. You will build and maintain a high-quality content library for paid ads (Meta, TikTok), Amazon listings (PDP/A+), Shopify product pages, email and landing pages. This is commercial, conversion-focused content, not experimental AI art. What you'll create: - AI-generated short-form video ads (15-45s) - Product & lifestyle visuals with realistic humans - Motion assets for PDPs and marketplaces - Static images when needed for PDPs, Amazon and ads - Editing and repurposing existing UGC videos (cropping, pacing, polishing) Initial focus: build a structured library of ad-ready videos and visuals. Afterwards: bi-weekly ad refreshes, iteration on winning ad angles, and ongoing PDP and marketplace creative. Required: - AI video generation using tools like Sora, Veo, Runway, Kling, Pika or similar - Ability to generate realistic human subjects without uncanny artefacts - Experience creating commercial/ad content - AI image generation (Midjourney, Flux, Nano Banana etc.) - Editing existing videos/UGC for ads and product pages Preferred: experience in supplements, wellness, beauty or consumer products. We care about visuals that feel natural, human, calm, premium and believable. No gimmicky motion, lighting or cartoon aesthetics. Applications without relevant samples will be ignored. Include links to AI video work that features humans and resembles commercial ads, any work related to supplements, wellness, beauty or consumer products, the AI video tools you actively use, typical turnaround time, and availability. Optional: a short AI video you believe fits a premium supplements brand. If you want consistent work, high standards and long-term collaboration, and take AI video seriously, apply with your best work.

We currently work with our own prompts, but we run into limitations.

We are looking for someone who already has a fast and reliable workflow to solve this. The goal is speed and accuracy. Per product we need 2 model images, 3 detail images and 1 studio image per variant (maximum 5 variants). All images must use the same background color: #f2f2f2, and be visually consistent across the full product listing. This role is only suitable for someone who can generate multiple complete products per hour and who understands how to closely match AI images to real product details. Please apply only if you have a proven solution and can show relevant examples.

Save job Virtual Assistant / AI, Automation & Content

Hourly: $22-$29  - Intermediate  -Est. Time: More than 6 months, not_sure

Looking for a reliable, proactive VA who is comfortable leveraging AI and eager to learn more. I'm solopreneur who needs help with automation, content editing/creating/repurposing, and light project management. Focus on efficiency and reducing manual work. As some of the initial tasks are completely, there will be an increase in projects and workload, which you will have the option to take on if interested. Key tasks and automations needed: Set up and maintain Zapier automations (webhooks, Drive/Sheets sync, AI tool chaining). Repurpose long-form content into shorts/clips (using Opus Clip, CapCut, or similar). Create/optimize YouTube descriptions, titles, tags, hashtags, thumbnails. Manage Google Sheets for task tracking and project roadmaps. Basic research (tools, trends, best practices) and summarize findings. Handle simple admin (file organization, scheduling reminders). Required Core Skillsets Strong in at least 2–3 of these (must have Zapier experience): Zapier / Make.com automation (webhooks, multi-step flows). AI prompting (Claude, Grok, Gemini) for content/scripts/summaries. Video editing (CapCut preferred, basic cuts/trim/captions). Content repurposing (Opus Clip or similar for shorts). Google Workspace (Sheets, Drive, Docs) organization. YouTube optimization (titles, descriptions, tags, SEO basics). Nice-to-have (can learn on the job): Familiarity with ElevenLabs/HeyGen for AI voice/avatar workflows. Basic graphic design (thumbnails via Canva or CapCut). Voice note transcription tools. Our System Preferences We use a lean stack (no bloated subscriptions): Zapier (already active). Google Workspace (Sheets/Drive). CapCut (free tier + potential paid). Opus Clip. ElevenLabs/HeyGen (low-tier plans). Claude/Grok/Gemini for prompting. Open to adding 1–2 new tools if they clearly save time, but prefer avoiding complex/expensive subscriptions. Rate & Hours $15–22/hour (depending on proven Zapier/AI experience). 10–20 hours/week to start (flexible, async). Paid via Upwork (weekly or bi-weekly). 1-week paid trial to test fit. To Apply Reply with: Your hourly rate. Link to Upwork profile or examples of Zapier flows/AI prompting work. Short note: Why this role fits your strengths. Availability (hours/week). Looking for long-term fit — someone who thinks ahead and suggests improvements.

Hi there, I’m looking for an experienced AI Video Creator using tools like Google Veo 3, HeyGen, or Nano Banana to help me create short-form and YouTube-style videos for a platform I’m building called The Build Bridge. The Build Bridge connects homeowners and investors with vetted trades and contractors. It’s not a directory or pay-per-lead platform; projects and trades are qualified first, and matches are intentional. The goal of the videos is to build trust, explain the concept clearly, and attract both clients and trades. In addition to founder-led content, I’m looking to introduce a male on-screen business partner with a construction background to help balance perspectives and boost credibility with certain audiences. This role is strictly for on-camera presence and messaging support. I’m looking to create: Short explainer videos (30–60 seconds) Instagram / Facebook Reels that catch attention YouTube-style videos (2–5 minutes) Founder-led, partner-led, or voiceover-based content Clean, professional visuals (not flashy or gimmicky) I’ll provide messaging direction and brand tone; I’m looking for help with AI video creation, visuals, and editing. If this aligns with your experience, I’d love to hear: Which tools you specialize in Examples of similar work Your recommended workflow and availability Thanks, Emma Founder, The Build Bridge

I am looking for someone who can create and source many images to be used on my website. I require different types of images such as ones of work vans and vehicles with my branding on them, workers with t shirts with my branding on them and also images of examples of the type of work we do. We are a decorating company. How you generate the images is completely up to you wether it's completely AI generated or if you source real images to then apply my branding whichever will provide the best and most realistic outcome. I'm looking for someone who is able to create extremely realistic looking images, I can currently create images myself which look good but I am looking for someone who has a greater ability than myself to make images which are even more realistic looking. I've attached an example of one image I have made myself. I am looking for images in this sort of style. I need around 30+ images in total.

Fixed-price  - Expert  -Est. Budget:  $100

We are seeking an experienced Discord bot developer to create a system that detects duplicate images, tracks posting volume, and manages worker assignments across channels. The bot must identify duplicate content even if images are reposted as screenshots, resized, or edited. It should count images per channel, enforce limits, and support reset logic. Key features include perceptual image duplicate detection using pHash, dHash, aHash, or blockhash, and storing image hashes in a database for real-time comparison. The system should also assign workers to specific channels and restrict posting to assigned users. Admin commands for stats, resets, and assignments are required, along with logging to an admin channel.

Context: We are a content agency that is looking for help building an automation that will help us with prospecting. How the automation must work: Step 1: We enter LinkedIn profile URLs and email addresses of a prospect into a spreadsheet row (Airtable, Sheets, etc.) Step 2: The automation prompts an LLM to do basic research on the company, the prospect, etc. Step 3: The automation duplicates a template Google Doc we have. Step 4: Using the research completed in Step 2, and referencing our internal writing document, the automation fills relevant information into the right part of the Google Doc. Step 5: The automation invites the prospect’s email as a viewer on the document.
