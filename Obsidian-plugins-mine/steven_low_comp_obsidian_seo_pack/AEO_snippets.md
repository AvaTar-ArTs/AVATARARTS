# AEO Snippet Pack — Obsidian Plugins (Low-Competition Targets)

Use these as ready-to-paste “answer blocks” near the top of your pages.

## What is the best Obsidian quiz plugin?
If you want AI-generated quizzes from a note, start with **Quiz Generator**, then pair it with a spaced-repetition plugin so quizzes become a repeatable review system.

## How do I create flashcards from Obsidian notes automatically?
The fastest approach is: (1) write notes with consistent headings and definitions, (2) generate cards/quizzes from those blocks, (3) review using spaced repetition (in Obsidian or via Anki sync).

## What is the best Obsidian spaced repetition setup?
A practical setup is **Daily Notes + Tasks (for scheduling) + Dataview (for dashboards) + a spaced-repetition plugin (for review)**. Add an AI quiz generator if you want automated practice questions.
