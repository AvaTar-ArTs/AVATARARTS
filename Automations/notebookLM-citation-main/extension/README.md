# NotebookLM Citation Mapper

A Chrome extension that preserves citation references when copying chat text from Google NotebookLM.

## Overview

When you copy text from NotebookLM's chat interface, the citation numbers (like [1], [2], etc.) are included, but without context about which sources they refer to. This extension automatically maps those citation numbers to their corresponding source filenames, making your copied text complete and useful.

## Features

- **Automatic Citation Mapping**: Automatically detects and maps citation numbers to source document names
- **Copy with Sources**: Copy chat text with citation sources appended at the bottom
- **Draggable Legend Window**: Shows a real-time citation map directly on the NotebookLM page
- **Smart Citation Expansion**: Automatically expands hidden citation lists to capture all sources
- **Popup Interface**: Quick access to citation mappings and controls
- **Auto-Rescan**: Monitors page changes and updates mappings automatically
- **Customizable Formatting**: Configure how citations and sources appear in copied text
- **Export/Import**: Save and restore citation mappings
- **Statistics & History**: Track your citation usage and copy history
- **Theme Support**: Light, dark, and auto themes available

## How It Works

1. The extension injects a content script into NotebookLM pages
2. It scans the page for citation references and source documents
3. A mapping is created between citation numbers and source filenames
4. When you copy text, the extension adds the source list at the bottom
5. The mapping updates automatically as you interact with NotebookLM
