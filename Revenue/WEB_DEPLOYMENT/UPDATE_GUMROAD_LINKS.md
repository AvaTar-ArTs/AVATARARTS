- Or: `https://gumroad.com/l/product-name`

**Copy these links!**

### Step 2: Edit index.html

2. Find each placeholder link
3. Replace with your real Gumroad link
4. Save file

### Step 3: Re-upload

Publish the updated `products/index.html` to your website (using your preferred deployment method), then test that the links work.
