# Web Deployment - Trend Pulse / SEO-revenue Static Site

This folder contains a ready-to-publish **static site** (HTML pages) that documents and showcases the Trend Pulse ecosystem.

## ✅ What this is
- **Static HTML pages** (no backend required)
- A **products** page (`products/index.html`) that links to Gumroad listings
- Navigation pages: `index.html`, `docs.html`, `monetization.html`, `expansion-packs.html`, `n8n-workflows.html`, `sitemap.html`

## 🎯 What you do (simple workflow)
1. **Create Gumroad listings** (or confirm the links you want to use)
2. **Update links** in `products/index.html`
3. **Publish the HTML files** to your website so they live under a path like:
   - `/SEO-revenue/`

## 🧭 Files that matter
- `products/index.html`: the page you will edit most (Gumroad links)
- `index.html`: the landing page
- `docs.html`, `monetization.html`, `expansion-packs.html`, `n8n-workflows.html`, `sitemap.html`: navigation/support pages
