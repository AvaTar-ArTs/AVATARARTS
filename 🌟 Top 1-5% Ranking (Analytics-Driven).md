🛠️ Next Steps for Validation & Implementation



1. Verify Growth Metrics: Use the free keyword research tool from Exploding Topics (powered by Semrush) to input the seed keyword “SEO revenue” and generate a list of related, trending keywords with actual volume and trend data.
2. Analyze Search Intent: For each shortlisted keyword, examine the search results page (SERP) to determine if the intent is informational, commercial, or transactional. Format your content accordingly—especially for AEO, where providing a direct answer upfront is key.
3. Implement AEO Best Practices:

  · Structure for Answers: Format content using clear Q&A sections (H2/H3 headings followed by concise 40-60 word answers).

  · Use Schema Markup: Implement FAQPage, HowTo, or Article schema to help answer engines parse and feature your content.

  · Target “People Also Ask”: Use these questions as a direct source for keyword and content ideas.

4. Monitor Performance: Track rankings for these keywords, but also monitor AEO-specific metrics like featured snippet appearances and impressions from zero-click searches.



By focusing on these trend-aligned keywords and combining solid SEO fundamentals with AEO strategies, you can create content that captures both immediate traffic and positions you for the future of search.
