⏺ Let me check your current NotebookLM authentication status first.

⏺ You're already authenticated with NotebookLM.

  Current Status:
  - Authenticated: Yes ✓

  - Last auth: Today at 01:36:24

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Your NotebookLM session persists browser cookies in ~/.claude/skills/notebooklm/data/browser_state/. This means you won't need to log in again until Google expires the session (typically weeks).
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  You're ready to use NotebookLM. Here are some quick commands:

  # List your notebooks
  python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list

  # Ask a question (uses active notebook)
  python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "Your question here"

  # Query a specific notebook URL
  python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-url "https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/..."

  Would you like to:
  1. List your current notebooks to see what's available?
  2. Add a new notebook to your library?
  3. Ask a question to one of your notebooks?

    marketing, education, gemini, digital-empire
  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The [ACTIVE] notebook is your default - any question without --notebook-id or --notebook-url will query this one automatically. Uses: 0 means you haven't queried it yet through this skill.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Ready to query! Since you have an active notebook, you can ask questions directly:

  python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "What are the key strategies for AI automation?"

  Would you like to:
  1. Ask a question to your NotebookLM Automation Manual?
  2. Add another notebook to your library?

❯ 2 

⏺ To add a notebook, I'll need the NotebookLM URL.

  Please share the notebook URL - it looks like:
  https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/abc123...

  Once you provide it, I'll use Smart Discovery to:
  1. Query the notebook to understand its content
  2. Auto-generate an appropriate name, description, and topics
  3. Add it to your library with accurate metadata

❯ here https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/b32a64ba-e77d-445c-b301-c7b9b

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Smart Discovery queried each notebook to extract accurate metadata rather than guessing. This ensures topic-based searches (notebook_manager.py search --query "aeo") return relevant results. The two new notebooks complement each other: Blueprint = strategy & architecture, Operations = execution & infrastructure.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Quick Reference:
  # Query the Blueprint (strategy questions)
  python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-id digital-empire-blueprint-2025

  # Query Operations Manual (execution questions)  
  python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-id digital-empire-operations-manual

  # Set one as active default
  python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py activate --id digital-empire-operations-manual

  ---

  Design a striking typography cover image with the text ‘Elon Musk: Social 
  Security Scandals & Legal Battles’ prominently displayed. The typography  
  should exude a modern, tech-inspired aesthetic, featuring sleek,          
  futuristic fonts intertwined with subtle elements like circuit patterns   
  and legal motifs (e.g., gavel, scales of justice). Incorporate a color    
  scheme of deep blues and metallic silvers to convey professionalism and   
  gravity. The background should be a dark gradient with faint imagery of   
  Social Security cards and legal documents, symbolizing the intertwining   
  themes of technology and legal scrutiny. Ensure the composition balances  
  the boldness of the text with the subtlety of the background elements,    
  creating an image that is both engaging and informative.”                 
                                                                            
  Design Tips:                                                              
  • Typography: Choose a font that reflects a tech-savvy and authoritative  
  tone. Consider using a sans-serif typeface with clean lines and a slight  
  futuristic flair.                                                         
  • Color Palette: Deep blues and metallic silvers can evoke a sense of     
  trust and modernity. Use gradients to add depth and dimension to the      
  background.                                                               
  • Imagery: Subtly integrate elements like circuit patterns to represent   
  technology, and legal symbols such as a gavel or scales to signify the    
  legal challenges. Ensure these elements are understated so as not to      
  overpower the typography.                                                 
  • Composition: Center the text prominently, with background elements      
  providing context without distraction. Use layering effects to create a   
  sense of depth.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Your NotebookLM strategy recommends the 24-48 hour window for trend capitalization. The "very-low" competition keywords like Tater Tot Cat (+340%) and Lancashire Heeler (+175%) are prime "blue ocean" opportunities where you can dominate before saturation.
