## Suno - Boston/NYC

Dear Suno Growth Team,

Here's a growth metric you might find interesting: **I've generated 783 songs on your platform.**

Not 10. Not 50. **783.**

That's not just usage?that's obsession. And obsession driven by growth features that work:

? **Remaster** - Made me regenerate 100+ tracks to improve quality  
? **Remix** - Caused me to create variations of my best songs  
? **Extend** - Turned 2-min clips into full 4-min songs  
? **Tag System** - Helped me discover new styles and iterate  

I didn't just experience your growth features?I can quantify their impact on my behavior.

P.S. - Want to know what would make me generate song #784 today? Better library organization tools. Want to know what would make me upgrade to a higher tier? Bulk operations. Want to know what would make me invite friends? Collaboration features. I have 783 ideas because I've generated 783 songs. Let's ship them. ??
