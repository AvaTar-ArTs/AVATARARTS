From auditing invoices and preparing customs filings to syncing information across systems, we empower operators to work more efficiently and accurately. The impact? Faster service, fewer errors, and more time for businesses to focus on growth and customer service.We're fortunate to have the support of top investors who are just as passionate as we do about transforming the industry, including Eight Roads (Alibaba, Spendesk, Toast), Bessemer Venture Partners (LinkedIn, Twilio, Shopify), Episode 1 (Zoopla, Betfair, Shazam), and Dynamo Ventures (Sennder, Stord, Gatik).We're looking for a product marketer who is a great storyteller, can transform complex ideas into clear, compelling narratives, and understands how to translate value into a strategic positioning.

Storytelling: Transform complex product features into engaging narratives that connect with customers and drive demand. Go-to-Market Strategy: Lead and execute GTM strategies for new product launches, ensuring cross-functional alignment. Sales Enablement: Create sales collateral, presentations, and training materials to equip the sales team with the right messaging and tools. Market & Customer Insights: Conduct market research, analyze customer needs, and track industry trends to inform positioning and strategy. Competitive Analysis: Monitor competitors and craft strategies to highlight our advantages. Content & Demand Generation: Collaborate with content, growth, and brand teams to develop campaigns, case studies, and thought leadershipWe specifically want someone who has:Past experience in product marketing in scale ups, strong passion and grit to win big timeExcellent written and verbal communication skills - there is a heavy amount of writing and presenting/selling ideas in this roleStrong leadership and communication skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and influence stakeholders at all levelsPrefer working in a fast-paced, collaborative capacity.
