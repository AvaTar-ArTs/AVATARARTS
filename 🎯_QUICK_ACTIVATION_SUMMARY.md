## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (Why No Revenue Yet)

1. **❌ Not on marketplaces** — Products exist but CodeCanyon/Gumroad = empty
2. **❌ No email list** — 100 contacts vs potential 10,000+
3. **❌ No paid ads** — Relying on organic only (slow)
4. **❌ No bundles** — Selling individual items vs $297 bundles (3-5x less revenue)
5. **❌ No SaaS launch** — Retention Suite built but not marketed
