On the top part there's a manual chat node connected to a LangChain ReAct Agent. The agent has access to a workflow tool for getting page content. The page content extraction starts with converting query parameters into a JSON object. There are 3 pre-defined parameters: url** – an address of the page to fetch method** = full / simplified maxlimit** - maximum length for the final page. For longer pages an error message is returned back to the agent Page content fetching is a multistep process: An HTTP Request mode tries to get the page content. If the page content was successfuly retrieved, a series of post-processing begin: Extract HTML BODY; content Remove all unnecessary tags to recuce the page size Further eliminate external URLs and IMG scr values (based on the method query parameter) Remaining HTML is converted to Markdown, thus recuding the page lengh even more while preserving the basic page structure The remaining content is sent back to an Agent if it's not too long (maxlimit = 70000 by default, see CONFIG node). NB: You can isolate the HTTP Request part into a separate workflow. Check the Workflow Tool description, it guides the agent to provide a query string with several parameters instead of a JSON object.

2508,Generate SQL queries from schema only - AI-powered,"This workflow is a modification of the previous template on how to create an SQL agent with LangChain and SQLite. The key difference – the agent has access only to the database schema, not to the actual data. To achieve this, SQL queries are made outside the AI Agent node, and the results are never passed back to the agent. This approach allows the agent to generate SQL queries based on the structure of tables and their relationships, without having to access the actual data. This makes the process more secure and efficient, especially in cases where data confidentiality is crucial. 🚀 Setup To get started with this workflow, you’ll need to set up a free MySQL server and import your database (check Step 1 and 2 in this tutorial). Of course, you can switch MySQL to another SQL database such as PostgreSQL, the principle remains the same. The key is to download the schema once and save it locally to avoid repeated remote connections. Run the top part of the workflow once to download and store the MySQL chinook database schema file on the server. With this approach, we avoid the need to repeatedly connect to a remote db4free database and fetch the schema every time. As a result, we reach greater processing speed and efficiency. 🗣️ Chat with your data Start a chat: send a message in the chat window. The workflow loads the locally saved MySQL database schema, without having the ability to touch the actual data. The file contains the full structure of your MySQL database for analysis. The Langchain AI Agent receives the schema, your input and begins to work. The AI Agent generates SQL queries and brief comments based solely on the schema and the user’s message. An IF node checks whether the AI Agent has generated a query. When: Yes: the AI Agent passes the SQL query to the next MySQL node for execution. No: You get a direct answer from the Agent without further action. The workflow formats the results of the SQL query, ensuring they are convenient to read and easy to understand. Once formatted, you get both the Agent answer and the query result in the chat window. 🌟 Example queries Try these sample queries to see the schema-driven AI Agent in action: Would you please list me all customers from Germany? What are the music genres in the database? What tables are available in the database? Please describe the relationships between tables. - In this example, the AI Agent does not need to create the SQL query. And if you prefer to keep the data private, you can manually execute the generated SQL query in your own environment using any database client or tool you trust 🗄️ 💭 The AI Agent memory node does not store the actual data as we run SQL-queries outside the agent. It contains the database schema, user questions and the initial Agent reply. Actual SQL query results are passed to the chat window, but the values are not stored in the Agent memory.",38321,2024-10-29 21:14:34.146000+00:00,True,4

2917,Allow Users to Send a Sequence of Messages to an AI Agent in Telegram,"Use Case When creating chatbots that interface through applications such as Telegram and WhatsApp, users can often sends multiple shorter messages in quick succession, in place of a single, longer message. This workflow accounts for this behaviour. What it Does This workflow allows users to send several messages in quick succession, treating them as one coherent conversation instead of separate messages requiring individual responses. How it Works When messages arrive, they are stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL table The system waits briefly to see if additional messages arrive If no new messages arrive within the waiting period, all queued messages are: Combined and processed as a single conversation Responded to with one unified reply Deleted from the queue Setup Create a table in Supabase called message_queue. It needs to have the following columns: user_id (uint8), message (text), and message_id (uint8) Add your Telegram, Supabase, OpenAI, and PostgreSQL credentials Activate the workflow and test by sending multiple messages the Telegram bot in one go Wait ten seconds after which you will receive a single reply to all of your messages How to Modify it to Your Needs Change the value of Wait Amount in the Wait 10 Seconds node in order to to modify the buffering window Add a System Message to the AI Agent to tailor it to your specific use case Replace the OpenAI sub-node to use a different language model",12165,2025-02-16 12:03:51.655000+00:00,True,5

3123,Automatic Reminders For Follow-ups with AI and Human in the loop Gmail,"This n8n template extends the idea of follow-up reminders by having an AI agent suggest and book the next call or message to re-engage prospects which have been ignored. What makes this template particularly interesting and actually usable is that it uses the Human-in-the-loop approach to wait for a user's approval before actually making the booking or otherwise not if the user declined. A twist on a traditional idea where we can reduce the number of actionable tasks a human has to make by delegating them to AI. How it works A scheduled trigger checks your google calendar for sales meetings which happened a few days ago. For each event, gmail search is used to figure out if a follow-up message has been sent or received from the other party since the meeting. If none, it might mean the user needs a reminder to follow-up. For leads applicable for follow-up, we first get an AI Agent to find available meeting slots in the calendar. These slots and reminder are sent to the user via send-and-approval mode of the gmail node. The user replies in natural language either picking a slot, suggesting an entirely new slot or declines the request. When accepted, another AI Agent books the meeting in the calendar with the proposed dates and lead. When declined, no action is taken. How to use Update all calendar nodes (+subnodes) to point to the right calendar. If this is a shared-purpose calendar, you may need to either filter or create a new calendar. Update the gmail nodes to point to the right accounts. Requirements Google OAuth for Email and Calendar OpenAI for LLM Customising the template Not using Google? Swap out for Microsoft Outlook/Calendar or something else.

5589,Create a Multi-Modal Telegram Support Bot with GPT-4 and Supabase RAG,"🧠 What It Does This n8n workflow turns your Telegram bot into a smart, multi-modal AI assistant that accepts text, documents, images, and audio messages, interprets them using OpenAI models, and responds instantly with context-aware answers. It integrates a Supabase vector database to store document embeddings and retrieve relevant information before sending a prompt to OpenAI — enabling a full RAG experience 💡 Why This Workflow? Most support bots can only handle basic text input. This workflow: Supports multiple input formats (voice, documents, images, text) Dynamically extracts and processes data from uploaded files Implements RAG by combining user input with relevant memory or vector-based context Delivers more accurate, relevant, and human-like AI responses. 👤 Who It's For Businesses looking to automate support using Telegram Freelancers or solopreneurs offering AI Chatbots for businesses. Creators building AI-powered bots for real use cases as it's great for Customer support knowledge, Legal or Policy document, long FAQs, Project documentation, and Product information retrieval. Devs or analysts exploring AI + multi-format input + vector memory. ⚙️ How It Works 🗂️ Knowledge Base Setup Run the “Add to Supabase Vector DB” workflow manually to upload a document from your google drive and embed it into your vector database. This powers the Telegram chatbot’s ability to answer questions using your content. 🔁 Telegram Message Routing Telegram Trigger captures the user message (Text, Image, Voice, Document) Message Router routes input by type using a Switch node Each type is handled separately: Voice → Translate recording to text (.ogg, .mp3) Image → Analyze image to text. Text → Sent directly to AI Agent (.txt). Document → Parsed (e.g. .docx to .txt) accordingly. 📎 Document Type Routing Before routing documents by type, the Supported Document File Types node first checks if the file extension is allowed. If not supported, it exits early with an error message — preventing unnecessary processing. Supported documents are then routed using the Document Router node, and converted to text for further processing. Supported Document File Types .jpg .jpeg .png .webp .pdf .doc .docx .xls .xlsx .json .xml. The text content is combined with stored memory and embedded knowledge using a RAG approach, enabling the AI to respond based on real uploaded data. 🧠 RAG via Supabase Uploaded documents are vectorized using OpenAI Embeddings. Embeddings are stored in Supabase with metadata. On new questions, the chatbot: Extracts question intent Queries Supabase for semantically similar chunks Ranks retrieved chunks to find the most relevant match. Injects them into the prompt for OpenAI. OpenAI generates a grounded response based on actual document content. Response is sent to the Telegram user with content awareness. 🛠 How to Set It Up Open n8n or your local/self-hosted instance. Import the `.json ` workflow file.

If you've had trouble keeping up with the latest and greatest templates beign published daily, this workflow can save you a lot of time! How it works A scheduled trigger pulls a list of subscribers (email and category preferences) from an Excel workbook. We work out unique categories amongst all subscribers and only fetch the latest n8n website templates from these categories to save on resources and optimise the number of API calls we make. The fetched templates are summarised via AI to produce a short description which is more suitable for our email format.

2157,🤖 Advanced Slackbot with n8n,"Use case Slackbots are super powerful. At n8n, we have been using them to get a lot done.. But it can become hard to manage and maintain many different operations that a workflow can do. This is the base workflow we use for our most powerful internal Slackbots. They handle a lot from running e2e tests for Github branch to deleting a user. By splitting the workflow into many subworkflows, we are able to handle each command seperately, making it easier to debug as well as support new usecases. In this template, you can find eveything to setup your own Slackbot (and I made it simple, there's only one node to configure 😉). After that, you need to build your commands directly. This bot can create a new thread on an alerts channel and respond there. Or reply directly to the user. It responds for help request to return a help page. It automatically handles unknown commands. It also supports flags and environment variables. For example /cloudbot-test info mutasem --full-info -e env=prod would give you the following info, when calling subworkflow.

3363,Automated Interview Scheduling with GPT-4o and Google Calendar Chat Bot,"✨ Overview This workflow allows candidates to schedule interviews through a conversational AI assistant. It integrates with your Google Calendar to check for existing events and generates a list of available 30-minute weekday slots between 9 AM and 5 PM Eastern Time. Once the candidate selects a suitable time and provides their contact information, the AI bot automatically books the meeting on your calendar and confirms the appointment. ⚡ Prerequisites To use this workflow, you need an OpenAI account with access to the GPT-4o model, a Google account with a calendar that can be accessed through the Google Calendar API, and an active instance of n8n—either self-hosted or via n8n cloud. Within n8n, you must have two credential configurations ready: one for Google Calendar using OAuth2 authentication, and another for your OpenAI API key. 🔐 API Credentials Setup For Google Calendar, go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project. Enable the Google Calendar API, then create OAuth2 credentials by selecting “Web Application” as the application type. Add http://localhost:5678/rest/oauth2-credential/callback as the redirect URI if using local n8n. After that, go to n8n, navigate to the Credentials section, and create a new Google Calendar OAuth2 credential using your account. For OpenAI, visit platform.openai.com to retrieve your API key. Then go to the n8n Credentials page, create a new credential for OpenAI, paste your key, and name it for reference. 🔧 How to Make This Workflow Yours To customize the workflow for your use, start by replacing all instances of the calendar email rbreen.ynteractive@gmail.com with your own Google Calendar email. This email is referenced in multiple places, including Google Calendar nodes and the ToolWorkflow JSON for the node named ""Run Get Availability."" Also update any instances where the Google Calendar credential is labeled as Google Calendar account to match your own credential name within n8n. Do the same for the OpenAI credential label, replacing OpenAi account with the name of your own credential. Next, go to the node labeled Candidate Chat and copy the webhook URL. This is the public chat interface where candidates will engage with the bot—share this URL with them through email, your website, or anywhere you want to allow access. Optionally, you can also tweak the system message in the Interview Scheduler node to modify the tone, language, or logic used during conversations. If you want to add branding, update the title, subtitle, and inputPlaceholder in the Candidate Chat node, and consider modifying the final confirmation message in Final Response to User to reflect your brand voice. You can also update the business rules such as time zone, working hours, or default duration by editing the logic in the Generate 30 Minute Timeslots code node. 🧩 Workflow Explanation This workflow begins with the Candidate Chat node, which triggers when a user visits the public chat URL. The Interview Scheduler node acts as an AI agent, guiding the user through providing their email, phone number, and preferred interview time. It checks availability using the Run Get Availability tool, which in turn reads your calendar and compares it with generated free time slots from the Generate 30 Minute Timeslots node. The check day names tool helps the AI interpret natural language date expressions like “next Tuesday.” The schedule is only populated with 30-minute weekday slots from 9 AM to 5 PM Eastern Time, and no events are scheduled if they overlap with existing ones. When a suitable time is confirmed, the AI formats the result into structured JSON, creates an event on your Google Calendar, and sends a confirmation back to the user with all relevant meeting details. 🚀 Deployment Steps To deploy the interview scheduler, import the provided workflow JSON into your n8n instance. Update the Google Calendar email, OpenAI and Google credential labels, system prompts, and branding as needed. Test the connections to ensure the API credentials are working correctly. Once everything is configured, copy and share the public chat URL from the Candidate Chat node. When candidates engage with the chat, the workflow will walk them through the interview booking process, check your availability, and finalize the booking automatically. 💡 Additional Tips By default, the workflow avoids scheduling interviews on weekends and outside of 9–5 EST. Each interview lasts exactly 30 minutes, and overlapping with existing events is prevented. The assistant does not reveal details about other meetings. You can customize every part of this workflow to fit your use case, including subworkflows like Get Availability and check day names, or even white-label it for client use. This workflow is ready to become your AI-powered interview scheduling assistant. 🤝 Connect with Me Description I’m Robert Breen, founder of Ynteractive — a consulting firm that helps businesses automate operations using n8n, AI agents, and custom workflows.

3414,"Slack AI Chatbot for business team with RAG, Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Google Drive","Imagine having an AI chatbot on Slack that seamlessly integrates with your company’s workflow, automating repetitive requests. No more digging through emails or documents to find answers about IT requests, company policies, or vacation days—just ask the bot, and it will instantly provide the right information. With its 24/7 availability, the chatbot ensures that team members get immediate support without waiting for a colleague to be online, making assistance faster and more efficient. Moreover, this AI-powered bot serves as a central hub for internal communication, allowing everyone to quickly access procedures, documents, and company knowledge without searching manually. A simple Slack message is all it takes to get the information you need, enhancing productivity and collaboration across teams. How It Works Slack Trigger: The workflow starts when a user mentions the AI bot in a Slack channel. The trigger captures the message and forwards it to the AI Agent. AI Agent Processing: The AI Agent, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, processes the query. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant information from the company’s internal knowledge base stored in Qdrant (a vector database). A Simple Memory buffer retains recent conversation context (last 10 messages) for continuity. Knowledge Retrieval: The RAG tool searches Qdrant’s vector store using OpenAI embeddings to find the most relevant document chunks (top 10 matches). Response Generation: The AI synthesizes the retrieved data into a concise, structured response (1-2 sentences for the answer, 2-3 supporting details, and a source citation). The response is formatted in Slack-friendly markdown (bullet points, blockquotes) and sent back to the user. Set Up Steps Prepare Qdrant Vector Database: Create a Qdrant collection via HTTP request (Create collection node). Optionally, refresh/clear the collection (Refresh collection node) before adding new documents. Load Company Documents: Fetch files from a Google Drive folder (Get folder → Download Files). Process documents: Split text into chunks (Token Splitter) and generate embeddings (Embeddings OpenAI2). Store embeddings in Qdrant (Qdrant Vector Store1). Configure Slack Bot: Create a Slack bot via Slack API with required permissions Add the bot to the desired Slack channel and note the channelId for the workflow. Deploy AI Components: Connect the AI Agent to Anthropic’s model, RAG tool, and memory buffer. Ensure OpenAI embeddings are configured for both RAG and document processing. Test & Activate: Use the manual trigger (When clicking ‘Test workflow’) to validate document ingestion. Activate the workflow to enable real-time Slack interactions. Need help customizing?

What this AI automation workflow does Starts when a message is received Uses a Google Gemini AI Agent node to understand the context and manage the subsequent steps. It identifies if a message contains a request to save an article/link. If a URL is detected, it utilizes a tool configured with the Browserless API (via the HTTP Request node) to scrape the content of the web page. Creates a new page in a specified Notion database, populating it with thea summary scraped content, in a specific format, never leaving out any important details. It also saves the original URL, smart tags, publication date, and other metadata extracted by the AI. Posts a confirmation message (e.g., to a Discord channel) indicating whether the article was saved successfully or if an error occurred. Setup Import Workflow: Import this template into your n8n instance. Configure Credentials & Notion Database: Notion Database: Create or designate a Notion database (like the example ""Knowledge Database"") where articles will be saved. Ensure this database has the following properties (fields): Name (Type: Text) - This will store the article title. URL (Type: URL) - This will store the original article link. Description (Type: Text) - This can store the AI-generated summary. Tags (Type: Multi-select) - Optional, for categorization. Publication Date (Type: Date) - *Optional, store the date the article was published. Ensure the n8n integration has access to this specific database. If you require a different format to the Notion Database, not that you will have to update the Notion tool configuration in this n8n workflow accordingly. Notion Credential: Obtain your Notion API key and add it as a Notion credential in n8n. Select this credential in the save_to_notion tool node. Configure save_to_notion Tool: In the save_to_notion tool node within the workflow, set the 'Database ID' field to the ID of the Notion database you prepared above. Map the workflow data (URL, AI summary, etc.) to the corresponding database properties (URL, Description, etc.). In the blocks section of the notion tool, you can define a custom format for the research page, allowing the AI to fill in the exact details you want extracted from any web page! Google Gemini AI: Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console (if using Vertex AI) and add it as a credential. Select this credential in the ""Tools Agent"" node. Discord (or other notification service): If using Discord notifications, create a Webhook URL (instructions) or set up a Bot Token. Add the credential in n8n and select it in the discord_notification tool node. Configure the target Channel ID. Browserless/HTTP Request: Cloud: Obtain your API key from Browserless and configure the website_scraper HTTP Request tool node with the correct API endpoint and authentication header. Self-Hosted: Ensure your Browserless Docker container is running and accessible by n8n. Configure the website_scraper HTTP Request tool node with your self-hosted Browserless instance URL.

3631,Build your own PostgreSQL MCP server,"This n8n demonstrates how to build a simple PostgreSQL MCP server to manage your PostgreSQL database such as HR, Payroll, Sale, Inventory and More! This MCP example is based off an official MCP reference implementation which can be found here -https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres How it works A MCP server trigger is used and connected to 5 tools: 2 postgreSQL and 3 custom workflow. The 2 postgreSQL tools are simple read-only queries and as such, the postgreSQL tool can be simply used. The 3 custom workflow tools are used for select, insert and update queries as these are operations which require a bit more discretion. Whilst it may be easier to allow the agent to use raw SQL queries, we may find it a little safer to just allow for the parameters instead. The custom workflow tool allows us to define this restricted schema for tool input which we'll use to construct the SQL statement ourselves. All 3 custom workflow tools trigger the same ""Execute workflow"" trigger in this very template which has a switch to route the operation to the correct handler. Finally, we use our standard PostgreSQL node to handle select, insert and update operations. The responses are then sent back to the the MCP client. How to use This PostgreSQL MCP server allows any compatible MCP client to manage a PostgreSQL database by supporting select, create and update operations. You will need to have a database available before you can use this server. Connect your MCP client by following the n8n guidelines here - https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.mcptrigger/#integrating-with-claude-desktop Try the following queries in your MCP client: ""Please help me check if Alex has an entry in the users table. If not, please help me create a record for her."" ""What was the top selling product in the last week?"" ""How many high priority support tickets are still open this morning?""

2123,Simple Google indexing Workflow in N8N,"What it does The workflow is a simple yet efficient way to automate the process of indexing your website on Google using the Google Indexing API. How it works It works by extracting information from your sitemap, converting it into a JSON file, and looping through each URL to submit it for indexing. Here's a brief rundown of the workflow: The workflow can be triggered manually via the ""Execute Workflow"" button or scheduled to run at a specific time using the ""Schedule Trigger"" node. The sitemap of your website is fetched using the ""sitemap_set"" node with a HTTP Request to the sitemap URL. This XML sitemap is then converted into a JSON file using the ""sitemap_convert"" node. The ""sitemap_parse"" node splits the JSON file into individual URLs. The ""url_set"" node then prepares each URL to be sent to the Google Indexing API. A loop is created using the ""loop"" node to process each URL individually and make a POST request to Google Indexing API indicating that the URL has been updated. If the POST request is successful and the URL has been updated, the workflow waits for 2 seconds before moving to the next URL. In case the daily limit for the Google Indexing API is reached (200/day by default), an error message is triggered using the ""Stop and Error"" node. Before you use the workflow Activate the indexing API Create an account with Google Cloud Platform &gt; Console and then create a new project Search for the Indexing API in the Library Activate the API Create a Service Account and get credentials Open the Service accounts page.

2222,Convert an XML file to JSON via webhook call,"Who this template is for This template is for everyone who needs to work with XML data a lot and wants to convert it to JSON instead. Use case Many products still work with XML files as their main language. Unfortunately, not every software still supports XML, as many switched to more modern storing languages such as JSON. This workflow is designed to handle the conversion of XML data to JSON format via a webhook call, with error handling and Slack notifications integrated into the process. How this workflow works Triggering the workflow: This workflow initiates upon receiving an HTTP POST request at the webhook endpoint specified in the ""POST"" node. The endpoint, designated as , can be accessed externally by sending a POST request to that URL. Data routing and processing: Upon receiving the POST request, the Switch node routes the workflow's path based on conditions determined by the content type of the incoming data or any encountered errors. The Extract From File and Edit Fields (Set) nodes manage XML input processing, adapting their actions according to the data's content type. XML to JSON conversion: The XML data extracted from the input is passed through the ""XML"" node, which performs the conversion process, transforming it into JSON format. Response handling: If the XML-to-JSON conversion is successful, a success response is sent back with a status of ""OK"" and the converted JSON data. If there are any errors during the XML-to-JSON conversion process, an error response is sent back with a status of ""error"" and an error message. Error handling: in case of an error during processing, the workflow sends a notification to a Slack channel designated for error reporting. Set up steps Set up your own in the Webhook node. While building or testing a workflow, use a test webhook URL. When your workflow is ready, switch to using the production webhook URL.

3820,Dynamically switch between LLMs for AI Agents using LangChain Code,"Dynamically switch between LLMs for AI Agents using LangChain Code Purpose This example workflow demonstrates a way to connect multiple LLMs to a single AI Agent/LangChain Node and programmatically use one – or in this case loop through them. What it does This AI workflow takes in customer complaints and generates a response that is being validated before returned. If the answer was not satisfactory, the response will be generated again with a more capable model. How it works A LangChain Code Node allows multiple LLMs to be connected to a single Basic LLM Chain. On every call only one LLM is actually being connected to the Basic LLM Chain, which is determined by the index defined in a previous Node. The AI output is later validated by a Sentiment Analysis Node If the result was not satisfactory, it loops back to the beginning and executes the same query with the next available LLM The loop ends either when the result passed the requirements or when all LLMs have been used before. Setup Clone the workflow and select the belonging credentials. You'll need an OpenAI Account, alternatively you can swap the LLM nodes with ones from a different provider like Anthropic after the import. How to use Beware that the order of the used LLMs is determined by the order they have been added to the workflow, not by the position on the canvas. After cloning this workflow into your environment, open the chat and send this example message: &gt; I really love waiting two weeks just to get a keyboard that doesn’t even work. Great job. Any chance I could actually use the thing I paid for sometime this month? Most likely you will see that the first validation fails, causing it to loop back to the generation node and try again with the next available LLM. Since AI responses are unpredictable, the results and number of tries will differ for each run. Disclaimer Please note, that this workflow can only run on self-hosted n8n instances, since it requires the LangChain Code Node.",3805,2025-05-01 12:28:53.112000+00:00,True,4

3868,Automate Support Ticket Triage and Resolution with JIRA and AI,"This n8n template automates triaging of newly opened support tickets and issue resolution via JIRA. If your organisation deals with a large number of support requests daily, automating triaging is a great use-case for introducing AI to your support teams. Extending the idea, we can also get AI to give a first attempt at resolving the issue intelligently. How it works A scheduled trigger picks up newly opened JIRA support tickets from the queue and discards any seen before. An AI agent analyses the open ticket to add labels, priority on the seriousness of the issue and simplifies the description for better readability and understanding for human support. Next, the agent attempts to address and resolve the issue by finding similar issues (by tags) which have been resolved. Each similar issue has its comments analysed and summarised to identify the actual resolution and facts. These summarises are then used as context for the AI agent to suggest a fix to the open ticket. How to use Simply connect your JIRA instance to the workflow and activate to start watching for open tickets. Depending on frequency, you may need to increase for decrease the intervals. Define labels to use in the agent's system prompt. Restrict to certain projects or issue types to suit your organisation.

3971,Summarise MS Teams Channel Activity for Weekly Reports with AI,"This n8n template lets you summarize individual team member activity on MS Teams for the past week and generates a report. For remote teams, chat is a crucial communication tool to ensure work gets done but with so many conversations happening at once and in multiple threads, ideas, information and decisions usually live in the moment and get lost just as quickly - and all together forgotten by the weekend! Using this template, this doesn't have to be the case. Have AI crawl through last week's activity, summarize all messages and replies and generate a casual and snappy report to bring the team back into focus for the current week. A project manager's dream! How it works A scheduled trigger is set to run every Monday at 6am to gather all team channel messages within the last week. Messages are grouped by user. AI analyses the raw messages and replies to pull out interesting observations and highlights. This is referred to as the individual reports. All individual reports are then combined and summarized together into what becomes the team weekly report. This allows understanding of group and similar activities. Finally, the team weekly report is posted back to the channel. The timing is important as it should be the first message of the week and ready for the team to glance over coffee. How to use Ideally works best per project and where most of the comms happens on a single channel. Avoid combining channels and instead duplicate this workflow for more channels. You may need to filter for specific team members if you want specific team updates. Customise the report to suit your organisation, team or the channel. You may prefer to be more formal if clients or external stakeholders are also present. Requirements MS Teams for chat platform OpenAI for LLM Customising this workflow If the teams channel is busy enough already, consider posting the final report to email. Pull in project metrics to include in your report. As extra context, it may be interesting to tie the messages to production performance. Use an AI Agent to query for knowledgebase or tickets relevant to the messages. This may be useful for attaching links or references to add context.",3412,2025-05-10 15:05:32.396000+00:00,True,4

2383,IOT Button Remote / Spotify Control Integration with MQTT,"Overview This template integrates an IOT multi-button switch (meant for controlling a dimmable light) with Spotify playback functions, via MQTT messages. This isn't likely to work without some tinkering, but should be a good head start on receiving/routing IOT/MQTT messages and hooking up to a Spotify-like API. Requirements An IOT device capable of generating events that can be delivered as MQTT messages through an MQTT Broker e.g. Ikea Strybar remote An MQTT Broker to which n8n can connect and consume messages e.g. Zigbee2MQTT in HomeAssistant A Spotify developer-account (which provides access to API functions via OAuth2 authorization) A Spotify user-account (which provides access to Spotify streamed content, user settings, etc.) Setup Create an MQTT Credential item in n8n and assign it to the MQTT Trigger node Modify the MQTT trigger node to match the topic for your IOT device messages Modify the switch/router nodes to map to the message text from your IOT button (e.g. arrow_left_click, brightness_up_click, etc.) Create a Spotify developer-account (or use the login for a user-account) Create an ""App"" in the developer-account to represent the n8n workflow Chicken/Egg ALERT: The n8n Spotify Credentials dialog box will display the ""OAuth Redirect URL"" required to create the App in Spotify, but the n8n Credential item itself cannot be created until AFTER the App has been created. Create a Spotify Credentials item in n8n Open the Settings on the Spotify App to find the required Client ID and Client Secret information. ALERT: Save this before proceeding to the Connect step. Connect the n8n Spotify Credential item to the Spotify user-account ALERT: Expect n8n to open a separate OAuth2 window on authorization.spotify.com here, which may require a login to the Spotify user-account Open each of the HTTP and Spotify nodes, one by one, and re-assign to your Spotify Credential (try not to miss any). (Then, probably, upvote this feature request: https://community.n8n.io/t/select-credentials-via-expression/5150 Modify the variable values in the Globals node to match your own environment. target_spotify_playback_device_name - The name of a playback device available to the Spotify user-account favorite_playlist_name - The name of a playlist to start when one of the button actions is indicated in the MQTT message. Used in example ""Custom Function 2"" sequence. Notes You're on your own for getting the multi-button remote switch talking to MQTT, figuring out what the exact MQTT topic name is, and mapping the message parts to the workflow (actions, etc.). The next / previous actions are wired up to not transfer control to the target device. This alternative routing just illustrates a different behavior than the remaining actions/functions, which include activation of the target device when required. Some of the Spotify API interactions use the Spotify node in n8n, but many of the available Spotify API functions are limited or not implemented at all in the Spotify node. So, in other cases, a regular HTTP node is used with the Spotify OAuth2 API credential instead. By modifying one of the examples included in the template, it should be possible to call nearly anything the Spotify API has to offer. Spotify+n8n OAuth Mini-Tutorial Definitions The developer-account is the Spotify login for creating a spotify-app which will be associated with a client id and client secret. The user-account is the Spotify login that has permission to stream songs, set up playback devices, etc. ++A spotify-login allows access to a Spotify user-account, or a Spotify developer-account, OR BOTH++ The spotify-app, which has a client id and client secret, is an object created in the developer-account. The app-implementation (in this case, an ++n8n workflow++) uses the spotify-app's credentials (client id / client secret) to call Spotify API endpoints on behalf of a user-account. Using One Spotify Login as Both User and Developer When an n8n Spotify-node or HTTP-node (i.e. an app-implementation) calls a Spotify API endpoint, the Credentials item may be using the client id and client secret from a spotify-app, which was created in a developer-account that is ++one and the same spotify-login as the user-account++. However, it helps to remind yourself that from the Spotify API server's perspective, the developer-account + spotify-app, and the user-account, are ++two independent entities++. n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API Credential Authorization Process The 2 layers/steps, in the process of authorizing an n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential to make API calls, are: n8n must identify itself to Spotify as the app-implementation associated with the developer-account/spotify-app by sending the app's credentials (client id and client secret) to Spotify. The Client ID and Client Secret are supplied in the n8n Spotify OAuth2 Credentials UI/dialog-box Separately, n8n must obtain an authorization token from Spotify to represent the permissions granted by the user to execute actions (call API endpoints) on behalf of the user (i.e. access things that belong to the user-account). This authorization for the user-account access is obtained when the ""Connect"" or ""Reconnect"" button is clicked in the n8n Spotify Credentials UI/dialog-box (which pops up a separate authorization UI/browser-window managed by Spotify). The Authorization for a given spotify-app stays ""registered"" in the user-account until revoked. See: https://support.spotify.com/us/article/spotify-on-other-apps/ Direct Link: https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/ More than one user-account can be authorized for a given spotify-app. A particular n8n Spotify-OAuth2-API credential item appears to cache an authorization token for the user-account that was most recently authorized. Up to 25 users can be allowed access to a spotify-app in Developer-Mode, but any user-account other than the one associated with the developer-account must be added by email address at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/{{app-credential-id}}/users ALERT: IF the browser running the n8n UI is ALSO logged into a Spotify account, and the spotify-app is already authorized for that Spotify account, the ""reconnect"" button in the Spotify-OAuth2-API credential dialog may automatically grab a token for that logged in user-account, offering no opportunity to select a different user-account. This can be managed somewhat by using ""incognito"" browser windows for n8n, Spotify, or both.

Be smarter than me, read the docs) Setup Gmail creds. Change the email variables in the Set keys node How to adjust this template There's plenty to do here because the approach here is really just a starting point. Most important here is to figure out what your rules are to follow up. After a month? More than once? Also, remember to update the follow-up email!

2506,Import workflows and map their credentials using a Multi-Form,"Purpose This workflow allows you to import any workflow from a file or another n8n instance and map the credentials easily. How it works A multi-form setup guides you through the entire process At the beginning you have two options: Upload a workflow file (JSON) Copy workflow from a remote n8n instance If you choose the second option, you get to choose one of your predefined (in the Settings node) remote instances first, then it retrieves a list of all the workflows using the n8n API which you then can choose a workflow from. Now both initial options come together - the workflow file is being processed In parallel all credentials of the current instance are being retrieved using the Execute Command node The next form page enables a mapping of all the credentials used in the workflow. The matching happens between the names (because one workflow can contain different credentials of the same type) of the original credentials and the ones available on the current instance. Every option then shows all available credentials of the same type. In addition the user has always the choice to create a new credential on the fly. For every option which was set to create a new credential, an empty credential is being created on the current instance using the n8n API. An emoji is being appended to the name, which indicates that it needs to be populated. Finally the workflow gets updated with the new credential ID’s and created on the current instance using the n8n API. Then the user gets a message, if the process has succeeded or not. Setup Select your credentials in the nodes which require those Configure your remote instance(s) in the Settings node. (You can skip this step, if you only want to use the File Upload feature) Every instance is defined as object with the keys name, apiKey and baseUrl. Those instances are then wrapped inside an array. You can find an example described within a note on the workflow canvas. How to use Grab the (production) URL of the Form from the first node Open the URL and follow the instructions given in the multi-form Disclaimer Security: Beware, that all credentials are being decrypted and processed within the workflow. Also the API keys to other n8n instances are stored within the workflow. This solution is primarily meant for transferring data between testing environments. For production use consider the n8n enterprise edition which provides a reliable way to deploy workflows between different environments without the need of manual credential mapping.",2449,2024-10-29 19:05:29.604000+00:00,False,2

2369,"Parse DMARC reports, save them in database and notify on DKIM or SPF error","Who is it for If you are a postmaster or you manage email server, you can set up DKIM and SPF records to ensure that spoofing your email address is hard. On your domain you can also set up DMARC record to receive XML reports from email providers (rua tag). Those reports contain data if email they received passed DKIM and SPF verifications. Since DMARC email is public, you will receive a lot of emails from email providers, not only if DKIM/SPF fail. There is no need for it - you probably only need to know if SPF/DKIM failed. So this script is intended to automatically parse all DMARC reports that come from email providers, but ONLY send you notification if SPF or DKIM failed - meaning that either someone tries to spoof your email or your DKIM/SPF is improperly set up.

This template is for everyone who has to take notes during a call: Talent Acquisition Managers / Talent Acquisition Specialists / Recruiters HR professionals Sales teams, customer success teams Product teams / User Experience Designers / anyone conducting user research interviews Use case This workflow allows specific events created on Google Calendar (or any other meeting scheduling tool like Calendly) to trigger the duplication and renaming of a specific template document. Example: For each new screening call that is scheduled in your calendar, you want to create a draft of your screening interview template for the role, titled ""{Name of the candidate} | {Date of the interview}"", and located in your Google Drive in a specific folder This workflow could then be extended to copy the link to the file on a Notion database that is shared with the team (check ""To go further"" section). This workflow ensures that if you're jumping from calls to calls, you're already set up to take notes, and every document is tidied up and sorted in a structured way! How it works The workflow starts when a new event is created in Google Calendar The Filter node then selects a specific type of events, depending on a chosen pattern (title includes a specific term, organizer is X, attendees include Y, etc.) The workflow then searches for a specific folder in your Google Drive, where the file you want to duplicate is located The workflow then searches for the specific file you want to duplicate The last step allows to duplicate and rename the file with variables from your Google Calendar event Set up Set up credentials for Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google File. You'll need a Google Workspace account. Set up the Filter node with the pattern you want to look for to retreive specific events in your calendar Set up the Google Drive you want to search in Set up the Google File you want to duplicate Set up variable at the last step to rename your duplicated file however you want it, or add a description To go further Here's a few idea to enhance this workflow depending on your specific needs: Instead of a filter, separate your flow depending on your use case (ex: you have want to fetch different templates depending on the type of call it'll be). Switch Google Calendar for another trigger (Calendly, Hubspot..) 10 minutes before the event, send the duplicate Google File to the meeting organizer through Slack The day after the event, if the event hasn't been cancelled, add the link to the Google File to your ATS, Hubspot, etc.",2289,2024-02-28 18:06:42.472000+00:00,False,1

4217,Create OpenAI-Compatible API Using GitHub Models for Free AI Access,"This n8n template shows you how to connect Github's Free Models to your existing n8n AI workflows. Whilst it is possible to use HTTP nodes to access Github Models, The aim of this template is to use it with existing n8n LLM nodes - saves the trouble of refactoring! Please note, Github states their model APIs are not intended for production usage! If you need higher rate limits, you'll need to use a paid service. How it works The approach builds a custom OpenAI compatible API around the Github Models API - all done in n8n! First, we attach an OpenAI subnode to our LLM node and configure a new OpenAI credential. Within this new OpenAI credential, we change the ""Base URL"" to point at a n8n webhook we've prepared as part of this template. Next, we create 2 webhooks which the LLM node will now attempt to connect with: ""models"" and ""chat completion"". The ""models"" webhook simply calls the Github Model's ""list all models"" endpoint and remaps the response to be compatible with our LLM node. The ""Chat Completion"" webhook does a similar task with Github's Chat Completion endpoint. How to use Once connected, just open chat and ask away! Any LLM or AI agent node connected with this custom LLM subnode will send requests to the Github Models API. Allowing your to try out a range of SOTA models for free. Requirements Github account and credentials for access to Models. If you've used the Github node previously, you can reuse this credential for this template. Customising this workflow This template is just an example. Use the custom OpenAI credential for your other workflows to test Github models.

2603,Generate n8n Forms from Airtable and BaseRow Tables,"This n8n template showcases a cool feature of n8n Forms where the form itself can be defined dynamically using the form fields schema. It may be debateable how useful this template actually is since both Airtable and Baserow provide form interfaces already but still a great exercise and demonstration if ever the use-case comes around. How it works A form trigger is used to dynamically select a database/table from which to build the n8n form from. the table's schema is imported into the workflow and using the code node, is converted into the n8n form fields schema. This let's us dynamically build the fields in our n8n form when we choose to define the form using the JSON option. Once the n8n form submits, we convert the values back into our table's API schema so that we can create a new row. Note any files/attachments fields are removed as they need to be handled separately. Files are processed separately as they may first need to be stored. Once complete, the reference is saved into the newly created row. Check out the example Airtable here - https://airtable.com/appfP15Xd0aVZR9xV/shrGFgXLyQ4Jg58SU How to use The n8n form is autogenerated which means you only need provide access to the table. Using this approach, this template can be reused for any number of Airtable and/or Baserow tables. Requirements You'll need either an Airtable account or a Baserow account to use this template. Accessible n8n instance to your users Customising this workflow Not using either Airtable or Baserow? Theoretically any datastore which provides a fields schema can be used with this template. If you're feeling creative, split the table into multiple forms for a better user experience.",2047,2024-12-03 14:34:43.509000+00:00,False,3

4273,Evaluation metric example: RAG document relevance,"AI evaluation in n8n This is a template for n8n's evaluation feature. Evaluation is a technique for getting confidence that your AI workflow performs reliably, by running a test dataset containing different inputs through the workflow. By calculating a metric (score) for each input, you can see where the workflow is performing well and where it isn't. How it works This template shows how to calculate a workflow evaluation metric: retrieved document relevance (i.e. whether the information retrieved from a vector store is relevant to the question). The workflow takes a question and checks whether the information retrieved to answer it is relevant. To run this workflow, you need to insert documents into a vector data store, so that they can be retrieved by the agent to answer questions. You can do this by running the top part of the workflow once. The main workflow works as follows: We use an evaluation trigger to read in our dataset It is wired up in parallel with the regular trigger so that the workflow can be started from either one. More info We make sure that the agent outputs the list data from the tools that it used If we’re evaluating (i.e. the execution started from the evaluation trigger), we calculate the relevance metric using AI to compare the retrieved documents with the question We pass this information back to n8n as a metric If we’re not evaluating we avoid calculating the metric, to reduce cost",2022,2025-05-21 08:19:43.930000+00:00,True,9

2318,Enrich Pipedrive's Organization Data with OpenAI GPT-4o & Notify it in Slack,"This workflow enriches new Pipedrive organization's data by adding a note to the organization object in Pipedrive. It assumes there is a custom ""website"" field in your Pipedrive setup, as data will be scraped from this website to generate a note using OpenAI. Then, a notification is sent in Slack. ⚠️ Disclaimer This workflow uses a scraping API. Before using it, ensure you comply with the regulations regarding web scraping in your country or state. Important Notes The OpenAI model used is GPT-4o, chosen for its large input token capacity. However, it is not the cheapest model if cost is very important to you. The system prompt in the OpenAI Node generates output with relevant information, but feel free to improve or modify it according to your needs. How It Works Node 1: Pipedrive Trigger - An Organization is Created This is the trigger of the workflow. When an organization object is created in Pipedrive, this node is triggered and retrieves the data. Make sure you have a ""website"" custom field in Pipedrive (the name of the field in the n8n node will appear as a random ID and not with the Pipedrive custom field name). Node 2: ScrapingBee - Get Organization's Website's Homepage Content This node scrapes the content from the URL of the website associated with the Pipedrive Organization created in Node 1. The workflow uses the ScrapingBee API, but you can use any preferred API or simply the HTTP request node in n8n. Node 3: OpenAI - Message GPT-4o with Scraped Data This node sends HTML-scraped data from the previous node to the OpenAI GPT-4o model. The system prompt instructs the model to extract company data, such as products or services offered and competitors (if known by the model), and format it as HTML for optimal use in a Pipedrive Note. Node 4: Pipedrive - Create a Note with OpenAI Output This node adds a Note to the Organization created in Pipedrive using the OpenAI node output. The Note will include the company description, target market, selling products, and competitors (if GPT-4o was able to determine them). Node 5 & 6: HTML To Markdown & Code - Markdown to Slack Markdown These two nodes format the HTML output to Slack Markdown. The Note created in Pipedrive is in HTML format, as specified by the System Prompt of the OpenAI Node. To send it to Slack, it needs to be converted to Markdown and then to Slack Markdown. Node 7: Slack - Notify This node sends a message in Slack containing the Pipedrive Organization Note created with this workflow.",1864,2024-07-06 16:24:36.463000+00:00,True,5

Normally this includes a manual grooming of new bugs that have arrived in your ticketing system (in our case Linear). We found this way too time-consuming. That's why we built this workflow. What this workflow does This workflow triggers every time a Linear issue is created or updated within a certain team. For us at n8n, we created one general team called Engineering where all bugs get added in the beginning. The workflow then checks if the issue meets the criteria to be auto-moved to a certain team. In our case, that means that the description is filled, that it has the bug label, and that it's in the Triage state. The workflow then classifies the bug using OpenAI's GPT-4 model before updating the team property of the Linear issue. If the AI fails to classify a team, the workflow sends an alert to Slack. Setup Add your Linear and OpenAi credentials Change the team in the Linear Trigger to match your needs Customize your teams and their areas of responsibility in the Set me up node. Please use the format Teamname. Also, make sure that the team names match the names in Linear exactly. Change the Slack channel in the Set me up node to your Slack channel of choice.

2376,Backup Tag-Selected Workflows to Gitlab,"Fetches workflow definitions from within n8n, selecting only the ones that have one or more (configurable) assigned tags and then: Derives a suitable backup filename by reducing the workflow name to a string with alphanumeric characters and no-spaces Note: This isn't bulletproof, but works as long as workflow names aren't too crazy. Determines which workflows need to be backed up based on whether each one: has been modified. (Note: Even repositioning a node counts.) ...or... is new. (Note: Renaming counts as this.) Commits JSON copies of each workflow, as necessary, to a Gitlab repository with a generated, date-stamped commit message. Setup Credentials Create a Gitlab Credentials item and assign it to all Gitlab nodes. Create an n8n Credentials item and assign it to the n8n node Note: This was tested with http://localhost:5678/api/v1 but should work with any reachable n8n instance and API key. Modify these values in the ""Globals"" Node gitlab_owner - {{your gitlab account}} gitlab_project - {{ your gitlab project name }} gitlab_workflow_path - {{ subdirectory in the project where backup files should be saved/committed }} tags_to_match_for_backup - {{tag(s) to match for backup selection}} *ALERT: According to the n8n node's Filters -&gt; tags field annotations, and API documentation, this supports a CSV list of multiple tags (e.g. tag1,tag2), but the API behavior requires workflows to have all-of the listed tags, not any-of them.* See: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/10348 TL/DR - Don't expect a multiple tag list to be more inclusive. Possible workaround: To match more than one tag value, duplicate the n8n node into multiple single-tag matches, or split and iterate multiple values, and merge the results. Possible Enhancements Make the branch (""Reference"") for all the gitlab nodes configurable. Fixed on all as ""main"" in the template. Add an n8n node to generate an audit and store the output in gitlab along with the backups.

4528,Transcribe Voice Messages from Telegram using OpenAI Whisper-1,"This n8n workflow processes incoming Telegram messages, differentiating between text and voice messages. How it works: Message Trigger: The workflow initiates when a new message is received via the Telegram ""Message Trigger"" node. Switch Node: This node acts as a router. It examines the incoming message: If the message is text, it directs the flow along the ""text"" branch. If the message contains voice, it directs the flow along the ""voice"" branch. Get Audio File: For audio messages, this node downloads the audio file from Telegram. Transcribe Audio: The downloaded audio file is then sent to an ""OpenAI Transcribe Recording"" node, which uses OpenAI's whisper-1 speech-to-text model to convert the audio into a text transcript. Send Transcription Message: Regardless of whether the original message was text or transcribed audio, the final text content is then passed to a ""Send transcription message"" node. Setup Requirements: Telegram Bot Token**: You will need a Telegram bot token configured in the ""Message Trigger"" node to receive messages. OpenAI API Key**: An OpenAI API key is required for the ""Transcribe audio"" node to perform speech transcription. Additional Notes: This workflow provides a foundational step for building more complex AI-driven applications. The transcribed text or original text message can be easily piped into an AI agent (e.g., a large language model) for analysis, response generation, or interaction with other tools, extending the bot's capabilities beyond simple message reception and transcription. 👉 Need Help?

4596,QR Code Generator via Webhook,"This n8n template allows you to instantly generate QR codes from any text or URL by simply sending a webhook request. It's a versatile tool for creating dynamic QR codes for various purposes, from marketing campaigns to event registrations, directly integrated into your automated workflows. 🔧 How it works Receive Data Webhook: This node acts as the entry point for the workflow. It listens for incoming POST requests and expects a JSON body with a data property containing the text or URL you want to encode into the QR code. Generate QR Code: This node makes an HTTP GET request to the QR Server API (api.qrserver.com) to generate the QR code image. The content from your webhook is passed as the data parameter to the API. Respond with QR Code: This node sends the response from the QR Server API back to the service that initiated the webhook. The QR Server API directly returns the image data, so your webhook response will be the QR code image itself. 👤 Who is it for? This workflow is ideal for: Marketers: Generate QR codes for product links, event registrations, or promotional materials on the fly. Developers: Integrate QR code generation into applications, websites, or internal tools. Event Organizers: Create dynamic QR codes for ticketing, information access, or check-ins. Businesses: Streamline processes requiring physical-to-digital transitions, like menu access or contact sharing. Automation Enthusiasts: Add QR code generation capabilities to any workflow. 📑 Data Structure When you trigger the webhook, send a POST request with a JSON body structured as follows: { ""data"": ""https://www.yourwebsite.com/your-specific-page-or-text-to-encode"" } The workflow will return the QR code image directly in the response. ⚙️ Setup Instructions Import Workflow: In your n8n editor, click ""Import from JSON"" and paste the provided workflow JSON. Configure Webhook Path: Double-click the Receive Data Webhook node. In the 'Path' field, set a unique and descriptive path (e.g., /generate-qr). Customize QR Code (Optional): Double-click the Generate QR Code node. You can adjust the size parameter in the URL (e.g., size=200x200 for a larger QR code) or add other parameters supported by the QR Server API (e.g., bgcolor, color, qzone). Activate Workflow: Save and activate the workflow. 📝 Tips Handling the Image Output: Since the QR Server API directly returns the image, the webhook response will be the image data. Depending on your use case, you might want to: Save to File/Cloud: Insert a node (e.g., Write Binary File, Amazon S3, Google Drive) after Generate QR Code to save the image to a file system or cloud storage. Embed in HTML/Email: If you're building an HTML response or sending an email, you might need to convert the image data to a Base64 string or provide a URL to a saved image. Error Handling: Enhance workflow robustness by adding an Error Trigger node. This allows you to catch any issues during QR code generation and set up notifications or logging. Dynamic Size/Color: You can extend the Receive Data Webhook to accept parameters for size, color, or bgcolor in the incoming JSON. Then, dynamically pass these to the url of the Generate QR Code node to create highly customizable QR codes. Input Validation: For more advanced use cases, you could add a Function node after the webhook to validate the incoming data to ensure it's in a valid format (e.g., a URL).",1573,2025-06-02 14:37:16.047000+00:00,False,1

2284,Provide Real-Time Updates for Notion Databases via Webhooks with Supabase,"Purpose This enables webhooks for nearly realtime updates (every 5 seconds) from Notion Databases. Problem Notion does not offer webhooks. Even worse, the “Last edited time” property, we could use for polling, only updates every minute. This gives us a polling interval only as low as 2 minutes and we still need to implement a comparing mechanism to detect changes. Solution This workflow caches states in between while doing efficient polling & comparing. It brings down the update latency from 2 minutes to 5 seconds and also provides the output of the changes only.

2387,Send file to kindle with Telegram Bot and Outlook,"Workflow Overview This workflow automates the process of forwarding e-book files to a Kindle device using a Telegram bot and Outlook email. Setup Steps: Telegram Bot Setup: Create a Telegram bot via BotFather and configure its credentials in the workflow. Outlook Email Configuration: Set up your Outlook email credentials. (Currently, only Outlook is supported, but you can modify the workflow to support other email providers.) Amazon Kindle Email Setup: Find your Kindle device's email address from your Amazon account. This will be the recipient address for the e-books. Allow Email Sending to Kindle: Ensure your Amazon account is configured to allow emails from your Outlook address to send files to your Kindle. Workflow Explanation: The workflow begins with a Telegram bot trigger node that listens for new chat messages. When a new message is received, the workflow checks if the message contains a file attachment. If no file is detected, the bot will send a warning reply to the user in the chat. If a file is found, it will be renamed to ensure it appears correctly on the Kindle device when sent. The workflow then composes an email with the file attached and sends it to the Kindle's receiving address. If the email is sent successfully, the bot will notify the user with a success message in the chat. Only Amazon-supported file types will be accepted by Kindle. If sending fails, you will receive a notification email from Amazon in your Outlook inbox. In case of delivery issues, retry sending the file as network issues may occasionally interfere with the process.",1525,2024-08-23 03:03:13.336000+00:00,False,3

This series of workflows shows how to build big data analysis tools for production-ready AI agents with the help of vector databases. These pipelines are adaptable to any dataset of images, hence, many production use cases. Uploading (image) datasets to Qdrant Set up meta-variables for anomaly detection in Qdrant Anomaly detection tool KNN classifier tool For anomaly detection The first pipeline to upload an image dataset to Qdrant. The second pipeline is to set up cluster (class) centres & cluster (class) threshold scores needed for anomaly detection. The third is the anomaly detection tool, which takes any image as input and uses all preparatory work done with Qdrant to detect if it's an anomaly to the uploaded dataset. For KNN (k nearest neighbours) classification The first pipeline to upload an image dataset to Qdrant. This pipeline is the KNN classifier tool, which takes any image as input and classifies it on the uploaded to Qdrant dataset. To recreate both You'll have to upload crops and lands datasets from Kaggle to your own Google Storage bucket, and re-create APIs/connections to Qdrant Cloud (you can use Free Tier cluster), Voyage AI API & Google Cloud Storage. [This workflow] KNN classification tool This tool takes any image URL, and as output, it returns a class of the object on the image based on the image uploaded to the Qdrant dataset (lands). An image URL is received via the Execute Workflow Trigger, which is then sent to the Voyage AI Multimodal Embeddings API to fetch its embedding. The image's embedding vector is then used to query Qdrant, returning a set of X similar images with pre-labeled classes. Majority voting is done for classes of neighbouring images. A loop is used to resolve scenarios where there is a tie in Majority Voting, and we increase the number of neighbours to retrieve. When the loop finally resolves, the identified class is returned to the calling workflow.",1487,2024-12-19 09:50:11.092000+00:00,True,2

2556,Exponential Backoff for Google APIs,"n8n Workflow: Exponential Backoff for Google APIs Overview This n8n workflow implements an Exponential Backoff mechanism to handle retries when interacting with Google APIs. It ensures that failed API requests are retried with increasing delays, up to a specified maximum retry count. This approach helps mitigate transient errors (e.g., rate limits or temporary network issues) while maintaining workflow efficiency. Key Features: Exponential Backoff Logic**: Dynamically increases wait time between retries based on the retry count. Error Handling**: Stops the workflow and raises an error after a specified number of retries. Dynamic Waiting**: Waits for a calculated duration before each retry. Scalable Design**: Modular nodes for easy debugging and customization. Workflow Details Nodes in the Workflow: Trigger (When clicking ""Test Workflow""): Manually starts the workflow for testing. Loop Over Items: Iterates over multiple input items to process Google API requests row by row. Google API Node (Example: Update Sheet): Sends a request to a Google API endpoint (e.g., updating a row in Google Sheets). On success: Moves to the next item in the loop. On error: Passes the error to the Exponential Backoff node. Exponential Backoff: Calculates the delay for the next retry based on the retry count. Logic: const retryCount = $json[""retryCount""] || 0; const maxRetries = 5; const initialDelay = 1; // in seconds if (retryCount &lt; maxRetries) { const currentDelayInSeconds = initialDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount); return { json: { retryCount: retryCount + 1, waitTimeInSeconds: currentDelayInSeconds, status: 'retrying', } }; } else { return { json: { error: 'Max retries exceeded', retryCount: retryCount, status: 'failed' } }; } Wait: Dynamically waits for the waitTimeInSeconds value calculated in the Exponential Backoff node. Configuration: Resume: After Time Interval Wait Amount: {{ $json[""waitTimeInSeconds""] }} Unit: Seconds Check Max Retries: Evaluates whether the retry count has exceeded the maximum limit. Routes the workflow: True: Passes to the Stop and Error node. False: Loops back to the Google API node for retry. Stop and Error: Stops the workflow and logs the error when the maximum retry count is reached. Parameters Configurable Settings: Max Retries: Defined in the Exponential Backoff node (const maxRetries = 5). Adjust this value based on your requirements. Initial Delay: The starting wait time for retries, defined as 1 second. Google API Configuration: Ensure your Google API node is properly authenticated and configured with the desired endpoint and parameters. How to Use Import the Workflow: Copy the workflow JSON and import it into your n8n instance. Configure Google API Node: Set up the Google API node with your credentials and target API endpoint (e.g., Google Sheets, Gmail, etc.). Test the Workflow: Manually trigger the workflow and observe the retry behavior in case of errors. Monitor Logs: Use the console logs in the Exponential Backoff node to debug retry timings and status. Example Scenarios Scenario 1: Successful Execution The Google API processes all requests without errors. Workflow completes without triggering the retry logic. Scenario 2: Transient API Errors The Google API returns an error (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests). The workflow retries the request with increasing wait times. Scenario 3: Maximum Retries Exceeded The workflow reaches the maximum retry count (e.g., 5 retries). An error is raised, and the workflow stops. Considerations Jitter: This workflow does not implement jitter (randomized delay) since it's not required for low-volume use cases. If needed, jitter can be added to the exponential backoff calculation. Retry Storms: If multiple workflows run simultaneously, ensure your API quotas can handle potential retries. Error Handling Beyond Max Retries: Customize the Stop and Error node to notify stakeholders or log errors in a centralized system. Customization Options Adjust the maximum retry limit and delay calculation to suit your use case. Add additional logic to handle specific error codes differently. Extend the workflow to notify stakeholders when an error occurs (e.g., via Slack or email). Troubleshooting Retry Not Triggering**: Ensure the retryCount variable is passed correctly between nodes. Confirm that the error output from the Google API node flows to the Exponential Backoff node. Incorrect Wait Time**: Verify the Wait node is referencing the correct field for waitTimeInSeconds. Request for Feedback We are always looking to improve this workflow. If you have suggestions, improvements, or ideas for additional features, please feel free to share them. Your feedback helps us refine and enhance this solution!",1340,2024-11-18 21:52:56.975000+00:00,False,2

8779,🤖 Self Improving Email AI Support with Human-in-the-Loop,"How it works This workflow creates a sophisticated, self-improving customer support system that automatically handles incoming emails. It's designed to answer common questions using an AI-powered knowledge base and, crucially, to learn from human experts when new or complex questions arise, continuously expanding its capabilities. Think of it like having an AI assistant with a smart memory and a human mentor. Here's the step-by-step process: New Email Received: The workflow is triggered whenever a new email arrives in your designated support inbox (via Gmail). Classify Request: An AI model (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) first classifies the incoming email to ensure it's a genuine support request, filtering out irrelevant messages. Retrieve Knowledge Base: The workflow fetches all existing Question and Answer pairs from your dedicated Google Sheet knowledge base. AI Answer Attempt: A powerful AI model (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro) analyzes the customer's email against the entire knowledge base. It attempts to find a highly relevant answer and drafts a complete HTML email response if successful. Decision Point: An IF node checks if the AI found a confident answer. If Answer Found: The AI-generated HTML response is immediately sent back to the customer via Gmail. If No Answer Found (Human-in-the-Loop): Escalate to Human: The customer's summarized question and original email are forwarded to a human expert (you or your team) via Gmail, requesting their assistance. Human Reply & AI Learning: The workflow waits for the human expert's reply. Once received, another AI model (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) processes both the original customer question and the expert's reply to distill them into a new, generic, and reusable Question/Answer pair. Update Knowledge Base: This newly created Q&A pair is then automatically added as a new row to your Google Sheet knowledge base, ensuring the system can answer similar questions automatically in the future. Set up steps Setup time: ~10-15 minutes This workflow requires connecting your Gmail and Google Sheets accounts, and obtaining a Google AI API key. Follow these steps carefully: Connect Your Gmail Account: Select the On New Email Received node. Click the Credential dropdown and select + Create New Credential to connect your Gmail account. Grant the necessary permissions. Repeat this for the Send AI Answer and Ask Human for Help nodes, selecting the credential you just created. Connect Your Google Sheets Account: Select the Get Knowledge Base node. Click the Credential dropdown and select + Create New Credential to connect your Google account. Grant the necessary permissions. Repeat this for the Add to Knowledge Base node, selecting the credential you just created. Set up Your Google Sheet Knowledge Base: Create a new Google Sheet in your Google Drive. Rename the first sheet (tab) to QA Database. In the first row of QA Database, add two column headers: Question (in cell A1) and Answer (in cell B1). Go back to the Get Knowledge Base node in n8n. In the Document ID field, select your newly created Google Sheet. Do the same for the Add to Knowledge Base node. Get Your Google AI API Key (for Gemini Models): Visit Google AI Studio at aistudio.google.com/app/apikey. Click ""Create API key in new project"" and copy the key. In the workflow, go to the Google Gemini 2.5 Pro node, click the Credential dropdown, and select + Create New Credential. Paste your key into the API Key field and Save. Repeat this for the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash nodes, selecting the credential you just created. Configure Human Expert Email: Select the Ask Human for Help node. In the Send To field, replace the placeholder email address with the actual email address of your human expert (e.g., your own email or a team support email). Activate the Workflow: Once all credentials and configurations are set, activate the workflow using the toggle switch at the top right of your n8n canvas. Start Learning! Send a test email to the Gmail account connected to the On New Email Received node. Observe how the AI responds, or how it escalates to your expert email and then learns from the reply.

4651,Create a Branded AI Chatbot for Websites with Flowise Multi-Agent Chatflows,"This workflow integrates Flowise Multi-Agent Chatflows into a custom-branded n8n chatbot, enabling real-time interaction between users and AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs). Key Advantages: ✅ Easy Integration with Flowise: Uses a low-code HTTP node to send user questions to Flowise's API (/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID) and receive intelligent responses. Supports multi-agent chatflows, allowing for complex, dynamic interactions. 🎨 Customizable Chatbot UI: Includes pre-built JavaScript for embedding the n8n chatbot into any website. Provides customization options such as welcome messages, branding, placeholder text, chat modes (e.g., popup or embedded), and language support. 🔐 Secure & Configurable: Authorization via Bearer token headers for Flowise API access. Clearly marked notes in the workflow for setting environment variables like FLOWISE_URL and FLOW_ID. How It Works Chat Trigger: The workflow starts with the When chat message received node, which acts as a webhook to receive incoming chat messages from users. HTTP Request to Flowise: The received message is forwarded to the Flowise node, which sends a POST request to a Flowise API endpoint (https://FLOWISEURL/api/v1/prediction/FLOWISE_ID). The request includes the user's input as a JSON payload ({""question"": ""{{ $json.chatInput }}""}) and uses HTTP header authentication (e.g., Authorization: Bearer FLOWSIE_API). Response Handling: The response from Flowise is passed to the Edit Fields node, which maps the output ($json.text) for further processing or display. Set Up Steps Configure Flowise Integration: Replace FLOWISEURL and FLOWISE_ID in the HTTP Request node with your Flowise instance URL and flow ID. Ensure the Authorization header is set correctly in the credentials (e.g., Bearer FLOWSIE_API). Embed n8n Chatbot: Use the provided JavaScript snippet in the sticky notes to embed the n8n chatbot on your website. Replace YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL with the webhook URL generated by the When chat message received node. Customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior (e.g., welcome messages, language, UI elements) using the createChat configuration options. Optional Branding: Adjust the sticky note examples to include branding details, such as custom messages, colors, or metadata for the chatbot. Activate Workflow: Toggle the workflow to ""Active"" in n8n and test the chat functionality end-to-end. Ideal Use Cases: Embedding branded AI assistants into websites. Connecting Flowise-powered agents with customer support chatbots. Creating dynamic, smart conversational flows with LLMs via n8n automation. Need help customizing?

2857,Pattern for Multiple Triggers Combined to Continue Workflow,"Overview This template describes a possible approach to handle a pseudo-callback/trigger from an independent, external process (initiated from a workflow) and combine the received input with the workflow execution that is already in progress. This requires the external system to pass through some context information (resumeUrl), but allows the ""primary"" workflow execution to continue with BOTH its own (previous-node) context, AND the input received in the ""secondary"" trigger/process. Primary Workflow Trigger/Execution The workflow path from the primary trigger initiates some external, independent process and provides ""context"" which includes the value of $execution.resumeUrl. This execution then reaches a Wait node configured with Resume - On Webhook Call and stops until a call to resumeUrl is received. External, Independent Process The external, independent process could be anything like a Telegram conversation, or a web-service as long as: it results in a single execution of the Secondary Workflow Trigger, and it can pass through the value of resumeUrl associated with the Primary Workflow Execution Secondary Workflow Trigger/Execution The secondary workflow execution can start with any kind of trigger as long as part of the input can include the resumeUrl. To combine / rejoin the primary workflow execution, this execution passes along whatever it receives from its trigger input to the resume-webhook endpoint on the Wait node. Notes IMPORTANT: The workflow ids in the Set nodes marked **Update Me have embedded references to the workflow IDs in the original system. They will need to be CHANGED to make this demo work. Note: The Resume Other Workflow Execution node in the template uses the $env.WEBHOOK_URL configuration to convert to an internal ""localhost"" call in a Docker environment. This can be done differently. ALERT:** This pattern is NOT suitable for a workflow that handles multiple items because the first workflow execution will only be waiting for one callback. The second workflow (not the second trigger in the first workflow) is just to demonstrate how the Independent, External Process needs to work.",1190,2025-02-07 01:14:59.594000+00:00,False,1

You can even run it multiple times, to be sure. But if you need to make sure it extracts everything you might need to think about an Multi-Agent Setup with Validation-Agent Steps.

4609,Automatic Workflow & Credentials Backup to GitHub with Change Detection,"This n8n workflow template uses community nodes and is only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n. Title: n8n Credentials and Workflows Backup on Change Detection Purpose: Never lose track of your n8n changes again! This workflow smartly backs up all your workflows and credentials, automatically detects any changes using hash comparison, and pushes updates to GitHub—but only when something has actually changed. Set your own interval and stop cluttering your repo with redundant commits. Walkthrough Video on YouTube Trigger: Schedule Trigger**: Executes the entire process at a user-defined interval. No need to worry about traceability or managing countless backups, as the workflow only commits changes when a difference is detected. Workflow Backup Process: Set Workflow Path: Defines the local backup file path for workflows. Get Old Workflow Hash: Executes a helper workflow to retrieve the previous hash. Execute Workflow Backup: Runs n8n export:workflow to export all workflows to the defined file path. Get New Workflow Hash: Executes a helper workflow to generate the new hash from the exported file. Compare Hashes (If Workflow Updated): Checks if the new hash differs from the old one. If Updated: Read Workflow Data → Extract Text → Push to GitHub: Reads, extracts, and commits the updated workflow JSON to GitHub under a timestamped filename. Credential Backup Process: Set Credential Path: Defines the local backup file path for credentials. Get Old Credential Hash: Executes a helper workflow to retrieve the previous hash. Execute Credential Backup: Runs n8n export:credentials to export all credentials. Get New Credential Hash: Executes a helper workflow to generate the new hash from the exported file. Compare Hashes (If Credential Updated): Checks for changes. If Updated: Read Credential Data → Extract Text → Push to GitHub: Commits the new credentials JSON to GitHub if changes are found. Hash Generator (Helper Flow): Used in both workflow and credential backup paths: Read File* → *Extract Text* → *Hash Data** Outputs SHA-256 hash used for comparison GitHub Integration: Commits are created with ISO timestamp in the filename and message. Repository: https://github.com/your-github-name/n8n-onchange-bachup File paths: backups/WorkFlow Backup -timestamp-.json and backups/Credential Backup -timestamp-.json Change Detection Logic: Only commits files when hash changes are detected (i.e., actual content change). Avoids unnecessary GitHub commits and storage use.

2684,Check if a Twitch Stream is Live,"Introduction: This workflow template helps you determine if a Twitch user's stream is currently live or offline. Setup Instructions: The Document node holds the sample Twitch username you wish to check, you may adapt it in your workflow by replacing this with a chain that contains the Twitch username you want to check. This value is passed to the GraphQL node query as $('Document').item.json.twitch so make sure to change this based on your workflow. How it Works: The important nodes here are the GrapQL and IF nodes. The GrapQL queries the Twitch API, and then the output returns a document with the stream property. The IF node then checks if this property has a value, if null means the user is offline, otherwise the user is online or live. Common Use Cases: You can use this with other workflow templates to post live stream alerts to Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Discord via webhooks, etc to notify your community to join youR stream. You may also use an LLM node to write a custom alert based on the value of property title How to adjust this template If you want to check a list of Twitch channels, you can simply exchange the Document set node in the beginning with your list of channels.

2512,Qualys Scan Slack Report Subworkflow,"Introducing the Qualys Scan Slack Report Subworkflow—a robust solution designed to automate the generation and retrieval of security reports from the Qualys API. This workflow is a sub workflow of the Qualys Slack Shortcut Bot workflow. It is triggered when someone fills out the modal popup in slack generated by the Qualys Slack Shortcut Bot. When deploying this workflow, use the Demo Data node to simulate the data that is input via the Execute Workflow Trigger. That data flows into the Global Variables Node which is then referenced by the rest of the workflow. It includes nodes to Fetch the Report IDs and then Launch a report, and then check the report status periodically and download the completed report, which is then posted to Slack for easy access. For Security Operations Centers (SOCs), this workflow provides significant benefits by automating tedious tasks, ensuring timely updates, and facilitating efficient data handling. How It Works Fetch Report Templates:** The ""Fetch Report IDs"" node retrieves a list of available report templates from Qualys. This automated retrieval saves time and ensures that the latest templates are used, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of reports. Convert XML to JSON:** The response is converted to JSON format for easier manipulation. This step simplifies data handling, making it easier for SOC analysts to work with the data and integrate it into other tools or processes. Launch Report:** A POST request is sent to Qualys to initiate report generation using specified parameters like template ID and report title. Automating this step ensures consistency and reduces the chance of human error, improving the reliability of the reports generated. Loop and Check Status:** The workflow loops every minute to check if the report generation is complete. Continuous monitoring automates the waiting process, freeing up SOC analysts to focus on higher-priority tasks while ensuring they are promptly notified when reports are ready. Download Report:** Once the report is ready, it is downloaded from Qualys. Automated downloading ensures that the latest data is always available without manual intervention, improving efficiency. Post to Slack:** The final report is posted to a designated Slack channel for quick access. This integration with Slack ensures that the team can promptly access and review the reports, facilitating swift action and decision-making. Get Started Ensure your Slack and Qualys integrations are properly set up. Customize the workflow to fit your specific reporting needs.

Google Suite Automation:** Manage Google Calendar: Create events, find upcoming holidays, and list birthdays. Google Drive: Search for PDF files and manage document templates. Google Docs: Automatically generate invoices from templates. Intelligent Web Search:** Employs Brave Search for fetching real-time information from the web. Versatile AI Agent:** Leverages Google Gemini with a suite of tools including a calculator, date & time utilities, and custom integrations (e.g., example Airbnb tools). Command-Driven Functionality:** Easily trigger specific actions using Telegram commands like /help, /pdf, /rag, /invoice, /chat, /brave, and /birthday. ⚙️ How It Works The workflow is initiated by messages or commands sent to your Telegram bot. A central Switch node directs the flow based on the input received. 1. Telegram Interaction & Command Routing A Telegram Trigger node listens for new messages (text or voice). A ""typing..."" indicator is sent to Telegram for better user experience. The Switch node parses the message content and routes it to the appropriate sub-workflow based on predefined commands (e.g., /pdf, /rag, /voice) or general chat. 2. AI Voice Bot Functionality For voice messages (or if the voice path is triggered): The voice file is downloaded from Telegram. OpenAI Whisper transcribes the audio into text. The transcribed text is fed to an AI Agent (powered by Google Gemini and equipped with various tools and memory). The AI Agent's text response is then sent to the Replicate API to generate a natural-sounding voice. The generated audio response is sent back to the user on Telegram. 3. PDF RAG System with Mistral OCR & Qdrant Indexing PDFs (via /qdrant &lt;Google_Drive_File_ID&gt; command):** The specified PDF is downloaded from Google Drive. The PDF is uploaded to Mistral AI for OCR processing. The extracted text (in markdown format) is retrieved. The text is split into manageable chunks. OpenAI Embeddings are generated for each chunk. These chunks and their embeddings are stored in a Qdrant vector collection. A confirmation message is sent to Telegram. Querying PDFs (via /rag &lt;your_question&gt; command):** The user's question is processed by a RetrievalQA Chain. This chain uses Google Gemini as the Language Model and retrieves relevant document chunks from Qdrant based on semantic similarity (embeddings). Google Gemini then generates a concise answer based on the user's question and the retrieved contextual information from the documents. The answer is sent back to the user on Telegram. Searching PDFs in Drive (via /pdf &lt;search_term&gt; command):** Searches your Google Drive for PDF files matching the provided search term. Sends a list of found PDF files (name and ID) to the user on Telegram, allowing them to easily identify files for indexing with /qdrant. 4. AI Chat & Task Automation (General Chat & /chat command) Handles general text messages or transcribed voice inputs that are not specific commands. An AI Agent (Google Gemini) processes these inputs. The agent is equipped with tools such as: Google Calendar Tools: To create events, find the next public holiday, or list upcoming birthdays. Brave Search Tool: To search the internet for information. Calculator Tool: For mathematical computations. Date & Time Utility: For handling and formatting dates. Example Airbnb Tools: Demonstrates extensibility for custom tool integrations. The agent utilizes a ""Think Node"" process for reasoning and Window Buffer Memory to maintain conversational context. Responses are formulated and sent back to the user on Telegram. 5. Google Automations Invoice Generation (via /invoice command):** Copies a predefined Google Docs invoice template from your Google Drive. Populates the new document with details (client name, items, etc. – currently uses placeholder data from an 'Edit Fields' node, which can be customized to parse input from the command). Converts the populated Google Doc into a PDF file. Sends the generated PDF invoice to the user via Telegram. Calendar Management (via AI Agent or specific commands like /birthday):** The /birthday command fetches upcoming birthdays from a specified Google Calendar. The AI Agent can also interact with Google Calendar to create events or retrieve information based on natural language requests. 6. Web Search (via /brave &lt;query&gt; command or AI Agent) Performs a web search using the Brave Search API. Returns a list of search results, including titles and URLs, to the user on Telegram. 7. Help Command (/help) Provides the user with a formatted list of all available Telegram commands and their basic usage instructions. 🛠️ Setup Steps & Credentials To get this workflow bundle up and running, you'll need to configure several credentials: Telegram: Create a new bot via @BotFather on Telegram to obtain a Bot Token.

4817,Compose/Stitch Separate Images together using n8n & Gemini AI Image Editing,"This n8n template demonstrates how to use AI to compose or ""stitch"" separate images together to generate a new image which retains the source assets and consistent style. Use cases are many: Try producing storyboard scenes with consistent characters, marketing material with existing product assets or trying on different articles on fashion! Good to know At time of writing, each image generated will cost $0.039 USD. See Gemini Pricing for updated info. The model used in this workflow is geo-restricted! If it says model not found, it may not be available in your country or region. How it works We'll import our required assets via our Cloud storage using the HTTP node. The images are then converted to base64 strings and aggregated so we can use it for our AI model. Gemini's image generation model is used which takes all 3 images and a prompt that we define. Our prompt instructs the model on how to compose the final image. Gemini generates a new image but uses the original 3 assets to do so. The consistency to the source images is very high and shows little signs of hallucinations! Gemini's output is base64 so we use a ""Convert to file"" node to convert the data to binary. The final binary image is then uploaded to Google Drive to complete the demonstration. How to use The manual trigger node is used as an example but feel free to replace this with other triggers such as webhook or even a form. Technically, you should be able to compose even more images but of course, the generation will take longer and cost more.

9879,Auto-Send WooCommerce Invoices via WhatsApp with Rapiwa API,"Who is this for? This workflow listens for new or updated WooCommerce orders, cleans and structures the order data, processes orders in batches, and standardizes WhatsApp phone numbers. It verifies phone numbers via the Rapiwa API, sends invoice links or messages to verified numbers, and logs results into separate Google Sheets tabs for verified and unverified numbers. Throttling and looping are managed using batch processing and wait delays. What this Workflow Does Receives order events (e.g., order.updated) from WooCommerce or a similar trigger. Extracts customer, billing/shipping address, product list, and invoice link from the order payload. Processes orders/items in batches for controlled throughput. Cleans and normalizes phone numbers by removing non-digit characters. Verifies whether a phone number is registered on WhatsApp using the Rapiwa API. If verified, sends a personalized message or invoice link via Rapiwa's send-message endpoint. If not verified, logs the customer as unverified in Google Sheets. Logs every send attempt (status and validity) into Google Sheets. Uses Wait nodes and batching to avoid API rate limits. Key Features Trigger-based automation (WooCommerce trigger; adaptable to Shopify webhook). Batch processing using SplitInBatches for stable throughput. Phone number cleaning using JavaScript (waNoStr.replace(/\D/g, """")). Pre-send WhatsApp verification via Rapiwa to reduce failed sends. Conditional branching (IF node) between verified and unverified flows. Personalized message templates that include product and customer fields. Logging to Google Sheets with separate flows for verified/sent and unverified/not sent. Wait node for throttling and looping control. Requirements Running n8n instance with nodes: HTTP Request, Code, SplitInBatches, IF, Google Sheets, Wait, and a WooCommerce trigger (or equivalent). Rapiwa account and Bearer token for verify/send endpoints. Google account and Google Sheets access with OAuth2 credentials. WooCommerce store access credentials (or Shopify credentials if adapting).

2691,Currency Conversion Workflow,"Purpose: This workflow exemplifies a sophisticated yet pragmatic mechanism for automating currency conversions by leveraging simple HTTP queries routed through a webhook. By intercepting user requests, sourcing real-time exchange rate data via Google search results, and formatting the data into actionable responses, it obviates the reliance on third-party APIs. This efficiency renders it an indispensable instrument for diverse applications, including dynamic pricing strategies for AI-driven systems, financial data automation, and real-time currency computation within complex workflows. The workflow's architectural simplicity ensures seamless integration across professional and academic domains, optimizing both scalability and reliability. Workflow Steps: Capture Conversion Query: The workflow initiates by intercepting user input delivered as a GET request through a configured webhook. Inputs should adhere to a structured syntax, such as 5usd to mxn, to ensure flawless processing. Testing Tip: Use tools like Postman or a browser to test GET requests and verify that the Webhook receives inputs correctly. Fetch Exchange Rate: Utilizing the HTTP Request node, a Google search query is executed to retrieve current exchange rate data. This method ensures the workflow remains economical and adaptable while circumventing API dependencies. Extract Conversion Data: By processing the returned HTML from Google's search results, this node extracts precise exchange rate figures and contextual information critical for accurate conversions. Error Handling: If extraction fails, verify that the input format is correct and update CSS selectors to reflect any changes in Google's HTML structure. Format Currency Response: The extracted data undergoes refinement and is formatted into a structured, user-friendly string that conveys the conversion results with clarity and precision. Send Conversion Response: The workflow culminates by dispatching the formatted response back to the request origin, completing the loop with efficiency and reliability. Required Configuration: Configure the Webhook node to accommodate GET requests. The query parameters should follow the format: https://your-webhook-url/currency-converter?q=5usd+to+mxn. Inputs must adhere strictly to the predefined syntax (e.g., 5usd to mxn). Deviations may induce processing errors or yield erroneous outputs. Customization Options: The Extract Conversion Data node’s CSS selectors can be fine-tuned to align with modifications in Google’s HTML structure, ensuring long-term operability. Adjustments to the Format Currency Response node enable bespoke output formatting, incorporating additional metadata or altering the response structure to meet specific project requisites. Advanced Features: This workflow’s modular design supports seamless integration into expansive systems. For instance, an e-commerce platform could employ it to dynamically localize product pricing based on user geolocation. Enhanced functionality can be achieved by appending nodes to log conversions, monitor performance metrics, or trigger auxiliary workflows conditioned on conversion outputs. Expected Results: For a query like 5usd to mxn, the workflow generates a response formatted as: 5 USD = 95 MXN. This output is optimized for readability and practical application. Use Case Examples: AI Integration:** Enables artificial intelligence agents to process real-time price conversions efficiently across diverse currencies, enhancing their computational capabilities. Financial Operations:** Automates precise currency conversions for corporate reports, international transactions, and market analytics.

9974,"Automate HVAC Service Scheduling with AI Agent, Google Calendar and Gmail","Instant, automated scheduling. This AI Scheduling Agent manages real-time appointments, availability checks, and rescheduling across Google Calendar and Sheets, eliminating human hold times. 🎯 Problem Statement Traditional call center or online booking systems often lack the flexibility to handle complex, multi-step customer requests like rescheduling, checking dynamic availability across multiple time slots, or handling context-aware conversational booking. This leads to friction, missed bookings, and high administrative overhead for service companies like HVAC providers. ✨ Solution This workflow deploys a sophisticated AI Scheduling Agent that acts as a virtual receptionist. It uses the Language Model's (LLM) ""tool-use"" capability to intelligently execute complex, sequential business logic (e.g., check availability before booking, find existing events before rescheduling) and manages the entire lifecycle of a service appointment, from initial inquiry to final confirmation. ⚙️ How It Works (Multi-Step Execution) Trigger: A customer request (e.g., from an external voice or text platform) hits the Webhook Trigger with intent details (e.g., tool\_request: 'reschedule\_appointment'). Agent Logic: The Receptionist Agent uses a strict system prompt and its internal tools to formulate an execution plan. It maintains conversational state via the simple-memory node. Tool Execution (Example: Reschedule): The Agent executes a predefined sequence of private tools: find\_old\_event: Locates the existing booking ID using the customer's email. check\_calendar: Verifies the proposed new time is available (2-hour window). reschedule\_appointment: Updates the calendar event. log\_lead: Updates the central Google Sheet. Synchronous Response: The Agent sends a confirmation or follow-up question via the respond\_to\_webhook node. Asynchronous Confirmation: The log\_lead action triggers a secondary workflow that composes a professional email via a second LLM (Anthropic) and sends it to the customer via Gmail, followed by an internal alert via Google Chat. 🛠️ Setup Steps Credentials: AI/LLM: Configure credentials for the Language Model used (OpenAI or Gemini) for the core Agent. Google Services: Set up OAuth2 credentials for Google Calendar (for booking/checking), Google Sheets (for logging), and Gmail (for customer confirmation). Google Calendar: Specify the technician's calendar ID (bhuvaneshx13@gmail.com in the template) in all Calendar nodes. Google Sheets: Create a new Google Sheet to serve as the Lead Log and update the Document ID and Sheet Name in the log\_lead and log\_lead\_trigger nodes. Tool Configuration: Review and customize the Agent's system prompt in the Receptionist node to align time zone rules (currently Asia/Kolkata - IST) and business hours (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM) with your operations. ✅ Benefits Increased Efficiency: Fully automates complex scheduling and rescheduling, freeing up human staff. Contextual Service: AI handles multi-turn conversations and adheres to strict business rules (e.g., 2-hour slots, maximum tool usage). Data Integrity: Ensures all bookings are immediately logged to Google Sheets, maintaining a centralized record (CRM). Professional Flow: Provides immediate confirmation to the customer via email and instant notification to the internal team via chat. 🚀 Other Use Cases The underlying multi-step, tool-execution pattern is highly versatile and can be adapted for any service industry requiring complex, rules-based scheduling: Real Estate:** Scheduling property viewings (Check agent availability → Book viewing → Send directions). HVAC Services:** Managing maintenance and repair visits (Diagnose issue type → Match with qualified technician → Check part availability → Schedule visit → Send service confirmation). Medical/Dental:** Booking patient appointments (Check insurance eligibility → Check doctor availability → Book → Send pre-visit forms). Legal Services:** Intake for consultations (Collect client issue → Check specialist availability → Book → Send retainer agreement). Automotive Repair:** Scheduling service bays (Check bay and mechanic availability → Book → Update internal service board).",741,2025-10-21 09:41:32.806000+00:00,True,7

Secure & Customizable**: Uses API credentials and configurable chunk size, collection name, etc. How It Works Document Processing & Vectorization The workflow retrieves documents from a specified Google Drive folder. Each file is downloaded, split into chunks (using a recursive text splitter), and converted into embeddings via OpenAI. The embeddings, along with metadata (file ID and name), are stored in a Qdrant vector database under the collection negozio-emporio-verde. Query Handling & Response Generation When a user submits a chat message, the workflow: Embeds the query using OpenAI. Retrieves the top 5 relevant document chunks from Qdrant. Uses Google Gemini to generate a response based on the retrieved context. Aggregates and deduplicates the source file names from the retrieved chunks. The final output includes both the AI-generated response and a list of source documents (e.g., Sources: [""FAQ.pdf"", ""Policy.txt""]). Set Up Steps Configure Qdrant Collection Replace QDRANTURL and COLLECTION in the ""Create collection"" HTTP node to initialize the Qdrant collection with: Vector size: 1536 (OpenAI embedding dimension). Distance metric: Cosine. Ensure the ""Clear collection"" node is configured to reset the collection if needed. Google Drive & OpenAI Integration Link the Google Drive node to the target folder (Test Negozio in this example). Verify OpenAI and Google Gemini API credentials are correctly set in their respective nodes. Metadata & Output Customization Adjust the ""Aggregate"" and ""Response"" nodes if additional metadata fields are needed. Modify the ""Output"" node to format the response (e.g., changing Sources: {{...}} to match your preferred style). Testing Trigger the workflow manually to test document ingestion. Use the chat interface to verify responses include accurate source attribution. Note: Replace placeholder values (e.g., QDRANTURL) with actual endpoints before deployment. Need help customizing?

2485,Automate Droplet Snapshots on DigitalOcean,"This workflow automates the management of DigitalOcean Droplet snapshots by listing all droplets, filtering based on the number of snapshots, and deleting excess snapshots before creating new ones. It ensures your droplet snapshots stay organized and within a manageable limit, preventing unnecessary storage costs due to an excess of snapshots. Who is this for? This workflow is perfect for users managing DigitalOcean Droplets and looking to automate the process of snapshot creation and cleanup to save on storage costs and maintain efficient resource management. It’s useful for DevOps teams, cloud administrators, or any developer leveraging DigitalOcean for their infrastructure. What problem is this workflow solving? When managing multiple DigitalOcean Droplets, snapshots can quickly accumulate, taking up space and increasing storage costs. Manually deleting and creating snapshots can be time-consuming and inefficient. This automation solves this problem by automating the snapshot management process, ensuring that no more than a defined number of snapshots are kept per droplet. What this workflow does Runs every 48 hours: The workflow is triggered by a cron node that runs every 48 hours, ensuring timely snapshot management. List all droplets: The workflow retrieves all droplets in the DigitalOcean account. Retrieve snapshots: For each droplet, the workflow retrieves a list of existing snapshots. Filter snapshots: If the number of snapshots exceeds 4, the workflow filters for snapshots that need to be deleted. Delete snapshots: Excess snapshots are automatically deleted based on the filter criteria. Create new snapshot: After cleaning up, the workflow creates a new snapshot for each droplet, ensuring that backups are always up-to-date. Setup DigitalOcean API Key: You’ll need to configure the HTTP Request nodes with your DigitalOcean API key. This key is required for authenticating requests to list droplets, retrieve snapshots, delete snapshots, and create new ones. Snapshot Threshold: By default, the workflow is set to keep no more than 4 snapshots per droplet. This can be adjusted by modifying the filter node conditions. Set Execution Frequency: The cron node is set to run every 48 hours, but you can adjust the timing to suit your needs. How to customize this workflow Adjust Snapshot Limit**: Change the value in the filter node if you want to keep more or fewer snapshots. Modify Run Frequency**: The workflow runs every 48 hours by default. You can change the frequency in the cron node to run more or less often. Enhance with Notifications**: You can add a notification node (e.g., Slack or email) to alert you when snapshots are deleted or created. Workflow Summary This workflow automates the management of DigitalOcean Droplet snapshots by keeping the number of snapshots under a defined limit, deleting the oldest ones, and ensuring new snapshots are created at regular intervals.",615,2024-10-23 13:17:02.170000+00:00,False,1

5014,End of Turn Detection for smoother AI agent chats with Telegram and Gemini,"This n8n template demonstrates one approach to achieve a more natural and less frustration conversations with AI agents by reducing interrupts by predicting the end of user utterances. When we text or chat casually, it's not uncommon to break our sentences over multiple messages or when it comes to voice, break our speech with the odd pause or umms and ahhs. If an agent replies to every message, it's likely to interrupt us before we finish our thoughts and it can get very annoying! Previously, I demonstrated a simple technique for buffering each incoming message by 5 seconds but that approach still suffers in some scenarios when more time is needed. This technique has no arbitrary time limit and instead uses AI to figure out when its the agent's turn based on the user's message, allowing for the user to take all the time they need. How it works Telegram messages are received but no reply is generated for them by default. Instead they are sent to the prediction subworkflow to determine if a reply should be generated. The prediction subworkflow begins by checking Redis for the current user's prediction session state. If this is a new ""utterance"", it kicks off the ""predict end of utterance"" loop - the purpose of which is to buffer messages in a smart way! New users message can continue to be accepted by the workflow until enough is collected to allow our prediction classifier to determine the end of the utterance has been reached. The loop is then broken and the buffered chat messages are combined and sent to the AI agent to generate a response and sent to the user via the telegram node. The prediction session state is then deleted to signal the workflow is ready to start again with a new message. How to use This system sits between your preferred chat platform and the AI agent so all you need to do is replace the telegram nodes as required. Where LLM-only prediction isn't working well enough, consider more traditional code-based checking of heuristics to improve the detection. Ideally you'll want a fast but accurate LLM so your user isn't waiting longer than they have to - at time of writing Gemini-2.5-flash-lite was the fastest in testing but keep a look out for smaller and more powerful LLMs in the future.

5160,🤖 Build Resilient AI Workflows with Automatic GPT and Gemini Failover Chain,"This workflow contains community nodes that are only compatible with the self-hosted version of n8n. How it works This workflow demonstrates how to create a resilient AI Agent that automatically falls back to a different language model if the primary one fails. This is useful for handling API errors, rate limits, or model outages without interrupting your process. State Initialization: The Agent Variables node initializes a fail_count to 0. This counter tracks how many models have been attempted. Dynamic Model Selection: The Fallback Models (a LangChain Code node) acts as a router. It receives a list of all connected AI models and, based on the current fail_count, selects which one to use for this attempt (0 for the first model, 1 for the second, etc.). Agent Execution: The AI Agent node attempts to run your prompt using the model selected by the router. The Fallback Loop: On Success: The workflow completes successfully. On Error: If the AI Agent node fails, its ""On Error"" output is triggered. This path loops back to the Agent Variables node, which increments the fail_count by 1. The process then repeats, causing the Fallback Models router to select the next model in the list. Final Failure: If all connected models are tried and fail, the workflow will stop with an error. Set up steps Setup time: ~3-5 minutes Configure Credentials: Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., for OpenAI, Google AI) configured in your n8n instance. Define Your Model Chain: Add the AI model nodes you want to use to the canvas (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic). Connect them to the Fallback Models node. Important: The order in which you connect the models determines the fallback order. The model nodes first created/connected will be tried first. Set Your Prompt: Open the AI Agent node and enter the prompt you want to execute. Test: Run the workflow. To test the fallback logic, you can temporarily disable the First Model node or configure it with invalid credentials to force an error.",411,2025-06-23 16:33:43.301000+00:00,True,4

Switch Node: deep → MCP Firecrawler (AI Agent). basic → Crawl and Scrape node. Scraping & Extraction: Deep path: Firecrawler → JSON structure. Basic path: Crawlee → Mistral extractor → JSON. Storage: Save JSON to Supabase. Archive in Google Drive. Competitor Analysis (Deep Only): Finds competitors via Tavily. Saves to Supabase competitors table. End: Finishes with a No Operation node. How To Set Up Import workflow JSON. Install community nodes (especially n8n-nodes-crawl-and-scrape from npm). Configure credentials (Supabase, Mistral AI, Google Drive). Add your Tavily API key. Connect Supabase and Drive nodes properly. Fix disconnected “basic” path if needed. Activate workflow. Test via the webhook form URL. How To Customize Change LLMs:** Swap Mistral for OpenAI or Claude. Edit Scraper Prompts:** Modify system prompts in AI agent nodes. Change Extraction Schema:** Update JSON Schema in extractor nodes. Fix Relational Tables:** Add Items node before Supabase inserts for arrays (social links, keywords). Enhance Automation:** Add email/slack notifications, or replace form trigger with a Google Sheets trigger. Add-ons Automated Trigger:** Run on new sheet rows. Notifications:** Email or Slack alerts after completion. RAG Integration:** Use the Supabase database as a chatbot knowledge source.

3282,Create Notes and Comments on Any Odoo Model Record,"Introduction This workflow is designed to create and attach notes or comments to any record in your Odoo instance. It acts as a sub-workflow that can be triggered by a main workflow to log messages or comments in a centralized manner. By leveraging the powerful Odoo API, this template ensures that updates to records are handled efficiently, providing an organized way to document important information related to your business processes. Setup Instructions Import the Workflow: Import the provided JSON file into your n8n instance. Odoo Credentials: Ensure you have valid Odoo API credentials (e.g., ""Roodsys Odoo Automation Account"") configured in n8n. Node Configuration: Verify that the ""Odoo"" node (consider renaming it to ""Odoo Record Manager"" for clarity) is set up with your server details and authentication parameters. Check that the workflow trigger (""When Executed by Another Workflow"") is configured to receive input parameters from the parent workflow. Execution Trigger: This workflow is designed to be initiated by another workflow. Make sure the main workflow supplies the required inputs. Workflow Details Trigger Node: The workflow begins with the ""When Executed by Another Workflow"" node, which accepts three inputs: rec_id: A numeric identifier for the Odoo record. message: The text of the comment or note. model: The specific Odoo model (e.g., rs.deployment.action.log) where the note should be attached. Odoo Node: The second node in the workflow calls the Odoo API to create a new log message. It maps the inputs as follows: message_type is set to ""comment"". model is assigned the provided model name. res_id is assigned the record ID (rec_id). body is assigned the message content. Additional Information: A sticky note node is included to provide a brief overview of the workflow’s purpose directly within the interface. Input Parameters Record ID (rec_id): The unique identifier of the record in Odoo where the note will be added. Message (message): The content of the comment or note that is to be logged. Model (model): The Odoo model name indicating the context in which the note should be created (e.g., rs.deployment.action.log). Usage Examples Internal Logging: Use the workflow to attach internal comments or logs to specific records, such as customer profiles, orders, or deployment logs. Audit Trails: Create a comprehensive audit trail by documenting changes or important events in Odoo records. Integration with Other Workflows: Link this workflow with other automation processes in n8n (like email notifications, data synchronization, or reporting) to create a seamless integration across your systems. Pre-conditions The Odoo instance must be accessible and correctly configured. API permissions and user roles should be validated to ensure that the workflow has the necessary access rights. The workflow expects inputs from an external trigger or parent workflow. Customization & Integration This template offers several customization options to tailor it to your needs: Field Customization: Modify or add new fields to match your logging or commenting requirements. Node Renaming: Rename nodes for better clarity and consistency within your workflow ecosystem. Integration Possibilities: Easily integrate this workflow with other processes in n8n, such as triggering notifications or synchronizing data across different systems. This sub-workflow receives data from a main workflow (for example, a record ID, a message, and the Odoo model) and creates a new note (or comment) in the corresponding Odoo record. Essentially, it acts as a centralized point for logging comments or notes in a specific Odoo model, ensuring that the information remains organized and easy to track.

Items from the feed are split into individual entries using the Split Out node. Scrape Article Content Each article URL is sent to the Firecrawl API with a prompt to extract only the main content in Markdown. The scraping skips navigation, headers, footers, and ads. Convert and Save The extracted Markdown is converted into a .md file using the Convert to File node. The file is then uploaded to a Google Drive folder. Good to Know This workflow uses the Firecrawl API for web scraping. Be sure to configure a Generic HTTP Header credential with your API key. Output files are saved in Markdown format You can add more Schedule Trigger + HTTP Request pairs to extend this workflow to additional feeds. Requirements Firecrawl API account for scraping Google Drive account (OAuth2 credentials must be configured in n8n) n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud) Customization Ideas Replace or extend RSS feeds with sources relevant to your niche Load up scraped news stories into a prompt to create new content like TikToks and Reels Add a summarization step using an LLM like GPT or Claude Send the Markdown files to Notion, Slack, or a blog CMS Example Feeds | Feed Name | URL | |------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------| | Google News (AI) | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/AkOariu1C7YyUUMv.json | | OpenAI Blog | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/xNVg2hbY14Z7Gpva.json | | Hugging Face | https://rss.app/feeds/v1.1/sgHcE2ehHQMTWhrL.json |",191,2025-06-27 19:09:44.689000+00:00,True,2
6307,Google Maps Lead Generation with Apify & Email Extraction for Airtable,"🧠 What It Does This n8n workflow collects leads from Google Maps, scrapes their websites via direct HTTP requests, and extracts valid email addresses — all while mimicking real user behavior to improve scraping reliability. It rotates User-Agent headers, introduces randomized delays, and refines URLs by removing only query parameters and fragments to preserve valid page paths (like social media links). The workflow blends Apify actors, raw HTTP requests, HTML-to-Markdown conversion, and smart email extraction to deliver clean, actionable lead data — ready to be sent to Airtable, Google Sheets, or any CRM. Perfect for lean, scalable B2B lead generation using n8n’s native logic and no external scrapers. 💡Why this workflow Modest lead scrapers rely on heavy tools or APIs like Firecrawl. This workflow: Uses lightweight HTTP requests (with randomized user-agents) to scrape websites. Adds natural wait times to avoid rate limits and IP bans. Avoid full-page crawlers, yet still pulls emails effectively. Works great for freelancers, marketers, or teams targeting niche B2B leads. Designed for stealth and resilience. 👤 Who it’s for Lead generation freelancers or consultants. B2B marketers looking to extract real contact info. Small businesses doing targeted outreach. Developers who want a fast, low-footprint scraper. Anyone who wants email + website leads from Google Maps. ⚙️ How It Works 1. 📥 Form Submission (Lead Input) A Form Trigger collects: Keyword Location No. of Leads (defaults to 10) This makes the workflow dynamic and user-friendly — ready for multiple use cases and teams. 2. 📊 Scrape Business Info (via Apify) Apify’s Google Maps Actor searches for matching businesses. The Dataset Node fetches all relevant business details. A Set Node parses key fields like name, phone, website, and category. A Limit Node ensures the workflow only processes the desired number of leads. 3. 🔁 First Loop – Visit & Scrape Website Each business website is processed in a loop. A Code Node cleans the website URL by removing only query parameters/fragments — keeping full paths like /contact. A HTTP Request Node fetches the raw HTML of the site: Uses randomized User-Agent headers (5 variants) to mimic real devices and browsers. This makes requests appear more human and reduces the risk of detection or blocking. HTML is converted to Markdown using the Markdown Node, making it easier to scan for text patterns. A Wait Node introduces a random delay between 2-7 seconds: Helps avoid triggering rate limits, Reduces likelihood of being flagged as a bot. A Merge Node combines scraped markdown + lead info for use in the second loop. 4. 🔁 Second Loop – Extract Emails In this second loop, the markdown data is processed. A Code Node applies regex to extract the first valid email address. If no email is found, ""N/A"" is returned. A brief 1 second Wait Node simulates realistic browsing time. Another Merge Node attaches the email result to the original lead data. 5. ✅ Filter, Clean & Store A Filter Node removes all entries with ""N/A"" or invalid email results. A Set Node ensures only required fields (like website, email, and company name) are passed forward. The clean leads are saved to Airtable (or optionally, Google Sheets) using an upsert-style insert to avoid duplicates. 🛡️ Anti-Flagging Design This workflow is optimized for stealth: No scraping tools or headless browsers (like Puppeteer or Firecrawl). Direct HTTP requests with rotating User-Agents. Randomized wait intervals (2-7s). Only non-intrusive parsing — no automation footprints. 🛠 How to Set It Up Open n8n (Cloud or Self-Hosted). Install Apify node search Apify and click on Install. Do this before importing your file. Import the provided .json file into your n8n editor. Set up the required credentials: 🔑 Apify API Key** (used for Google Maps scraping) 🔑 Airtable API Key** (or connect Google Sheets instead) Recommended Prepare your Airtable base or Google Sheet with fields like: Email, Website, Phone, Company Name. Review the Set node if you'd like to collect more fields from Apify (e.g., Ratings, Categories, etc.). 🔁 Customization Tips The Apify scraper returns rich business data. By default, this workflow collects name, phone, and website — but you can add more in the ""Grab Desired Fields"" node. Need safer scraping at scale? Swap the HTTP Request for Firecrawl’s Single URL scraper (or any headless service like Browserless, Oxylabs, Bright Date, or ScrapingBee) — they handle rendering and IP rotation. Want to extract from internal pages (like /contact or /about)? Use Firecrawl’s async crawl mode — just note it takes longer. For speed and efficiency, this built-in HTTP + Markdown setup is usually the fastest way to grab emails.",189,2025-07-23 06:50:51.634000+00:00,False,3

10067,Automate Video Story Publishing to Facebook Page using Google Drive and Sheets,"Automated Facebook Page Story Video Publisher (Google Drive → Facebook → Google Sheet) &gt; Recommended: Self-hosted via tino.vn/vps-n8n?affid=388 — use code VPSN8N for up to 39% off. This workflow is an automated solution for publishing video content from Google Drive to your Facebook Page Stories, while using Google Sheets as a posting queue manager. What This Workflow Does (Workflow Function) This automation orchestrates a complete multi-step process for uploading and publishing videos to Facebook Stories: Queue Management: Every 2 hours and 30 minutes, the workflow checks a Google Sheet (Get Row Sheet node) to find the first video whose Stories column is empty — meaning it hasn’t been posted yet. Conditional Execution: An If node confirms that the video’s File ID exists before proceeding. Video Retrieval: Using the File ID, the workflow downloads the video from Google Drive (Google Drive node) and calculates its binary size (Set to the total size in bytes node). Facebook 3-Step Upload: It performs the Facebook Graph API’s three-step upload process through HTTP Request nodes: Step 1 – Initialize Session: Starts an upload session and retrieves the upload_url and video_id. Step 2 – Upload File: Uploads the binary video data to the provided upload_url. Step 3 – Publish Video: Finalizes and publishes the uploaded video as a Facebook Story. Status Update: Once completed, the workflow updates the same row in Google Sheets (Update upload status in sheet node) using the row_number to mark the video as processed. Prerequisites (What You Need Before Running) 1. n8n Instance &gt; Recommended: Self-hosted via tino.vn/vps-n8n?affid=388 — use code VPSN8N for up to 39% off. 2. Google Services Google Drive Credentials:** OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive to let n8n download video files. Google Sheets Credentials:** OAuth2 credentials for Google Sheets to read the posting queue and update statuses. Google Sheet:** A spreadsheet (ID: 1RnE5O06l7W6TLCLKkwEH5Oyl-EZ3OE-Uc3OWFbDohYI) containing: File ID — the video’s unique ID in Google Drive. Stories — posting status column (leave empty for pending videos). row_number — used for updating the correct row after posting. 3. Facebook Setup Page ID:** Your Facebook Page ID (currently hardcoded as 115432036514099 in the info node). Access Token:* A *Page Access Token** with permissions such as pages_manage_posts and pages_read_engagement. This token is hardcoded in the info node and again in Step 3. Post video. Usage Guide and Implementation Notes How to Use Queue Videos: Add video entries to your Google Sheet. Each entry must include a valid Google Drive File ID. Leave the Stories column empty for videos that haven’t been posted. Activate: Save and activate the workflow. The Schedule Trigger will automatically handle new uploads every 2 hours and 30 minutes. Implementation Notes ⚠️ Token Security:* Hardcoding your *Access Token* inside the info node is *not recommended**. Tokens expire and expose your Page to risk if leaked. 👉 Action: Replace the static token with a secure Credential setup that supports token rotation. Loop Efficiency:* The *“false”** output of the If node currently loops back to the Get Row Sheet node. This creates unnecessary cycles if no videos are found. 👉 Action: Disconnect that branch so the workflow stops gracefully when no unposted videos remain. Status Updates:* To prevent re-posting the same video, the final Update upload status in sheet node must update the *Stories** column (e.g., write ""POSTED""). 👉 Action: Add this mapping explicitly to your Google Sheets node. Automated File ID Sync:** This workflow assumes that the Google Sheet already contains valid File IDs. 👉 You can build a secondary workflow (using Schedule Trigger1 → Search files and folders → Append or update row in sheet) to automatically populate new video File IDs from your Google Drive. ✅ Result Once active, this workflow automatically: pulls pending videos from your Google Sheet, uploads them to Facebook Stories, and marks them as posted — all without manual intervention.",153,2025-10-23 02:34:17.108000+00:00,False,4

How it works / What it does A Webhook receives a plain-language request (e.g. “Create a newsletter about XYZ and store it in SharePoint”). The Webhook can be changed to another trigger, fr example Manual Trigger. An AI Agent (OpenAI GPT-4o) drafts German & English newsletter copy following a strict JSON schema. SharePoint fetches an HTML template; a Code node injects AI copy into the placeholders. Optional creative assets: Pollinations AI → image (resolution check & frame overlay) FAL AI → short video + Lyria2 audio → merged via FFmpeg API A Gmail Approval step sends the draft to an approver; the flow continues only on “Approve”. Depending on user intent the workflow: Emails the newsletter to HubSpot contacts, and/or Saves HTML (+ JPG/Video URL) to a SharePoint library.

5461,iMessage Food Photo Nutritional Analysis with GPT-4 Vision & Memory Storage,"iMessage AI-Powered Smart Calorie Tracker &gt; 📌 What it looks like in use: &gt; This image shows a visual of the workflow in action. Use it for reference when replicating or customizing the template. This n8n template transforms a user-submitted food photo into a detailed, friendly, AI-generated nutritional report — sent back seamlessly as a chat message. It combines OpenAI's visual reasoning, Postgres-based memory, and real-time messaging with Blooio to create a hands-free calorie and nutrition tracker. 🧠 Use Cases Auto-analyze meals based on user-uploaded images. Daily/weekly/monthly diet summaries with no manual input. Virtual food journaling integrated into messaging apps. Nutrition companion for healthcare, fitness, and wellness apps. 📌 Good to Know ⚠️ This uses GPT-4 with image capabilities, which may incur higher usage costs depending on your OpenAI pricing tier. Review OpenAI’s pricing. The model uses visual reasoning and estimation to determine nutritional info — results are estimates and should not replace medical advice. Blooio is used for sending/receiving messages. You will need a valid API key and project set up with webhook delivery. A Postgres database is required for long-term memory (optional but recommended). You can use any memory node with it. ⚙️ How It Works Webhook Trigger The workflow begins when a message is received via Blooio. This webhook listens for user-submitted content, including any image attachments. Image Validation and Extraction A conditional check verifies the presence of attachments. If images are found, their URLs are extracted using a Code node and prepared for processing. Image Analysis via AI Agent Images are passed to an OpenAI-based agent using a custom system prompt that: Identifies the meal, Estimates portion sizes, Calculates calories, macros, fiber, sugar, and sodium, Scores the meal with a health and confidence rating, Responds in a chatty, human-like summary format. Memory Integration A Postgres memory node stores user interactions for recall and contextual continuity, allowing day/week/month reports to be generated based on cumulative messages. Response Aggregation & Summary Messages are aggregated and summarized by a second AI agent into a single concise message to be sent back to the user via Blooio. Message Dispatch The final message is posted back to the originating conversation using the Blooio Send Message API. 🚀 How to Use The included webhook can be triggered manually or programmatically by linking Blooio to a frontend chat UI. You can test the flow using a manual POST request containing mock Blooio payloads. Want to use a different messages app? Replace the Blooio nodes with your preferred messaging API (e.g., Twilio, Slack, Telegram). ✅ Requirements OpenAI API access with GPT-4 Vision or equivalent multimodal support. Blooio account with access to incoming and outgoing message APIs. Optional: Postgres DB (e.g., via Neon) for tracking message context over time. 🛠️ Customising This Workflow Prompt Tuning** Tailor the system prompt in the AI Agent node to fit specific diets (e.g., keto, diabetic), age groups, or regionally-specific foods. Analytics Dashboards** Hook up your Postgres memory to a data visualization tool for nutritional trends over time. Multilingual Support** Adjust the response prompt to translate messages into other languages or regional dialects. Image Preprocessing** Insert a preprocessing node before sending images to the model to resize, crop, or enhance clarity for better results.",141,2025-06-30 00:28:05.321000+00:00,True,5

7678,Create Dynamic Crypto Market Monitors with Gemini AI and Telegram Bot,"Template Description This description details the template's purpose, how it works, and its key features. You can copy and use it directly. Overview This is a powerful n8n ""meta-workflow"" that acts as a Supervisor. Through a simple Telegram bot, you can dynamically create, manage, and delete countless independent, AI-driven market monitoring agents (Watchdogs). This template is a perfect implementation of the ""Workflowception"" (workflow managing workflows) concept in n8n, showcasing how to achieve ultimate automation by leveraging the the n8n API. How It Works ? Telegram Bot Interface: Execute all operations by sending commands to your own Telegram Bot: /add SYMBOL INTERVAL PROMPT: Add a new monitoring task. /delete SYMBOL: Delete an existing monitoring task. /list: List all currently running monitoring tasks. /help: Get help information. Use Telegram Bot to control The watchdog workfolw created in the below Dynamic Workflow Management: Upon receiving an /add command, the Supervisor system reads a ""Watchdog"" template, fills in your provided parameters (like trading pair and time interval), and then automatically creates a brand new, independent workflow via the n8n API and activates it. Persistent Storage: All monitoring tasks are stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring your configurations are safe even if n8n restarts. The ID of each newly created workflow is also written back to the database to facilitate future deletion operations. AI-Powered Analysis: Each created ""Watchdog"" workflow runs on schedule. It fetches the latest candlestick chart by calling a self-hosted tradingview-snapshot service. This service, available at https://github.com/0xcathiefish/tradingview-snapshot, works by simulating a login to your account and then using TradingView's official snapshot feature to generate an unrestricted, high-quality chart image. An example of a generated snapshot can be seen here: https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uvxylM1Z.png. To use this, you need to download the Docker image from the packages in the GitHub repository mentioned above, and run it as a container. The n8n workflow then communicates directly with this container via an HTTP API to request and receive the chart snapshot. After obtaining the image, the workflow calls a multimodal AI model (Gemini). It sends both the chart image and your custom text-based conditions (e.g., ""breakout above previous high on high volume"" or ""break below 4-hour MA20"") to the AI for analysis, enabling truly intelligent chart interpretation and alert triggering. Key Features Workflowception: A prime example of one workflow using an API to create, activate, and delete other workflows. Full Control via Telegram: Manage your monitoring bots from anywhere, anytime, without needing to log into the n8n interface. AI Visual Analysis: Move beyond simple price alerts. Let an AI ""read"" the charts for you to enable complex, pattern-based, and indicator-based intelligent alerts. Persistent & Extensible: Built on PostgreSQL for stability and reliability. You can easily add more custom commands.",98,2025-08-21 03:46:49.403000+00:00,True,4

9393,"Automate B2B Lead Generation & Personalized Cold Emails with Apollo, Apify & GPT","This n8n template automates targeted lead discovery, AI-driven data structuring, and personalized cold-email sending at controlled intervals. It’s ideal for sales teams, founders, and agencies that want to scale outreach without losing personalization. Good to know Can run on an interval (e.g., every 10 minutes) to fetch and process new leads. Requires API keys for OpenAI (content + parsing) and Apify (lead discovery). Emails are sent one-by-one with delays (the Wait node) to reduce spam risk. Lead data is written to Google Sheets—we recommend separate sheets for leads with and without emails. Works with Gmail, Outlook, or your own SMTP—just plug in your credentials. How it works Form Trigger (START) A form collects: Job Title, Company Size, Keywords, Location. Apollo URL Generator (GPT) The model turns the form fields into a precise Apollo search URL. Run Apify (Actor) Apify fetches contacts/companies that match your preferences for downstream processing. Limit Caps how many records are prepared per run (e.g., max 5). Parse Lead Data (GPT) Extracts key fields (full name, email, title, LinkedIn, company, company links). Synthesizes a short 2–3 sentence sales-ready summary for each lead. Sorting (If) Splits leads into with email vs. without email. With email → main sheet + email pathway Without email → a separate sheet for later enrichment Email Magic (GPT) Uses the parsed data to personalize your fixed email template for each lead (keeps structure/intent, swaps in the right details). Sending Emails (Loop + Wait + Sender) Loop Over sends messages individually. Wait inserts a pause between sends (fully configurable). Delivery via Gmail or SMTP (custom domain / Outlook). Confirmation After the loop finishes, a Gmail node sends a “campaign complete” confirmation. How to use Enable the workflow and open the start form. Enter preferences: job title, company size, keywords, location. Add credentials: OpenAI (for parsing + email generation) Apify (Bearer token in Run Apify) Google (Sheets + optionally Gmail) SMTP/Outlook (if not using Gmail) Set limits (the Limit node) and send interval (the Wait node). Choose sheets for leads with/without email. Run—the workflow will fetch leads, prepare emails, and send them with spacing. Requirements OpenAI API key Apify API token (access to the chosen Actor) Google Sheets for storage Gmail or SMTP/Outlook credentials for sending An operational n8n instance Customising this workflow Email template: Edit the text in “Creating a email” while preserving placeholders. Segmentation: Add more conditions (role, industry, country) and route to different templates/sheets. Follow-ups: Add a second loop that reads statuses and sends timed reminders. Data enrichment: Insert additional APIs before “Parse Lead Data.” Anti-spam: Increase Wait duration, rotate senders, vary subject lines. Reporting: Add a “send status” sheet and an error log. Security & compliance tips Store API keys in n8n Credentials, not plain-text nodes. Respect GDPR/opt-out—track source and first-contact date in your sheet. Start with a small batch, validate deliverability, then scale up. In short Automated lead capture → AI cleaning + summary → personalized emails → spaced sending → completion notice. Scalable, customizable, and ready to plug into your preferred sender and template.",96,2025-10-09 05:06:36.883000+00:00,True,8

8003,Google Maps to Airtable Lead Scraper with GPT Contact Extraction from Impressum,"How it Works This workflow automates the process of discovering companies in different cities, extracting their contact data, and storing it in Airtable. City Loop (Airtable → Google Maps API) Reads a list of cities from Airtable. Uses each city combined with a search term (e.g., SEO Agency, Berlin) to query Google Maps. Marks processed cities as “checked” to allow safe restarts if interrupted. Business Discovery & Deduplication Searches for businesses via Google Maps Text Search. Checks Airtable to avoid scraping the same company multiple times. Fetches detailed info for each business via Google Maps Place Details API. Impressum Extraction (Website → HTML Parsing) Builds an Impressum page URL for each business. Requests the HTML and cleans out ads, headers, footers, etc. Extracts relevant contact info using an AI extractor (OpenAI node). Contact Information Extraction Pulls out: Decision Maker (Name + Position in one string, if available). Email address (must be valid, containing @). Phone number (international format if possible). Filters out incomplete results (e.g., empty email). Database Storage Writes company data back into Airtable: Company name Address Website Email Phone number Decision Maker (Name + Position) Search term & city used Setup Steps 1. Prerequisites Google Maps API Key with access to: Places API → Text Search + Place Details Airtable base with at least two tables: Cities (with columns: ID, City, Country, Status) Companies (for scraped results) OpenAI API key (for decision maker + contact extraction). 2. Authentication Configure your Airtable API credentials in n8n. Set up HTTP Query Auth with your Google Maps API key. Add your OpenAI API key in the OpenAI Chat node. 3. Configuration In the Airtable “Cities” table, list all cities you want to scrape. Define your search term in the “Execute Workflow” node (e.g., SEO Agency). Adjust the batch sizes and wait intervals if you want faster/slower scraping (Google API has strict rate limits). 4. Execution Start manually or from another workflow. The workflow will scrape all companies in each city step by step. It can be safely stopped and resumed — cities already marked as processed will be skipped. 5. Results Enriched company dataset stored in Airtable, ready for CRM import, lead generation, or further automation. Tips & Notes Always respect GDPR and local laws when handling scraped data. The workflow is modular → you can swap Airtable with Google Sheets, Notion, or a database of your choice. Add custom filters to limit results (e.g., only companies with websites). Use sticky notes inside the workflow to understand each step (mandatory for template publishing). Keep an eye on Google Places API costs** — queries are billed after the free quota.

6333,Automatic Email Unsubscribe Handler: Outlook to BigQuery Integration,"🚫 Email Unsubscribe Handler for Outlook Description This n8n workflow automatically scans recent email replies from your Outlook inbox and identifies unsubscribe requests. If a contact replies with any variation of ""unsubscribe"" within the past 7 days, the system performs two key actions: Saves the contact’s email address in a BigQuery unsubscribes table (for compliance and tracking). Deletes that contact from the active leads table in BigQuery (to stop future outreach). This flow can be triggered on a schedule (e.g. every 4 hours) or run manually as needed. Key Features 📥 Email Parsing from Outlook: Automatically monitors for replies that contain unsubscribe language. 🧠 Smart Filtering: Captures unsubscribes based on message content, not just subject lines. 🔄 BigQuery Integration: Logs unsubscribed emails and removes them from your leads dataset. 🤝 Connect with Me Description I’m Robert Breen, founder of Ynteractive — a consulting firm that helps businesses automate operations using n8n, AI agents, and custom workflows.

10750,"Automate Blog-to-Social Media with GPT-4 for LinkedIn, X, and Reddit","Turn your blog into a set-and-forget content engine: every new article is instantly repurposed into channel-specific social posts with visuals, keeping your brand visible on LinkedIn, X, and Reddit without extra copywriting time. Perfect for lean marketing teams who want consistent, always-on distribution from a single source of content. How it works • Watches your blog RSS feed (or receives a single URL) and detects new articles. • Saves each post in Postgres so every article is only processed once. • Fetches the article HTML, extracts the main body content and sends it to OpenAI (GPT-4.1). • OpenAI creates platform-optimized copy: 1 LinkedIn post, 1 X/Twitter post, 1 Reddit post + image prompts. • Generates on-brand images with OpenAI and publishes everything automatically to LinkedIn, X, and Reddit. • You can also trigger it manually or via webhook whenever you want to push a specific campaign. Setup Steps • Time: around 20–40 minutes for someone familiar with n8n and the platforms. • Create a Postgres table “rss_items” with fields: guid (PRIMARY KEY), title, link, published_at. • Add credentials in n8n for: – Postgres – OpenAI – LinkedIn OAuth2 – X/Twitter OAuth2 + OAuth1 (for media upload) – Reddit OAuth2 • In the RSS node, set your blog feed URL (for example: https://yourblog.com/feed). • In the webhook node, confirm the URL/path you want external tools or other workflows to call with a “link” field. • Run the manual trigger with one test blog URL to verify: – Article content is extracted correctly. – AI returns LinkedIn/X/Reddit posts and image prompts. – Posts and images appear correctly on all social accounts. • Once tests look good, enable the Schedule Trigger so Blog2Social AI runs automatically at your chosen interval.",28,2025-11-12 09:24:53.723000+00:00,True,7

7291,"Full-Cycle Invoice Automation: Airtable, QuickBooks & Stripe","This n8n template from Intuz provides a complete and automated solution for full-cycle invoicing, orchestrating a seamless flow between Airtable, QuickBooks, and Stripe. This is the ultimate sales-to-cash automation. When a deal in Airtable is marked ""Approved for Invoicing,"" this workflow intelligently syncs customer data across QuickBooks and Stripe (creating them if they don't exist), generates an official QuickBooks invoice, creates a Stripe payment link, and then updates the original Airtable record with all the new IDs and links. Eliminate manual data entry and keep your systems perfectly in sync. Who's this workflow for? Finance, Accounting, and Operations Teams SalesOps and RevOps Teams Small Business Owners and Founders Agencies and Freelancers How It Works: 1. Airtable Trigger & Approval Gate: The workflow starts when a record in your Airtable base is updated. An If node immediately checks if the Status field is set to ""Approved for Invoicing."" If not, the workflow for that item stops. 2. Customer Sync (QuickBooks & Stripe): The workflow searches for the customer in both QuickBooks and Stripe using the details from Airtable. Using If nodes, it intelligently checks if the customer exists. If a customer is not found in either platform, it creates a new one. This ""find-or-create"" logic prevents duplicate records. 3. Update Airtable with IDs: Once the customer IDs from both QuickBooks and Stripe are secured (either found or newly created), the workflow updates the original Airtable record with these new IDs for future reference. 4. Generate Financials: Stripe Payment Link: It sends an HTTP request to Stripe to create a unique, ready-to-use payment link for the specified amount. QuickBooks Invoice: It fetches your product list from QuickBooks, finds the matching item from the Airtable record, and generates a formal, detailed invoice. 5. Close the Loop: In the final step, the workflow updates the Airtable record one last time to: Add the QuickBooks Invoice #. Add the Stripe Payment Link. Change the Status to ""Invoiced."" Step-by-Step Setup Instructions This is an advanced workflow. Follow these setup steps carefully. 1. Connect Your Credentials Airtable: Create and connect a Personal Access Token with data.records:read and data.records:write scopes. QuickBooks: Connect your QuickBooks Online account using OAuth2 credentials. Stripe: Connect your Stripe account using your Secret Key. 2. Airtable Base Setup (Crucial) Your Airtable base must have a table with the following columns. The names must match exactly: Deal Name (Text) Client Name (Text) Client Email (Email) Status (Single-select with options: Draft, Approved for Invoicing, Invoiced) QuickBooks Customer ID (Text) Stripe Customer ID (Text) Stripe Payment Link (URL) QuickBooks Invoice # (Text) Stripe Price Id (Text - The API ID of your price in Stripe, e.g., price_123...) Quantity (Number) Quickbooks Product Name (Text) Created (Created Time) - This is used by the trigger. 3. Configure the n8n Nodes All Airtable Nodes: In each Airtable node, select your Base and Table from the dropdown lists. Get all Quickbook products (HTTP Request Node): You must replace {YOUR_QUICKBOOKS_COMPANY_ID} in the URL with your actual QuickBooks Company ID (also known as a Realm ID). 4. Activate the Workflow Save the workflow and toggle the Active switch to ""on"". The workflow will now trigger whenever the Created field is updated for a record in your Airtable base. Customization Guidance Changing the Trigger Status: If you use a different status than ""Approved for Invoicing,"" simply update the value in the ""IF - Status Check"" node. Modifying Invoice Details: You can customize the Description or other line item details in the ""Create an invoice"" (QuickBooks) node by pulling more fields from your Airtable record. Adding Email Notifications: To notify a customer when their invoice is ready, add a Gmail or SendGrid node after the last Airtable Update node. You can include the Stripe Payment Link and a PDF of the QuickBooks invoice directly in the email. Advanced Error Handling: For a production environment, consider connecting the false output of the various IF nodes or using the .onError() workflow setting to send a Slack or email alert if a customer can't be found or an API call fails.

9031,Automate Shopify Abandoned Cart WhatsApp Reminders with Product Links via Rapiwa,"Automate Shopify Abandoned Cart WhatsApp Reminders with Product Links via Rapiwa Who’s it for This n8n workflow automatically identifies customers who have abandoned their carts on your Shopify store, cleans and verifies their WhatsApp numbers, and sends them personalized reminders via the Rapiwa API. It also logs each interaction—whether the number was valid or not—into a connected Google Sheet. Designed for marketers, small business owners, freelancers, and support teams, this solution makes it easy to run bulk WhatsApp campaigns using just a Google Sheet and your own WhatsApp number—no need for the official WhatsApp Business API. It’s a budget-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-manage alternative for anyone looking to automate WhatsApp follow-ups without the tech hassle. How it Works / What It Does Reads rows from a Google Sheet where the Status column is marked as ""pending"". Cleans each phone number (removes special characters, spaces, etc.). Verifies whether the number is a WhatsApp user using the Rapiwa API. If valid: Sends the message via Rapiwa. Updates Status = sent and Verification = verified. If invalid: Skips sending. Updates Status = not sent and Verification = unverified. Waits a configurable delay between sends to avoid rate limits. Processes rows in small batches and repeats on schedule (default every 5 minutes). How to Set Up Duplicate the sample Google Sheet format and populate it with contacts and messages. Fill required columns such as WhatsApp No, Name, Message, Image URL, and set Status = pending. Connect Google Sheets in n8n and grant the required OAuth scopes. Create an HTTP Bearer credential in n8n and paste your Rapiwa API key. Configure the workflow nodes (Trigger, Google Sheets, Limit, SplitInBatches, Code, HTTP Request, If, Update Google Sheets, Wait). Enable the workflow in n8n. Requirements Google Sheets API credentials (OAuth2) configured in n8n Google Sheet matching the template (WhatsApp No, Name, Message, Status, Verification) Rapiwa account and Bearer token n8n instance with HTTP Request and Google Sheets nodes enabled How to Customize the Workflow Add or increase delay between messages using the Wait node (e.g., 5–10 seconds). Change message content or include media by editing the HTTP Request body. Personalize messages using sheet columns (Name, product details, coupon codes). Add error handling nodes to retry failed sends or log errors. Adjust the Limit node to control how many rows are processed per run. Workflow Highlights Triggered every 5 minutes using the Schedule Trigger node. Filters sheet rows where Status = pending. Cleans numbers and verifies WhatsApp existence before sending. Sends messages via Rapiwa (unofficial API). Updates Google Sheet rows with Status = sent/not sent and Verification = verified/unverified. Uses a Wait node to prevent rapid-fire sending. Setup in n8n 1. Connect Google Sheets Add a Google Sheets node. Authenticate with your Google account. Select the document and worksheet. Use a filter or query to fetch rows with Status = pending. 2. Loop Through Rows Use SplitInBatches to process rows in small chunks (e.g., 5 rows per batch). Add a Code node to clean phone numbers (remove non-digits). Add a Wait node to pause between individual sends (recommended 5 seconds). 3. Send Message via HTTP Node Configure an HTTP Request node to POST to: https://app.rapiwa.com/api/send-message Use Bearer Token authentication with your Rapiwa API key. Example JSON body: { ""number"": ""{{ $json['WhatsApp No'] }}"", ""message"": ""{{ $json['Message'] }}"" } After the send, update the row in Google Sheets with the result. Sample Google Sheet Structure A Google Sheet formatted like this ➤ sample | name | number | order id | item name | coupon | item link | total price | validity | status | | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | | Abdul Mannan | 8801400620056 | 39248398811454 | S25 Ultra 5XXXXX Price Cell Phone | | Product Link | 11500.00 BDT | unverified | not sent | | Abdul Mannan | 8801400620055 | 39248402153790 | S25 Ultra 5XXXXX Price Cell Phone | | Product Link | 11500.00 BDT | verified | sent | | Abdul Mannan | 8801400620055 | 39248403431742 | S25 Ultra 5XXXXX Price Cell Phone | | Product Link | 11500.00 BDT | verified | sent | Tips Ensure numbers are in proper format (e.g., 8801XXXXXXXXX — no +, no spaces). Use public image URLs if sending media. Store Rapiwa API key securely in n8n credentials. Test with a small batch before scaling up. Mark processed rows as ""sent"" to avoid duplicates. Increase Wait time or reduce batch size if you encounter rate limiting. Important Notes Avoid Duplicates: The Google Sheet serves as a ledger. Sent messages won’t be repeated in the next cycle. Rate Limit Awareness: Use Wait nodes to space out requests and avoid getting banned. Add Delay for Safety: If needed, increase wait times or limit message batches. Extendable: You can add product images, links, or even abandon cart discounts dynamically. Future Enhancements (Ideas) Add delay between batches (e.g., 60 messages/hour) Auto-update Shopify checkout status (via GraphQL API) Use more advanced templates or media (via Rapiwa) Add error handling to log failed API calls Use Telegram/Slack node to notify when process ends Useful Links Dashboard:** https://app.rapiwa.com Official Website:** https://rapiwa.com Documentation:** https://docs.rapiwa.com Support WhatsApp Support: Chat Now Discord: Join SpaGreen Community Facebook Group: SpaGreen Support Website: https://spagreen.net Developer Portfolio: Codecanyon SpaGreen",11,2025-09-28 05:00:04.423000+00:00,False,3

5744,Generate Research Questions from PDFs using InfraNodus Content Gap Analysis,"This template can be used to generate research questions from PDF documents (e.g. research papers, market reports) based on the content gaps found in text using the InfraNodus knowledge graph GraphRAG knowledge graph representation. Simply upload several PDF files (research papers, corporate or market reports, etc) and generate a research question / AI prompt in seconds. The template is useful for: generating research questions generating AI prompts that drive research further finding blind spots in any discourse and generating ideas that address them. avoiding the generic bias of LLM models and focusing on what's important in your particular context Using Content Gaps for Generating Research Questions Knowledge graphs represent any text as a network: the main concepts are the nodes, their co-occurrences are the connections between them. Based on this representation, we build a graph and apply network science metrics to rank the most important nodes (concepts) that serve as the crossroads of meaning and also the main topical clusters that they connect. Naturally, some of the clusters will be disconnected and will have gaps between them. These are the topics (groups of concepts) that exist in this context (the documents you uploaded) but that are not very well connected. Addressing those gaps can help you see which groups of concepts you could connect with your own ideas. This is exactly what InfraNodus does: builds the structure, finds the gaps, then uses the built-in AI to generate research questions that bridge those gaps. How it works 1) Step 1: First, you upload your PDF files using an online web form, which you can run from n8n or even make publicly available. 2) Steps 2-4: The documents are processed using the Code and PDF to Text nodes to extract plain text from them. 3) Step 5: This text is then sent to the InfraNodus GraphRAG node that creates a knowledge graph, identifies structural gaps in this graph, and then uses built-in AI to research questions / prompts. 4) Step 6: The ideas are then shown to the user in the same web form. Optionally, you can hook this template to your own workflow and send the question generated to an InfraNodus expert or your own AI model / agent for further processing. If you'd like to sync this workflow to PDF files in a Google Drive folder, you can copy our Google Drive PDF processing workflow for n8n. How to use You need an InfraNodus GraphRAG API account and key to use this workflow. Create an InfraNodus account Get the API key at https://infranodus.com/api-access and create a Bearer authorization key. Add this key into the InfraNodus GraphRAG HTTP node(s) you use in this workflow. You do not need any OpenAI keys for this to work. Optionally, you can change the settings in the Step 4 of this workflow and enforce it to always use the biggest gap it identifies. Requirements An InfraNodus account and API key Note: OpenAI key is not required. You will have direct access to the InfraNodus AI with the API key. Customizing this workflow You can use this same workflow with a Telegram bot or Slack (to be notified of the summaries and ideas). You can also hook up automated social media content creation workflows in the end of this template, so you can generate posts that are relevant (covering the important topics in your niche) but also novel (because they connect them in a new way).

9611,"AI-Powered NDA Review & Instant Alert System - Jotform, Gemini, Telegram","This workflow automates the process of analyzing a contract submitted via a web form. It extracts the text from an uploaded PDF, uses AI to identify potential red flags, and sends a summary report to a Telegram chat. Prerequisites Before you can use this workflow, you'll need a few things set up. 1. JotForm Form You need to create a form in JotForm with at least two specific fields: Email Address**: A standard field to collect the user's email. File Upload**: This field will be used to upload the contract or NDA. Make sure to configure it to allow .pdf files. 2. API Keys and IDs JotForm API Key**: You can generate this from your JotForm account settings under the ""API"" section. Gemini API Key**: You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio to use the Gemini model. Telegram Bot Token**: Create a new bot by talking to the @BotFather on Telegram. It will give you a unique token. Telegram Chat ID**: This is the ID of the user, group, or channel you want the bot to send messages to. You can get this by using a bot like @userinfobot. Node-by-Node Explanation Here is a breakdown of what each node in the workflow does, in the order they execute. 1. JotForm Trigger What it does**: This node kicks off the entire workflow. It actively listens for new submissions on the specific JotForm you select. How it works**: When someone fills out your form and hits ""Submit,"" JotForm sends the submission data (including the email and a link to the uploaded file) to this node. 2. Grab Attachment Details (HTTP Request) What it does**: The initial data from JotForm doesn't contain a direct download link for the file. This node takes the submissionID from the trigger and makes a request to the JotForm API to get the full details of that submission. How it works**: It constructs a URL using the submissionID and your JotForm API key to fetch the submission data, which includes the proper download URL for the uploaded contract. 3. Grab the Attached Contract (HTTP Request) What it does**: Now that it has the direct download link, this node fetches the actual PDF file. How it works**: It uses the file URL obtained from the previous node to download the contract. The node is set to expect a ""file"" as the response, so it saves the PDF data in binary format for the next step. 4. Extract Text from PDF File What it does**: This node takes the binary PDF data from the previous step and extracts all the readable text from it. How it works**: It processes the PDF and outputs plain text, stripping away any formatting or images. This raw text is now ready to be analyzed by the AI. 5. AI Agent (with Google Gemini Chat Model) What it does**: This is the core analysis engine of the workflow. It takes the extracted text from the PDF and uses a powerful prompt to analyze it. The ""Google Gemini Chat Model"" node is connected as its ""brain."" How it works**: It sends the contract text to the Gemini model. The prompt instructs Gemini to act as an expert contract analyst. It specifically asks the AI to identify major red flags and hidden/unfair clauses. It also tells the AI to format the output as a clean report using Telegram's MarkdownV2 style and to keep the response under 1500 characters. 6. Send a text message (Telegram) What it does**: This is the final step. It takes the formatted analysis report generated by the AI Agent and sends it to your specified Telegram chat. How it works**: It connects to your Telegram bot using your Bot Token and sends the AI's output ($json.output) to the Chat ID you've provided. Because the AI was instructed to format the text in MarkdownV2, the message will appear well-structured in Telegram with bolding and bullet points.",1,2025-10-14 10:06:35.784000+00:00,True,4

9945,Scrape Detailed GitHub Profiles to Google Sheets Using BrowserAct,"Scrape Detailed GitHub Profiles to Google Sheets Using BrowserAct This template is a sophisticated data enrichment and reporting tool that scrapes detailed GitHub user profiles and organizes the information into dedicated, structured reports within a Google Sheet. This workflow is essential for technical recruiters, talent acquisition teams, and business intelligence analysts who need to dive deep into a pre-qualified list of developers to understand their recent activity, repositories, and technical footprint. Self-Hosted Only This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for self-hosted n8n instances only. How it works The workflow is triggered manually but can be started by a Schedule Trigger or by integrating directly with a candidate sourcing workflow (like the ""Source Top GitHub Contributors"" template). A Google Sheets node reads a list of target GitHub user profile URLs from a master candidate sheet. The Loop Over Items node processes each user one by one. A Slack notification is sent at the beginning of the loop to announce that the scraping process has started for the user. A BrowserAct node visits the user's GitHub profile URL and scrapes all available data, including profile info, repositories, and social links. A custom Code node (labeled ""Code in JavaScript"") performs a critical task: it cleans, fixes, and consolidates the complex, raw scraped data into a single, clean JSON object. The workflow then dynamically manages your output. It creates a new sheet dedicated to the user (named after them) and clears it to ensure a fresh report every time. The consolidated data is separated into three paths: main profile data, links, and repositories. Three final Google Sheets nodes then append the structured data to the user's dedicated sheet, creating a clear, multi-section report (User Data, User Links, User Repositories).

This workflow is essential for dropshippers, e-commerce store owners, and anyone looking to quickly import product catalogs from specific websites into their Shopify store. Self-Hosted Only This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for self-hosted n8n instances only. How it works The workflow reads a list of product page URLs from a Google Sheet. Your sheet, with its columns for Product Name and Product Link, acts as a database for your workflow. The Loop Over Items node processes products one URL at a time. Two BrowserAct nodes run sequentially to scrape all product details, including the Name, price, description, sizes, and image links. A custom Code node transforms the raw scraped data (where fields like sizes might be a single string) into a structured JSON format with clean lists for sizes and images. The Shopify node creates the base product entry using the main details. The workflow then uses a series of nodes (Set Option and Add Option via HTTP Request) to dynamically add product options (e.g., ""Shoe Size"") to the new product. The workflow intelligently uses HTTP Request nodes to perform two crucial bulk tasks: Create a unique variant for each available size, including a custom SKU. Upload all associated product images from their external URLs to the product. A final Slack notification confirms the batch has been processed.

10089,Synchronizing WooCommerce Inventory and Creating Products with Google Gemini AI and BrowserAct,"Synchronize WooCommerce Inventory & Create Products with Gemini AI & BrowserAct This sophisticated n8n template automates WooCommerce inventory management by scraping supplier data, updating existing products, and intelligently creating new ones with AI-formatted descriptions. This workflow is essential for e-commerce operators, dropshippers, and inventory managers who need to ensure their product pricing and stock levels are synchronized with multiple third-party suppliers, minimizing overselling and maximizing profit. Self-Hosted Only This Workflow uses a community contribution and is designed and tested for self-hosted n8n instances only. How it works The workflow is typically run by a Schedule Trigger (though a Manual Trigger is also shown) to check stock automatically. It reads a list of suppliers and their inventory page URLs from a central Google Sheet. The workflow loops through each supplier: A BrowserAct node scrapes the current stock and price data from the supplier's inventory page. A Code node parses this bulk data into individual product items. It then loops through each individual product found. The workflow checks WooCommerce to see if the product already exists based on its name. If the product exists: It proceeds to update the existing product's price and stock quantity. If the product DOES NOT exist: An If node checks if the missing product's category matches a predefined type (optional filtering). If it passes the filter, a second BrowserAct workflow scrapes detailed product attributes from a dedicated product page (e.g., DigiKey). An AI Agent (Gemini) transforms these attributes into a specific, styled HTML table for the product description. Finally, the product is created in WooCommerce with all scraped details and the AI-generated description. Error Handling:* Multiple *Slack** nodes are configured to alert your team immediately if any scraping task fails or if the product update/creation process encounters an issue. Note: This workflow does not support image uploads for new products. To enable this functionality, you must modify both the n8n and BrowserAct workflows.

10813,Create SEO-Optimized Blog Articles with GPT-4o Mini's Multi-Stage Generation,"Overview This workflow converts a single topic into a full blog article through a structured multi-step process. Instead of generating everything in one pass, it breaks the task into clear stages to produce cleaner structure, better SEO consistency, and more predictable output quality. How this workflow differs from asking ChatGPT directly It does not produce an article in one step. It separates the process into two focused stages: outline generation and paragraph expansion. This approach gives you more control over tone, SEO, structure, and keyword placement. How it works 1. Generate outline The workflow sends your topic to an AI Agent. It returns a structured outline based on the topic, desired depth, language, and keyword focus. 2. Expand each subtopic The workflow loops through each outline item. Every subtopic is expanded into a detailed, SEO-friendly paragraph. Output is consistent and optimized for readability. 3. Produce final outputs Combines all expanded sections into: A clean JSON object A Markdown version ready for blogs or CMS The JSON includes: Title HTML content Markdown content You can send this directly to REST APIs such as WordPress, Notion, or documentation platforms. Content is validated for readability and typically scores well in tools like Yoast SEO. Uses GPT-4o Mini by default, with average token usage between 2000 and 3000 depending on outline size. Use cases Auto-generate long-form articles for blogs or content marketing. Turn Instagram or short-form scripts into complete SEO articles. Create documentation or educational content using consistent templates. Setup steps 1. Prepare credentials Add your OpenAI API Key inside n8n’s credential manager. 2. Adjust input parameters Topic or main idea Number of outline items Language Primary keyword Tone or writing style (optional) 3.

I understand. To complete the final template description for your Competitor Price Monitoring workflow, here is the dedicated How to Adapt the Template section, focusing on functional changes a user can make for advanced monitoring. ➕ How to Adapt the Template The workflow is currently configured for maximum efficiency and stability. To expand its functionality or change its dependencies, you can implement the following adaptations: Change Database for Storage:* Replace the *Google Sheets* nodes with *Airtable* or *Notion** nodes for historical storage. Since your comparison logic relies on the JSON string being saved and retrieved, you will only need to change the read/write operations (the Code logic remains the same). Change Alert Channel:* Easily swap the *Slack* node with a *Gmail, **Discord, or Pushover node to deliver critical price alerts to a different team or application. Dynamic Thresholds:* Modify the *Config: Alert Parameters* to include separate fields for price *increases (e.g., alert_increase_threshold) and price decreases (e.g., alert_decrease_threshold), allowing you to track competitor sales differently than price hikes. Advanced Price Filtering:* Adjust the code logic in *Code: Isolate Pricing Section** to target specific currency symbols (e.g., €, £) or to filter out prices that appear to be marked as promotional (e.g., text containing ""SALE"" or ""Discount""). Add Advanced Alert Reporting:* Instead of sending a simple Slack message, use the full list of price_diffs (which contains all plans) to generate a consolidated daily *CSV report* or a professional *HTML email** summarizing all movements, even those below the alert threshold.",1,2025-11-20 22:32:05.069000+00:00,True,6

11103,Aggregate Crypto and Stock Market News Feed from Multiple Sources,"This n8n template helps in making informed decisions for Crypto and Stocks Trading by helping you keep track of breaking changes in the market. How it works Collects crypto and/or stock market headlines from multiple sources: CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Google News, and X (via an RSS proxy). Normalizes all items into a consistent structure with fields like source, kind, title, url, publishedAt, matchedKeywords, media[], and topic. Uses topic-specific keyword lists to keep relevant items and a small spam blacklist to drop giveaways / airdrops / obvious noise. Deduplicates items across runs by tracking previously seen links. Bundles everything into a compact { topic, items[] } JSON payload and sends it to your own backend or UI via HTTP. Set up steps Import the template JSON into a new n8n workflow.

11121,Auto Create & Publish X-Threads (Twitter) with GPT via Telegram & Approval Loop,"AI X (twitter) Threads Bot with Approval Loop This n8n workflow transforms your Telegram messenger into a personal assistant for creating and publishing X-Threads. You can simply send an idea as a text or voice message, collaboratively edit the AI’s suggestion in a chat, and then publish the finished thread directly to X just by saying “Okay.” What You’ll Need to Get Started Before you can use this workflow, you’ll need a few prerequisites set up. This workflow connects three different services, so you will need API credentials for each: Telegram Bot API Key*: You can get this by talking to the “BotFather” on Telegram. It will guide you through creating your new bot and provide you with the API token. New Chat with Telegram BotFather OpenAI API Key*: This is required for the “Speech to Text” and “AI Agent” nodes. You’ll need an account with OpenAI to generate this key. OpenAI API Platform Blotato API Key: This service is used to publish the final post to X. You’ll need a Blotato account and to connect your X profile there to get the key. Blotato platform for social media publishing Once you have these keys, you can add them to the corresponding credentials in your n8n instance. How the Workflow Operates, Step-by-Step Here is a detailed breakdown of how the workflow processes your request and handles the publishing. 1. Input & Initial Processing This phase captures your idea and converts it into usable text. Node Name Role in Workflow Start: Telegram Message This Telegram Trigger node initiates the entire process upon receiving any message from you in the bot. Prepare Input Consolidates the message content, ensuring the AI receives only one clean text input. Check: ist it a Voice? Checks the incoming message for text. If text is empty, it proceeds to voice handling. Get Voice File If a voice note is detected, this node downloads the raw audio file from Telegram. Speech to Text This node uses the OpenAI Whisper API to convert the downloaded audio file into a text string. 2. AI Core & Iteration Loop This is the central dialogue system where the AI drafts the content and engages in the feedback loop. AI: Draft & Revise Post The main logic agent. It analyzes your request, applies the “System Prompt” rules, drafts the post, and handles revisions based on your feedback. OpenAI Chat Model Defines the large language model (LLM) used for generating and revising the post. Window Buffer Memory A memory buffer that stores the last turns of the conversation, allowing the AI to maintain context when you request changes (e.g., “Make it shorter”). Check if Approved This crucial node detects the specific JSON structure the AI outputs only when you provide an approval keyword (like “ok” or “approved”). Post Suggestion Or Ask For Approval Sends the AI’s post draft back to your Telegram chat for review and feedback. AI Agent System Prompt (Internal Instructions - English) The agent operates under a strict prompt that dictates its behavior and formatting (found within the AI: Draft & Revise Post node. 3. Publishing & Status Check Once approved, the workflow handles the publication and monitors the post’s status in real-time. Node Name Role in Workflow Approval: Extract Final Thread Posts Parses the incoming JSON, extracting only the clean text ready for publishing. Create post with Blotato Uses the Blotato API to upload the finalized content to your connected X account. Give Blotat 5s :) A brief pause to allow the publishing service to start processing the request. Check post status Checks back with Blotato to determine if the post is published, in progress, or failed. Published? Checks if the status is “published” to send the success message. In Progress? Checks if the post is still being processed. If so, it loops back to the next wait period. Give Blotat other 5s :) Pauses the workflow before re-checking the post status, preventing unnecessary API calls. Final Notification Node Name Role in Workflow Send a confirmation message Sends a confirmation message and the direct link to the published X post. Send an error message Sends a notification if the post failed to upload or encountered an error during processing. 🛠️ Personalizing Your Content Bot The true power of this n8n workflow lies in its flexibility. You can easily modify key components to match your unique brand voice and technical preferences. 1. Tweak the Content Creator Prompt The personality, tone, and formatting rules for your X content are all defined in the System Prompt. Where to find it: Inside the AI: Draft & Revise Post node, under the System Message setting. What to personalize: Adjust the tone, change the formatting rules (e.g., number of hashtags, required emojis), or insert specific details about your industry or target audience. 2. Switch the AI Model or Provider You can easily swap the language model used for generation. Where to find it: The OpenAI Chat Model node. What to personalize: Model: Swap out the default model for a more powerful or faster alternative (e.g., gpt-4 family, or models from other providers if you change the node). Provider: You can replace the entire Langchain block (including the AI Model and Window Buffer Memory nodes) with an equivalent block using a different provider’s Chat/LLM node (e.g., Anthropic, Cohere, or Google Gemini), provided you set up the corresponding credentials and context flow. 3. Modify Publishing Behavior (Schedule vs. Post) The final step is currently set to publish immediately, but you might prefer to schedule posts. Where to find it: The Create post with Blotato node. What to personalize: Consult the Blotato documentation for alternative operations. Instead of choosing the “Create Post” operation (which often posts immediately), you can typically select a “Schedule Post” or “Add to Queue” operation within the Blotato node. If scheduling, you will need to add a step (e.g., a Set node or another agent prompt) before publishing to calculate and pass a Scheduled Time parameter to the Blotato node.",1,2025-11-21 19:07:44.882000+00:00,True,6

Configure API Credentials Add the following credentials in n8n: Clearbit (Lead Enrichment) Create account at clearbit.com Generate API key from Settings → API Add as ""Clearbit API"" credential in n8n HubSpot (CRM Integration) Create private app in HubSpot Settings → Integrations → Private Apps Grant scopes: crm.objects.contacts.write, crm.objects.deals.write Copy app token Add as ""HubSpot App Token"" credential in n8n Calendly (Calendar Availability) Create OAuth app at calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks Configure OAuth2 credentials in n8n Set environment variable: CALENDLY_USER_URI with your user URI Get this from: https://api.calendly.com/users/me (returns your user URI) Slack (Team Notifications) Create Slack app at api.slack.com/apps Add Bot Token Scopes: channels:read, chat:write, channels:history Install app to workspace and copy Bot User OAuth Token Add as ""Slack API"" credential in n8n Update channel names in nodes: change ""hot-leads"" and ""leads"" to your actual channel names SendGrid (Email Fallback) Create account at sendgrid.com Generate API key from Settings → API Keys Verify sender email address Add as ""SendGrid API"" credential in n8n Update ""from"" email in ""Send Fallback Email"" node Google Sheets (Activity Logging) Create Google Cloud project and enable Sheets API Configure OAuth2 credentials in n8n Create a Google Sheet with columns matching the workflow Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID in ""Log to Google Sheets"" node with your actual sheet ID 2. Customize Fit Scoring Logic Edit the ""Calculate Fit Score"" node to match your ideal customer profile: Default Scoring: Company size 50-5,000 employees = 40 points Executive/Director seniority = 30 points Annual revenue ≥ $1M = 30 points Total possible:* 100 points | *High-intent threshold:** 60+ points To Customize: Adjust company size ranges based on your target market Change seniority requirements (C-level, VP, Manager, etc.) Modify revenue thresholds Update the 60-point threshold for high-intent routing 3. Set Up Webhook Endpoint Get Webhook URL: Activate the workflow Copy webhook URL from ""Lead Form Webhook"" node URL format: https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/demo-request Configure Form Provider: Point your website form POST request to the webhook URL Send JSON body with fields: email, name, company, phone, utm_source, utm_campaign, page_url, message Or map your existing form fields to these names in ""Normalize Lead Data"" node Example Form Integration: // HTML Form fetch('https://your-n8n.com/webhook/demo-request', { method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'lead@company.com', name: 'John Doe', company: 'Acme Inc', phone: '+1234567890', utm_source: 'google', page_url: window.location.href }) }) 4. Test the Workflow Initial Test: Activate the workflow Submit test lead via webhook (use Postman or curl) Verify Clearbit enrichment returns data Check HubSpot for created contact and deal Confirm Slack notification appears in correct channel Verify Google Sheet receives log entry Response Test: Wait 10 minutes after Slack notification Check if ""Check Slack Replies"" detects no response Verify fallback email sends via SendGrid Confirm lead receives booking email with Calendly link Calendly Test: Verify ""Get Calendly Event Types"" finds your Demo event Check ""Get Available Demo Slots"" returns actual time slots Confirm booking URLs work and pre-fill time selection 5. Monitor and Optimize Key Metrics to Track: Time from form submission to Slack notification (target: &lt;30 seconds) Sales response rate within 10 minutes Fallback email send rate (lower is better) High-intent lead conversion rate (booked → closed) Average fit score of closed deals Optimization Tips: Adjust fit score weights based on actual conversion data Tune the 60-point threshold for high-intent routing Customize Slack message format for your team's workflow Modify wait time (10 minutes) based on team availability Add custom fields to Google Sheet for additional tracking Requirements n8n Instance: n8n Cloud or self-hosted (v1.0+) Code node execution enabled Webhook functionality active External Services: Clearbit** - Enrichment API (paid service, free trial available) HubSpot** - CRM with API access (free tier available) Calendly** - Scheduling platform with API access (paid plans) Slack** - Workspace with bot integration capability SendGrid** - Email API (free tier: 100 emails/day) Google Sheets** - Google account with Sheets API enabled Technical Requirements: Public webhook endpoint (HTTPS) Environment variable support for sensitive data OAuth2 authentication capability Minimum 256MB RAM for code node execution Data Privacy: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for lead data storage Review data retention policies for all connected services Configure appropriate data handling in Google Sheets Add privacy policy link to email templates Tips and best practices Fit Scoring: Start with default scoring, then optimize based on actual conversion data Review monthly: which scores convert best? Adjust weights accordingly Consider adding industry filters for vertical-specific targeting Test different thresholds (50, 60, 70) to find optimal balance Lead Response: Keep 10-minute wait time during business hours Consider longer wait for after-hours leads (use schedule trigger) Customize Slack urgency based on fit score (🔥 for 80+, ⚡ for 60-79) Add @mentions in Slack for specific team members based on lead attributes Calendar Management: Use dedicated ""Demo"" event type in Calendly for consistent detection Ensure event name includes ""demo"" (case-insensitive) for workflow to find it Set appropriate buffer times between meetings in Calendly settings Review availability regularly to maintain high slot count Error Handling: All critical nodes have onError: continueRegularOutput to prevent workflow stops Monitor execution logs daily for failed enrichments or CRM errors Set up n8n error workflow to alert on consistent failures Keep fallback booking URL updated in case Calendly API fails Performance: Webhook responds immediately (within 2 seconds) even while processing continues Clearbit enrichment can take 3-5 seconds—this is expected Consider batching Google Sheets updates if processing &gt;100 leads/day Monitor n8n resource usage; Code nodes can be memory-intensive Privacy and Compliance: Add unsubscribe link to fallback emails Include data handling disclosure in form Set Google Sheet permissions appropriately (team only) Review Clearbit's data sources for compliance requirements Configure data retention in HubSpot to match your policy Customization Ideas: Add SMS notification for ultra-high fit scores (90+) Integrate with territory routing (route to specific sales rep by region) Add lead source scoring (paid &gt; organic &gt; referral) Create separate tracks for different product lines Build competitor mention detection in form messages Add qualification questions that influence fit score",1,2025-11-24 19:20:25.091000+00:00,False,7

980,Load data into spreadsheet or database,"This workflow is a generic example of how to load data from your workflow into a destination that stores tabular data. For example, a Google Sheets or Airtable sheet, a .CSV file, or any relational database like MySQL. Generally, you need to ensure that you send well-formatted data into the Spreadsheet or Database node. You can use the Set or Function node to transform data into the correct format for your destination. Key concepts Spreadsheets and databases have columns, like ""Name"" and ""Email"". The data you send into a Spreadsheet/ Database node needs to match these column names for each row of data that you want to insert. Data points need to be represented as key-value pairs. Specifically, each item of data needs to have a JSON key for each column in the sheet. For a spreadsheet with ""Name"" and ""Email"" columns, it would look like: {""Name"" : ""Karla"", ""Email"" : ""karla@email.com""} Before appending or inserting data to a spreadsheet or database, you might need to transform it into the correct format. You can preprocess the data with a Set or Function node. The Set node allows you to perform simple transforms when the data you want to load into spreadsheet rows is already represented as items. Use the Function node when you need to map nested data (like arrays) inside a single item to their own top-level items (Example in community forums).

1053,Git backup of workflows and credentials,"This creates a git backup of the workflows and credentials. It uses the n8n export command with git diff, so you can run as many times as you want, but only when there are changes they will create a commit. Setup You need some access to the server. Create a repository in some remote place to host your project, like Github, Gitlab, or your favorite private repo. Clone the repository in the server in a place that the n8n has access. In the example, it's the ., and the repository name is repo. Change it in the commands and in the workflow commands (you can set it as a variable in the wokflow). Checkout to another branch if you won't use the master one. cd . git clone repository Or you could git init and then add the remote (git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL), whatever pleases you more. As the server, check if everything is ok for beeing able to commit. Very likely you'll need to setup the user email and name. Try to create a commit, and push it to upstream, and everything you need (like config a user to comit) will appear in way. I strong suggest testing with exporting the commands to garantee it will work too. cd ./repo git commit -c ""Initial commmit"" --allow-empty -u is the same as --set-upstream git push -u origin master Testing to push to upstream with the first exported data npx n8n export:workflow --backup --output ./repo/workflows/ npx n8n export:credentials --backup --output repo/credentials/ cd ./repo git add . git commit -c ""manual backup: first export"" git push After that, if everything is ok, the workflow should work just fine. Adjustments Adjust the path in used in the workflow. See the the git -C PATH command is the same as cd PATH; git .... Also, adjust the cron to run as you need. As I said in the beginning, you can run it even for every minute, but it will create commits only when there are changes. Credentials encryption The default for exporting the credentials is to do them encrypted. You can add the flag --decrypted to the n8n export:credentials command if you need to save them in plain. But as general rule, it's better to save the encryption key, that you only need to do that once, and them export it safely encrypted.",0,,False,0

It uses getWorkflowStaticData('global') method to recover the next page (saved from the previous page), and it goes ahead with all the pages. There is a first section where the countries list is recovered and extracted. Later, I try to read if a local cache page is available and I recover the cached page from the disk. Finally, I save data to MongoDB, and we paginate all the pages in the country and for all the countries. I have applied a cache system to save a visited page to n8n local disk. If I relaunch workflow, we check if a cache file exists to discard non-required requests to the webpage. If the data present in the website changes, you can apply a Cron node to check the website once per week. Finally, before inserting data in MongoDB, the best way to avoid duplicates is to check that swift_code (the primary value of the collection) doesn't exist. I recommend using a proxy for all requests to avoid IP blocks. A good solution for proxy plus IP rotation is scrapoxy.io. This workflow is perfect for small data requirements. If you need to scrape dynamic data, you can use a Headless browser or any other service. If you want to scrape huge lists of URIs, I recommend using Scrapy + Scrapoxy.",0,,False,0
