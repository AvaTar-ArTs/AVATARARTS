## Revolutionary Technologies

### 1. Forensic Genetic Genealogy (FGG)

**What It Is**: The process of uploading crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases to find distant relatives, then building family trees to identify suspects.

**How It Works**:
1. Crime scene DNA is sequenced (typically 600K+ SNPs)
2. Profile uploaded to opt-in databases (GEDmatch PRO, FamilyTreeDNA)
3. System finds matches sharing 15+ cM (centiMorgans)
4. Genealogists build family trees from matches
5. Investigators narrow to suspects matching age/location
6. Traditional DNA testing confirms identity

**Breakthrough Moment**: 
- **Golden State Killer** (Joseph DeAngelo) - arrested April 2018 after 40+ years
- First major case to demonstrate FGG's power
- Led to explosion of cold case investigations

**Success Metrics**:
- 80%+ of samples result in 3rd cousin or closer matches

## Technical Methodologies

### 1. Kinship Coefficient Calculation

**Wright's Coefficient (θ)**:
```
θ = (k₁/2) + k₂
```
Where:
- k₁ = probability of sharing 1 allele Identity-by-Descent (IBD)
- k₂ = probability of sharing 2 alleles IBD

**Relationship Thresholds**:
| Relationship | Expected θ | Shared cM (mean) |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Parent-Child | 0.25 | 3,400 cM |
| Full Sibling | 0.25 | 2,550 cM |
| 1st Cousin | 0.0625 | 850 cM |
| 2nd Cousin | 0.0156 | 212 cM |
| 3rd Cousin | 0.0039 | 75 cM |
| 4th Cousin | 0.00098 | 30 cM |
| 5th Cousin | 0.00024 | 15 cM |
| Unrelated | <0.00024 | ~5 cM |

### 2. Identity-by-Descent (IBD) Detection

**Minimum Segment Length**: 7-12 cM (to minimize false positives)

**Detection Algorithms**:
- **GERMLINE**: Hash-based matching
- **RaPID**: Positional Burrows-Wheeler transform
- **IBIS**: Sparse representation
- **PLINK**: Standard tool for IBD detection

**Key Parameters**:
- Minimum segment length: 7 cM
- Minimum total shared: 15-20 cM
- Number of segments: 1+ (more segments = higher confidence)

### 3. Likelihood Ratio (LR) Calculations

**Formula**:
```
LR = P(Data | Related) / P(Data | Unrelated)
```

**Confidence Tiers**:
- **Tier 1** (LR > 10⁶): Direct lineage - 99.98% confidence
- **Tier 2** (LR 10⁴-10⁶): 2nd-3rd cousins - 95-97% confidence
- **Tier 3** (LR 10²-10⁴): Investigative leads - 85-94% confidence

**Court Admissibility**:
- Courts require probabilistic statements (LR) rather than absolute identifications
- Must report confidence intervals
- Document all statistical assumptions

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulations

**Purpose**: Quantify uncertainty in relationship predictions

**Process**:
1. Simulate 10,000-1,000,000 genealogies
2. Model DNA sharing distributions
3. Calculate probability distributions
4. Report 95% credible intervals

**Key Distributions**:
- **Related pairs**: Gamma distribution (captures natural variance)
- **Unrelated pairs**: Exponential distribution (models rare random matches)

### 5. Machine Learning Prioritization

**Features Used**:
- Shared cM
- Longest segment length
- Number of segments
- Kinship coefficient
- Likelihood ratio
- Geographic distance
- Age match
- Criminal history (if accessible)

**Models**:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Ensemble methods

**Output**: Prioritized suspect list with confidence scores

## Statistical & Probability Frameworks

### 1. Relationship Detection Accuracy

| Relationship | Expected θ | Detection Accuracy* |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1st Cousin   | 0.0625     | 99.1%               |
| 2nd Cousin   | 0.0156     | 95.3%               |
| 3rd Cousin   | 0.0039     | 82.7%               |
| 4th Cousin   | 0.00098    | 65.2%               |

_*Based on simulations with 500K SNPs_

### 2. Population Structure Adjustments

**FST Coefficient**: Measures population subdivision
- Typical values: 0.01-0.05
- Adjusts allele frequencies for population structure
- Reduces false positives from distant shared ancestry

**Balding-Nichols Model**:
```
Adjusted frequency = Beta(p * (1/FST - 1), (1-p) * (1/FST - 1))
```

### 3. Database Size Effects

**False Positive Rate**:
- Increases with database size
- Requires Bonferroni correction
- Typical adjustment: Multiply p-value by database size

**Example**:
- Database: 2.5 million profiles
- Unrelated match probability: 0.0001%
- Expected false positives: 2.5 per search

### 4. Degradation Modeling

**Factors**:
- Sample age
- Storage conditions
- DNA quantity
- Contamination risk

**Recovery Probability**:
- Pristine samples: >95% marker recovery
- Degraded samples: 50-80% marker recovery
- Highly degraded: <50% (may require specialized techniques)

**M-Vac Advantage**: Can recover DNA from samples previously considered exhausted
