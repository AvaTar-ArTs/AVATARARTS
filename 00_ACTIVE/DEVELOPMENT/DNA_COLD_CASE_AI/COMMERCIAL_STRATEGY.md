## 🔒 Code Protection Strategy

### 1. License Management

```python
class LicenseManager:
    """
    Hardware-bound license validation
    - Checks license server every 24 hours
    - Binds to hardware fingerprint
    - Prevents unauthorized copying
    """
```

### 2. Code Obfuscation

**Compile to Cython** (critical modules):
- `federated_search.py` → `.so` file (C extension)
- `blockchain_custody.py` → `.so` file
- `ml_prioritizer.py` → `.so` file
- Makes reverse engineering very difficult

### 3. Anti-Tampering

```python
class AntiTamper:
    """
    Verify code hasn't been modified
    - Hash all Python files
    - Compare to stored hashes
    - Detect tampering/reverse engineering
    """
```

### 4. Encrypted Configuration

- Encryption keys stored in secure vault (AWS KMS)
- Configuration encrypted at rest
- Environment-specific keys
