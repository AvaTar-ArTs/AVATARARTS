00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Notebook LM is the most slept on AI tool of the year, and it's not even close.

00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,300
While everyone's arguing about ChatGPT vs Claude, smart people are using this to build entire business systems in under an hour.

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,040
I'm talking full podcast episodes generated from your notes. Complete research reports from messy documents.

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,520
Entire client onboarding systems that run themselves. Here's what most people don't understand.

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,640
Notebook LM isn't just another chatbot, it's a complete automation engine that most people are using completely wrong.

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,520
They're asking it basic questions like it's ChatGPT.

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,560
That's like buying a Ferrari and driving it in first gear.

00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:41,480
What Notebook LM actually does is turn your messy knowledge into automated systems that work for you while you sleep.

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm going to show you exactly how we use this to automate client research, create training materials, and build content systems

00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,220
that pump out value every single day.

00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:58,260
We're talking about uploading our entire course library, letting Notebook LM study it, then creating custom onboarding sequences

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,380
for new members in literally 5 minutes.

00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,900
That used to take us hours, now it's automated.

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,120
And the craziest part, this tool is free.

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,100
Google built this thing, dropped it quietly, and most people completely missed it.

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,180
But the smart operators, they're already 10 steps ahead.

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:24,160
They're building podcast networks without recording, creating complete course curriculums from raw notes, turning client calls into training documentation automatically. So here's what we're covering today.

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,480
First, the complete setup from scratch, no assumptions.

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm showing you exactly how to get started, even if you've never touched this tool before.

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,740
Then we're going into the advanced features that nobody talks about.

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,940
The source management system, the citation tracking, the audio overview feature that literally creates podcast episodes from your documents.

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:53,160
Then we're hitting automation strategies, how to connect use cases.

00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm showing you exactly what we do at the AI Profit Boardroom, how we use this to grow our community, how we automate member

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,640
support, how we create new training content faster than anyone else in the space. This isn't theory.

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,060
This is what's actually working right now, and buckle up because this is going to move fast.

00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Every single second of this video is packed with value. Let's get into it.

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency.

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,740
Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates.

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below and let me know what you think.

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,940
Let's start with the first update, export notes and reports anywhere. So here's what changed.

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,740
You know how you'd create notes or study guides or briefing docs inside Notebook LM? Now you can export them.

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,660
Just go to your studio panel, find whatever you saved, click the three dots next to it, then choose export.

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,560
You can send it to Google Docs or Google Sheets. And here's the cool part.

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,320
If your content has tables in it, Notebook LM is smart enough to send it straight to Sheets.

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,400
So you get editable tables right away, no copying and pasting, no reformatting, just instant export. Why does this matter?

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Because Notebook LM is now a real workspace tool.

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
Before this update, everything lived inside Notebook LM.

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,800
You couldn't really share it or edit it with your team. Now you can.

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,220
You create a study guide in Notebook LM, export it to Docs and share it with your study group.

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,860
You make a briefing doc, export it to Sheets, and your whole team can edit it.

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,860
This makes Notebook LM way more powerful for collaboration.

00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,000
Students can use this, researchers can use this, teams can use this.

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,440
It's not just a viewer anymore, it's a real tool that fits into your workflow.

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,780
And honestly, this is what people have been asking for.

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,100
The ability to take what you build in Notebook LM and actually use it somewhere else.

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,780
Now you can export to Docs if you want to write more, export to Sheets if you want to track data. It's that simple.

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,380
And it works with everything you create in the studio panel, notes, study guides, reports, all of it.

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,960
One click and it's in your Google Drive ready to go.

00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760
But the export feature is just the warm-up.

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,140
The second update is the real game changer. Data tables. This is the insane part.

00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,620
Notebook LM can now turn your messy content into structured tables automatically.

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,340
Like you upload a meeting transcript or a research paper or a bunch of notes.

00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,220
Then you tell Notebook LM to make a data table and it analyzes everything and creates a clean organized table for you.

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,260
No manual work, the AI does it all. Here's how it works.

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,100
You go into Notebook LM, you select the sources you want to use, then you ask it to create a data table.

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,720
Notebook LM reads through everything, it finds the key info, it organizes it into rows and columns, and boom, you have a table.

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Then you can export that table straight into Google Sheets.

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,100
So now you have editable data you can analyze, sort, filter, whatever you need.

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:50,040
And honestly, if you want to stay ahead with tools like Notebook LM and automate more of your business with AI, you need to join the AI Profit Bordering Lab.

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,200
This is where I share the exact systems and automations we use to scale our agency.

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,880
You learn how to use tools like Notebook LM to organize your research, automate your workflows, and save hundreds of hours.

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,260
We've got members who are using AI to cut their workload in half.

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:12,780
If you want to scale your business, get more customers, and save time with AI automation, the AI Profit Boardroom is the place to be. Link is in the description.

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,280
Let me give you some use cases because this is where it gets really powerful. Imagine you have a meeting transcript.

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,620
Lots of ideas, lots of action items, but it's all scattered.

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,640
You throw it into Notebook LM, ask it to create a data table, and now you have a clean table with every action item, who's responsible, and the deadline done.

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Or let's say you're doing competitive research.

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
You have notes on five different competitors.

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,260
You ask Notebook LM to make a table comparing them side by side, features, pricing, target audience, all laid out.

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Or you're a student studying for exams.

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,880
You have lecture notes from 10 different classes.

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:54,320
You ask Notebook LM to create a study table with all the key concepts, definitions, and examples, instant study guide, or you're planning a project.

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,100
You have brainstorming notes, timelines, team assignments, all mixed together.

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,680
You ask Notebook LM to turn it into a project planning chart.

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,500
Everything organized by task, person, and deadline.

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,140
You see where I'm going with this.

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,140
Data tables save you hours of manual work.

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:17,800
Instead of reading through everything and typing it into a spreadsheet yourself, Notebook LM does it for you. And it's fast. We're talking minutes, not hours. Now here's the thing.

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
Data tables are live right now for pro and ultra users.

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,320
If you're on the free plan, it's coming soon.

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Google said they're rolling it out to everyone.

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,500
So if you don't see it yet, just wait a bit.

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,560
But if you have pro or ultra, go try it right now.

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,560
Upload some content, ask for a data table, see what it creates.

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,660
I think you're going to be blown away by how good it is.

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,240
And look, this is a massive productivity boost.

00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,840
You're not spending hours organizing data anymore.

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,420
You're not copying and pasting into spreadsheets. You're not reformatting tables. Notebook LM handles all of that.

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,840
You just tell it what you need and it builds it.

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,200
This is perfect for students who need to organize study material.

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,320
This is perfect for teams who need to track tasks and projects.

00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,120
This is perfect for researchers who need to compare data.

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,760
This is perfect for anyone who works with information.

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,040
All right, so those are the two big export anywhere and AI generated tables.

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
But here's what you need to know.

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,940
These updates are part of a bigger trend.

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,860
Google is turning Notebook LM into a serious tool.

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,260
It's not just a simple note taker anymore. They've been adding features like crazy.

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,180
They added an enhanced studio panel where you can create multiple outputs.

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,960
They added chat history that saves across sessions.

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,240
They're even hinting at deeper integration with Gemini. So Notebook LM is evolving fast.

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,560
Now, let me give you some tips for actually using these new features. First, the export feature. Use it to collaborate.

00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,980
Don't keep everything locked inside Notebook LM.

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,220
Export your notes to docs and share them with your team.

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,140
Export your tables to sheets and let people add to them.

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,760
This makes Notebook LM a team tool, not just a solo tool. Second, the data tables feature.

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,880
Think about what you want before you ask Notebook LM to create a table.

00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,500
If you want a comparison table, make sure your sources have comparison data.

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,040
If you want an action item table, make sure your sources mention tasks and deadlines.

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
The better your input, the better your output.

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,200
Third, experiment with different types of content.

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,040
Try uploading meeting notes and creating task tables.

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,580
Try uploading research papers and creating fact tables.

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Try uploading study material and creating revision tables.

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,100
See what works best for your workflow.

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,600
And fourth, remember you can export everything.

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,000
Once you create a table in Notebook LM, export it to sheets.

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,420
Then you can filter it, sort it, add formulas, whatever you need.

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,040
The table in Notebook LM is just a starting point.

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,300
The real power comes when you export it and work with it in sheets.

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,860
We're going to see even more powerful features, deeper research capabilities, be better video overview tools, full integration

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,360
with Gemini so you can export to Gemini and keep working there.

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,760
Google is clearly investing in Notebook LM.

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,460
They're adding features fast and they're listening to what users want.

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,520
So if you're not using Notebook LM yet, now is the time to start.

00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,020
These new updates make it way more useful.

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,220
So go try it, see what you can build, and let me know in the comments what tables you create.

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,080
I want to hear how you're using this.

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,300
And honestly, if you want to stay ahead with tools like Notebook LM and automate more of your business with AI, you need to join the AI Profit Boardroom.

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
Notebook LM has some huge updates recently.

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,500
These are the new free updates from Notebook LM that we're going to run through today.

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,980
You get access to notebooklm.google and I'm going to run you through some of the latest updates.

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,680
So you can now, for example, turn one single document into six different things.

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,640
Video, slide decks, infographic, research reports, flashcards, quizzes, etc.

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,400
And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works. We're testing it live right now.

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm going to upload one PDF to show you how fast it spits out a video, pitch deck, infographic, and more.

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,820
And this is the kind of stuff that used to take a full team. Designers, editors, researchers.

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,400
Now you can do it all with one click.

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,660
So if we get straight into this, you can see an example of Notebook LM here.

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,980
If you want to get started, you can just start running an example over here, load your sources, you can do deep research.

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,820
So for example, let's say you've got an interesting example, right?

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,420
So for me, I want to learn more ways to grow my school community, right? Now how can I do that?

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,560
What I can actually do is here is I can click on deep research and then I can type in what I want to learn about, right?

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,280
So for example, like getting more customers on the school.

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,680
And from here, we can start doing deep research automatically with Notebook LM and you'll actually search many different sources

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,300
on the web, across the web to start building with this. All right.

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,280
If you have any questions as we go along, feel free to ask. Crystal says, love Notebook LM. Absolutely, I do too.

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,160
Crystal said, think tuning fell asleep, man works too hard.

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,260
And you can see an example here of how we're loading in that deep research.

00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,200
I've actually plugged in a bunch of examples here.

00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,780
And if you want to generate, for example, like a podcast or a video, if you wanted to generate flashcards, quizzes, infographics,

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,860
slide decks, data tables, or mind maps, we can do that all right here on the right hand side, right?

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,380
So it's automatically loading it, which is super powerful and it's free and it's easy to use. It doesn't take long at all.

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,700
And you can start doing this without much effort at all. All right.

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,020
Now I want to show you a bunch of practical examples in a minute.

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,300
You can see how easy this is to get done. So let's keep going through now.

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,980
Whilst waiting for these to load, I'm going to actually load up a new notebook in the background.

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,440
As you can see, we're going to run through some examples to test. All right.

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,760
So the first one, I'm actually going to create a new notebook here and I'm going to upload some details about the AI Profit Boarding. So we'll copy the text.

00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
We'll go to the AI Profit Boarding.

00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm actually just going to load the sales page.

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,080
And I'm going to plug that into the chat sources. Here we go. All right.

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
We'll insert that information into the sources over here.

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,220
And now let's create a notebook with the information from the AI Profit Boarding.

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,540
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to video overview to generate kind of like a course trailer with AI narration explaining what members will learn.

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,260
But the difference here is I'm going to switch this to explainer.

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,920
We're actually going to change that to, we can change the visual style to like the classic.

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:32,520
And then I'm just going to say here create a short trailer teasing my course, plus selling the benefits of it.

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,260
Or create a short trailer teasing my community. Then we can hit generate.

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
And that will actually generate a video view.

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,240
It's basically like a video sales letter for our community. Right.

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,180
And you see how easy and quick this is to do. All right. Data tables as well. Data tables is another option.

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:55,100
And I pulled out, let's see, so Lalith says I pulled out a Harvard level research from Knight Sources. I can immediately publish. And wow, that's pretty All right. Dr.

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,520
David says Notebook LM is really the best AI tool out there, especially since it became integrated into Gemini. Yeah, I would agree.

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
And then says shout out from India Julian.

00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,240
I've been following you since a little more than a month and love all your videos. Appreciate that man. Greetings to you too. All right.

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,520
So you see here how it's beginning to generate the video overview using the information that we've plugged in, which is just a sales page for my community. Right.

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,260
So that's one example of how you can use this.

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,120
You can use it to generate like really quick video sales letters, et cetera.

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,160
What we can also do, this is interesting too, is we can actually upload like a competitor's sales page and get a video breakdown of their offer structure.

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,920
Let me show you exactly how that works. Right.

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,660
So if we go on create new over here, we're going to go to copy text.

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,300
And obviously I'm not going to take my competitor's page on a live stream, but I will take my own and we can use it as an example. Right.

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,920
So I can take that and then we can go to import, paste the text in there.

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,780
Or what you can do is you can just actually add it as a source, as a website source.

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,760
You could actually take the website here, paste in the URL like that, hit insert.

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,720
Oh yeah, it can import, go high level pages, which is pretty good. All right.

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,140
And now we can say, okay, reverse engineer my competitor's offer.

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,580
And we'll put that in the chat.

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,780
But before I actually do that, what we're going to do over here is go to the settings. I'm going to go to custom.

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,040
Yeah, we'll go to settings and then custom here.

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,820
You can actually explain the role, right?

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:19,360
So you could say, okay, you are a competitor analyst analyzing and breaking down my competitor's marketing strategies. All right. We'll disable now.

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,160
And then we're going to click on reverse engineer my competitor's offer.

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,100
And basically you can use this as kind of like a competitor analysis.

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,120
They can quickly analyze your competitors, find different resources, find different use cases, and then go from there.

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:38,500
Mim says, love your videos on X and Facebook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. And Alkeem says, greatness. That's awesome. Thank you.

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,520
So you see here, for example, based on the intelligence gathered from Cordy's agency's landing page materials, I've reverse

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,940
engineered their marketing strategy and offer structure. It's compared to analysis view.

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,380
This is a highly productized SEO model that relies heavily on AI automation, blah, blah, blah. Right.

00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:01,260
And this explains what it does, the hook and risk reversal, pricing psychology, the fulfillment mechanism, the competitive vulnerabilities. Right. And everything else.

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,840
And so it actually talks about ways that you can make the offer better.

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:14,140
And then you can say, okay, now create a sales page with a better offer than my competitors, right. It direct response style.

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,140
And what I actually do is reverse engineer my competitors, break down their offer.

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,140
And then from there, I actually create like a better sales page that we could use to create something more interesting. And that's constructing the offer.

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
And we're good to go in here.

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
And you can see it's now create a headline.

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,560
The offer is actually used the offer from our competitors, as you can see here, but it's made it slightly more compelling.

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,160
And then you can see the whole sales page broken down, right.

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,660
It's so easy to start doing that.

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,620
And so just to recap here, what have we done?

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,400
We've automated deep research and pulled in a bunch of sources to fix any business problems that we have.

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,800
We've also loaded in a competitor page into a notebook and then reverse engineer their offer.

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,120
Also create a better sales page than the original one with a better offer based on reverse engineering our competitors page, right. Super simple and easy.

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,240
You can do all of this for free.

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:03,740
On top of that, what we've also done is we actually created flashcards, quizzes, an infographic, a podcast, etc. on all the

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,480
stuff that we loaded into it, right.

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,620
So you can actually create six or eight different automations for free directly inside notebook LM, as you can see.

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:18,780
So if you click on this infographic here, you see that we've generated an infographic automatically based on the information we loaded into notebook, right. Super powerful, really easy to do.

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,540
And it doesn't take long at all, right.

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,960
We've literally done that in less than 10 minutes. It's ridiculously easy. All right.

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,780
Let me talk about the old way versus new way, right.

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,860
So for creating videos, the old way was like hire a video editor, wait days, it'd be expensive to hire them and you go back and forth with revisions.

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:40,040
The new way is you upload your document, click a button and get video of AI narration in minutes for free using notebook LM, as you can see today.

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,340
It's generating that video and the slide deck over there.

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,840
With slide decks, the old way was open PowerPoint, spend hours formatting for images, try to make it look good, give up and use ugly slides anyway, right.

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,180
The new way is upload your PDF notes, notebook LM builds a deck for you, graphs, diagrams and visuals included.

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:02,140
The old way of infographics, you would like hire a designer on Fiverr, wait three to five days. It could be expensive. Hope they understand what you want.

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,860
The new way is like you can upload any content for free into notebook, get a vertical horizontal infographic instantly.

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,420
And it's perfect for posting on LinkedIn or Instagram or TikTok, right.

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,720
You see an example of that infographic over here. Let's pull it up. There you go. Deep research.

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:25,240
The old way was like you have 47 browser tabs open, you spend all day reading, you try to notebook LM to research topic, get

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,220
a full report with over 30 sources synthesized, and then turn that report into slides for a video of one more click.

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,860
The old way of training your team was like you would write long SOPs, hope your team reads them, they don't, repeat yourself forever. I've been there.

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:44,120
The new way is you upload recipes, generate flashcards and quizzes, and now your team actually learns and you can test them, right. And repurposing content.

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,560
The old way was like one piece of content equals one use.

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,240
You write a blog, that's all you get. Everything else takes more work.

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,060
New way is you get one piece of content, six outputs, video slides, infographics, podcasts, flashcards, quizzes, and it's all from one single upload.

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,340
So you see how game-changing all this stuff is and how easy it is to implement as well.

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
Let's go back to over here and we'll start building with this.

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,380
And the next example I'm going to show you is you can actually upload like 10 of your best performing YouTube videos and generate

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:18,200
a video or a slide deck or some information explaining what makes Julian's content work and just get a breakdown of what really works for the business, right.

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,900
What the best performing piece of content is.

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
So let me show you an example of this.

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,700
We're actually going to go into Notebook LM.

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,100
So I'll grab my top performing YouTube videos and we're going to sort by popular, right.

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,620
So which videos are the most popular and why, what were the best hooks, what was the best content, etc.

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,180
And it's always best to learn from what worked before.

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,360
So I'm going to grab that video, we'll plug it in and we'll grab the next one, all right.

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,100
And I'm doing this live so I can show you how quick and easy it is to do.

00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,140
It literally only takes two minutes to build this but basically you can get like a greatest hits machine that automates the

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,640
best hooks and the best content for your business by figuring out what worked for you previously.

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm just going to do the top five actually I think, just save a bit of time.

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,560
All right so we've loaded the top five sources but I would recommend doing like top 10 minimum just so you can have enough data, right.

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:10,340
Now what we're going to do is we're going to go to Settings over here, Custom and we say okay you're a content analyzer trained on Julian Goldie's best performing content. See the videos loaded.

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,380
Give Julian advice on what to do based on his best performing content, e.g. hooks, etc.

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,180
And we'll say respond as Alex or Moe.

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:26,920
Hit save and then we're going to go inside here and we'll say okay give me five hooks for the topic and we'll just save the topic from today.

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,340
So for example this topic, let's grab that topic up here.

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,020
We'll go into another glen and we'll say give me five hooks for a topic based on what worked before.

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,820
All right and so we're basically analyzing our content which is on the left hand side.

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,300
You can easily do that on YouTube by just going to popular.

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,320
If you're on LinkedIn or whatever you can do the same. This is beginning to play out.

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,220
Here's an example and you can use this to build stuff out, right. Same with this, right.

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,460
You can see how easy it is to build this stuff out, how quick and easy it is to use.

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,960
So for example one could be the ultimate course value stack and it could be like today you're getting my ultimate course on notebook LM updates.

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm going to show you how to host it, how to automate your research, how to turn one document into a full-blown podcast.

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,020
This complete masterclass 100% free and we are starting now, right.

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,180
That'll be a great hook for a video.

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,140
How do we come up with it?

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,040
We looked at our best performing content and then we generated it from that, right.

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,280
So it's really easy to create this stuff, really easy to automate it and this is smart stuff that most people would struggle to create themselves.

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,520
Now what we could also do is we could go into the AI Profit Boredom community.

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,020
So let's do that and if we go to the community here, by the way feel free to join if you haven't already.

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,560
This is one of the best AI automation community on the planet my friends, not biased at all.

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,260
But we're going to take all the questions as you can see right here.

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,280
We can go into notebook LM, create a new notebook.

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,160
We'll paste in the text first and then we're going to change the title to FAQs for the AI Profit Boredom.

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,920
Alright and then from here what we're going to do is we are going to say over here slide deck based on the sources loaded

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:02,020
which are my customers top FAQs, create an onboarding document and that's going to generate a slide deck based on the most

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,740
common FAQs inside the AI Profit Boredom community and then now we've got an onboarding presentation and when we bring new

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,540
customers into the community we can onboard them quickly, we can show them the presentation and they get all the information

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,280
and the questions and the answers that you need.

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,040
So these are like real business use cases and interesting ones that the people have never really seen before.

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,100
Another thing that you could do is you can actually upload your analytics and then use that to generate infographics.

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll show you what I mean in a second.

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,840
So let's say for example I've got my content here right and I'm going to go to lifetime.

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,860
So we analyze all my views and content by lifetime.

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,320
Now what we're going to do in a second is actually export that into a csv or a google sheet.

00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Alright so let's export it into a google sheet.

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,200
I'm going to take top content from my channel and we're going to use that in a second to generate an infographic inside notebook charting digit.

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,480
So that's loaded all the data here as you can see.

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,380
I'm going to put youtube stats 2025.

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,080
Alright then I'm going to go to google drive here, take that document and load that as a source inside notebook lm.

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,160
Now using notebook lm and if that fails it's okay, it might be too big.

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,620
Let me try and load it as a csv.

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,740
Can't load it as a csv, okay no problem.

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,540
Let's copy the text and we'll just copy a little bit of it just to make it easy and we'll load that pasted text into the document

00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,380
as you can see and then we'll create an infographic and basically you can automate an infographic based on your best content

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,320
and then get information on okay what's working, what's not, how to improve etc.

00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Which content performed the best and that sort of thing which is pretty cool.

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,820
The other thing you can do here is you can actually train your team right.

00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,940
So for example here we can take this like and we can go into deep research like that.

00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,060
Let me say buy me the best link building strategies 2025 right.

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,640
We can actually generate some deep research on the best link building strategies 2025, generate a massive report and then

00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,340
create flashcards to train the team members at my SEO agency.

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,920
So we can quickly generate these reports that we find extremely useful for training our team internally.

00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:03,540
So for example I've loaded my best like sales recipes and playbooks into notebook and then use that as a chatbot to train my team right. Really powerful and easy.

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,680
So you can generate like quizzes to test new hires.

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,160
You could upload client briefs and create flashcards for your team to memorize client details before course.

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,140
You could upload your course content and then generate certification quizzes for AI Profit Boarding members right.

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,700
All sorts of cool stuff here and then if you want to see examples of what we've built previously let me find some examples here.

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,660
For example like this one you can see on the right hand side we've actually for example got an infographic.

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,840
We have videos of slides etc podcasts even content in Chinese.

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,620
You can actually create content in foreign languages too.

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,480
Then you see some examples of like featured notebooks here as well.

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,140
So these are actually like featured notebooks as you can see drawn on the latest scientific research and work of classic philosophers

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,480
to lead a more fulfilling life right.

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:51,880
And then it's actually got like ancient wisdom all these different podcasts on the right hand side that have been for this.

00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,720
It's amazing for learning, for growing, for improving, for fixing business problems, for creating automations, content etc.

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,000
You could do this all inside Notebook LM. Pretty powerful.

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,640
And some people say AI content looks fake and looks cheap etc and that was true like two years ago but not anymore.

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,340
The videos Notebook LM creates look really professional. The slides look clean.

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,760
The infographics look like something a design agency made. Is it perfect?

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,800
No but nothing is perfect and it's 90% of the way there.

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,320
And that last 10% you could always tweak yourself in minutes.

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,760
So don't let the fear of AI content looks bad stop you from making any content at all.

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,820
A lot of people as well will say my business is different and that sort of thing. And every business owner says this. My business is different.

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,380
This won't work for me blah blah blah. Let me ask you something.

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,300
Do you have documents, pdfs, blog posts, saps, client briefs, any kind of written content at all? If yes, Notebook works for you.

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,060
We use it for our SEO agency all the time.

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,600
I use it for their profit border. I use it for YouTube content.

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,060
Members in our community use it for consulting, ecom, real estate agency etc. Your business is not different.

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,400
Your business has content and this tool turns that content into more content. So it's pretty simple and easy.

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,940
And if you have any questions as we go along, feel free to ask. It says hello.

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,160
Alright so you see how to use Notebook LM, how powerful it is.

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,040
Let me talk about an easy way to quickly generate this using the Goldie 6-in-1 content multiplier framework.

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,880
So this is my personal system for turning one piece of content into six different assets using Notebook LM.

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,460
What you'll be able to do after you learn this framework is you'll be able to take any single document and create for example video of you.

00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,680
So a short video of AI narration explaining your content.

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,920
Slide decks aka a professional presentation with graphs and visuals.

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,600
Infographics, a visual summary perfect for social media.

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,940
Deep research reports, a cooperative analysis with over 30 sources.

00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,160
Flashcards which are quick reference cards for training on studies.

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,060
And quizzes, an interactive test to check understanding all from one upload in under 10 minutes.

00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,380
Now it says what's the digital avatar?

00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,620
You only make this sound in the video with your voice or it's all everything AI automatic.

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,860
So the digital avatar for example like the videos on my YouTube channel like this one.

00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,800
These are videos which automatically create with AI.

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,480
Right so I don't create them, my team creates them, we have editors, you can train the whole process. But yeah basically it's all trained.

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,780
The AI is trained on my voice, the video is created automatically and then you can also generate content with AI.

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,120
If you want to learn more about that we have trainings inside all you're going to do is just go to classroom over here and

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,960
then inside the AI Profit Boarding you're going to go to the playbook and inside the playbook you have all of these different

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,960
strategies on how to use AI avatars like this one right here.

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,820
Right it's a full training program with step-by-step tutorial on exactly how to generate these AI avatar videos.

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,620
So let's get back to this now.

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,880
So let me show you a 30-day implementation roadmap so you can start mastering this. Day one seven foundation week.

00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,440
What you're going to do is get set up and make your first right so you could for example gather your best content this could

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,740
be your best your most popular blogs, pdfs, notes from your best presentations, company fbs, client case studies etc and you

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,140
can just upload one piece of content to notebooklm but don't overthink it just pick something generate your first audio overview

00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,100
the podcast feature listen to it and just get a feel for how notebooklm works right.

00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,040
So you can generate podcasts like you see on the right hand side how do you do that you just create a new notebook like this

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,200
and then you're going to click on audio overview and that's how you generate podcasts inside notebook.

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,640
You can click on video view up and then you can use that to generate a podcast as well.

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,080
The other thing to note here is that notebooklm now save chat history so inside your notebook you can see all the things you've

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,740
asked the notebook as you see inside the chat section here so you can always reflect and go back on this stuff too if you want.

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:25,420
Alright day 8 to 14 this is like expansion time test all the different outputs try the slide deck feature upload the case

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,640
study report see what kind of presentation it builds etc try the infographic features and then day 15 to 21 system week right

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,040
so you're going to build your personal console flow and that sort of thing.

00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,260
The other cool thing is when you're building out these systems for example I've loaded my sales playbook inside here I could

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,980
actually ask the trainer okay what could I improve on this SAP to make it better plus easier to follow right and then we can

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:53,040
basically create like a better system based on notebooklm looking at our existing systems to see okay how can we improve this

00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,700
what do we need to change here so it's actually prioritizing the best steps looking at what the best thing to do is here and

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,460
it's actually giving us like a clean script document for example idea or group the golden rules stop repeating yourself right

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,880
organized by phase for example like the setup the mindset the process the grind etc and all these other different things so

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,580
it's pretty cool. and then in the 30-day roadmap for using notebooklm and mastering it you know ramp up production and get

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,620
faster right so you're going to run the system each week you create one anchor piece of content you can multiply it in six

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,860
and track results see which outputs get the most engagement which ones to try the most leads double down on what works and

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,100
also share your wins inside the airprofit board post your outputs get feedback see what other members are creating and by

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,280
day 30 you should have a repeatable content system it takes a fraction of what you used to spend so you can post your progress

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,560
inside the airprofit board here just go to the win section and then you can share your wins just like everyone else is inside

00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,960
the airprofit board like Scott, Michelle, Vladimir etc.

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,440
Vladimir created his own MCP server which is pretty cool telegram hosting robots being created all this cool stuff that other

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,120
members inside the airprofit board are building and then here's a bunch of live build ideas by the way if you want the video

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,320
notes from today you can get it inside the AI success lab link in the comments description you can see here we have 40,000

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,980
members who are serious about using AI automation so if you want to connect with them you can join the airprofit board room

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,260
inside the classroom here if you go to december 2025 you can see the free video notes from today along with the custom build

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:18,140
ideas and everything that i'm showing you right. so let's talk about homework. what would i recommend after this? after this

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,640
video here's what i want you to do. go to notebooklm, it's free you get it right there. upload one document you already have

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,220
right that could be a blog post, a pdf, a case study, anything. generate at least two different outputs. so for example try

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,060
the video feature, try the slide depth feature, see what happens. then post your results inside the airprofit board and community.

00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,000
show us what you made, get feedback, celebrate your wins, connect with me right and do that all inside the airprofit board

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,040
right here and don't just take my word for it like that this stuff actually works. we actually have over 100 pages of testimonials

00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:52,040
from real members getting real results with real automation right. so for example if we check out the testimonials document

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,180
of the airprofit board you can see all of these people just getting awesome results with ai right if you want to learn about

00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,630
this if you want to grow with this check out the airpo- board because you can see all these people just winning and learning

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,530
and growing with it. it's literally a endless scroll at this point. all right, so just showed you something powerful. okay

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,250
notebook lem is free. you need to have one document, six different pieces of content. but here's the thing: the tool is just

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:18,150
a tool. what matters is the system around it. and that's exactly what i'm going to show you inside the air right now. we have

00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:25,470
a offerum for the airprofit board. so if you sign up now, you get access to coaching support. you get access to the community,

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:32,710
the classroom, the calendar. and we actually have a few spots left on our latest offer, right? which is, if we scroll down

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:39,290
here inside the community, we are offering a few things. simple number one: you'll get the exact system for growing a school

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,550
community. so if you want to build your own school community for your business, which i know a lot of people are interested

00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:49,530
in right now, we actually have training inside the airprofit board showing you exactly how to do that. on top of that, you'll

00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,490
get the ai avatar clone system. so you'll learn how to clone yourself with ai make video content without being on camera.

00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:02,030
one member inside the airprofit board actually built a faceless channel that is getting like thousands of subscribers right

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:09,710
now. we also have a twitter ai automation method. so we'll show you how i automate my x account to reach how many people do

00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:18,330
reach per day, like 170,000 people a day on x right? so if you want to learn how i automated x with ai join the airprofit

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,270
board. on top of that, you get the empire builder focus manual. right? so when you actually sign up, you'll see the start

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,830
here section inside the airport, as you can see. and inside here, we actually have something called the focus protocol Julian

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:35,750
Goldie ultimate focus manual. right? and inside that manual, we'll basically show you my personal productivity system so that

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,930
you can avoid overwhelm and get more done in less time. you'll also learn how to rank the board with free access to the seo

00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,130
circle and all sorts of stuff. so if you want to get that link in the comments description to the airprofit board, and you

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,770
can get that directly inside there. when jan says, where can we access the document?" and if you go into this live stream

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:59,010
on youtube and then you go to the description here, you can get access right here. all right, so click on that link. you can

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:06,830
get access to the success, lab, and then. inside the classroom, you go to december 2025, and you'll find all the info right

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,190
here on the video note. completely free. for example, here you can create a new notebook. and one of the most recent updates

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,830
you can use is deep research. right now, this is super powerful because if you need to go in depth on something about notebook

00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:23,470
glen then you can go inside here and just type in whatever you want and then get access to it directly. so let me show you

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:31,190
what i mean. let's say, for example, i want to learn 10, right? i can actually type in na10 automation over here inside, and

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:37,150
then we're going to enter like so. and that will actually plan out all the deep research for our notebook. and then once we've

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,430
done that, we can generate all of these. now the great thing about deep research inside notebook glen is that you can load

00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,930
like multiple sources, and you don't have to do any research yourself. and it will just go super in depth across our web.

00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,850
now if you want to see some examples what i've built previously using notebook glen let me show you some examples right here.

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:59,450
so you see here, for example, we've got notebook lms for google flows updates, google disco. we've got a rseo content right

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,710
here, a community retention engagement tool, the advanced sales operating procedure. this is actually a tool that i built

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,930
to train my team, my sales team, on like exactly how to use my playbook for getting clients, right? and convert them on the

00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:17,430
course. now what you can also do, and this is a new update from gemini this is not a free version, but i'm sure it will come

00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:23,570
out for free. you can actually go inside gemini and load up a notebook and go super deep in with it, right? so for example,

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:29,230
if we load this up, we're gonna, for example, pull up the advanced sales operating procedure here. then we can go to tools,

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:37,170
canvas, and we can say, okay turn this into a beautifully designed web page or landing page," right? basically what that would

00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:48,950
do is connect notebook glen to gemini and then we can start using that notebook to build out a new tool. or a you can actually

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:54,350
select multiple notebooks on the list like this, and it will reference some more. now you can't do that inside notebook glen

00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,810
directly, so it's a pretty powerful tool. and then if we get into the cell, it will start to do that and start to work its

00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:03,730
magic. now if we go back to notebook glen it's still doing the deep research, as you can see right here. but yeah, google

00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,610
has just dropped like tons of new updates to notebook, glen, and here's. the thing: like most people have no idea these even

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,930
exist yet, right? now we're just testing these updates together. i haven't used all of them, but you're watching me discover

00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:18,650
them in real time. and we've looked at, for example, the deep research agent. you can also use image uploads inside notebook

00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:24,990
glen as well, right? so if we go inside here, we can start plugging in sources here. and if we go inside this section, we

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:30,810
can click on add sources, and you can see that you can actually upload images as a source, right? now this is pretty cool

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,970
because then you can actually use images and use that as training data for your systems. let me show you an example why that'd

00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:42,870
be useful. so let's say, for example, you wanted to automate creating facebook ads, right? and you already create a lot of

00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:48,350
facebook ads copy. be like, okay i want to use even more of this to generate better outputs." let me show you what i mean.

00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:55,150
so we can take a recent facebook ad from some of my campaigns, and then it's the copy that we write inside the ad, plus the

00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:01,010
creative, right? so we can take that like so. we can copy that. we can actually upload that as a file inside here, right?

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:09,150
so if we x off here, go to create new, upload that screenshot, and that's actually training the notebook glen on the ads campaign

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,870
that we've just built. why is that useful? it's useful because now we can automate anything that's image-based to create more

00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:21,770
or better related media. right now, you got to see, love glen it's not just like a chatbot like gemini or a custom gpt or

00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:27,350
whatever. this is more like a media station where you can, for example, generate audio views or video views and that sort

00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:32,730
of thing. now i'm going to show you why that's important in a minute. but in the meantime, let's go back to the deep research

00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,910
that is now completed. that took a few minutes. you can open up the sources it's generated here. if you don't like any of

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,510
them, you can unclick them. like and now this is going to use all the deep research we've built using nsn so you can see here

00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:50,370
we've got 38 sources inside our nsn research. we can click import, and that will now train the notebook glen on all that information

00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:57,530
around around nsn and ai automation. now why is that useful? it's useful because now we can actually ask a custom trained

00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,790
nsn automation expert, which is all the best access to all the best resources on the internet for nsn and use that to help

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,370
us build stuff out. all right, we'll come back to that in a second. let's see what else we got here. spawner says, nice session,

00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,050
thank you very much." fairly says, notebook glen is the best research tool on the market right now, so helpful." yeah i would

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,710
agree with that. i think it is incredibly powerful and helpful, right? as you can see here, for example, we've now got the

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:26,750
notebook lm nsn automation expert. now if we wanted to understand how nsn works, we can click on infographic, right? or if

00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:33,290
we wanted to really master the art of nsn we could actually create flashcards or a quiz based on that. so we could quiz ourselves

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:39,030
on an nsn and we could learn things really quickly based on that, right? what we can also do here is we could go inside here

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:46,790
and say, okay how do i build an ai agent on nsn right and that's a super simple question, but you could go as in-depth as

00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:54,090
you needed to, right? now once whilst waiting for that, we're still training the notebook on this ad image. but once that's

00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:03,610
done, we'd be able to ask it to add or infographics, etc. we could actually take that facebook ad image that we're training

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:09,870
the custom notebook lamp on, and then from here, we could even generate, for example, a video sales letter using the video

00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,990
view section, and that could like pair with what you're doing right now. so yeah, there you go. mac says, yeah i did a whole

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,030
teardown using that strategy from prompts chat to the custom gpt prompts for the seven cards." all right, so now we've got

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:27,730
the example here based on the information that it has. here's how you build a ai agent using nsn and then it's given the information.

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:33,850
like you set up the trigger, then you connect the chat model, right? then you connect the tools, etc. and what we can do over

00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:38,670
here as well is create like a nice slide deck, so like a powerpoint presentation about that topic. so let's say, for example,

00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,890
you are presenting on a particular topic, and let's say you're a content creator, or let's say you've got loads of information

00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,910
about this topic, and you need to organize it all together. you could upload all your documents on the left-hand side, then

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,710
ask nsn to generate a slide deck using that custom training information in order to create a powerful presentation that you're

00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,530
good to go on, right? super simple and easy. wait it takes images also now too? yeah that's something that's new but pretty

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,850
amazing. and you can see here as well, we can generate video views, my maps, etc. by the way, if you want to get all the video

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:11,350
notes from today, it's all inside the ai successor lab where you can connect with 40,000 members, as you can see in post inside

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:16,650
the community. get help, etc. people introducing themselves and sharing cool stuff and that sort of thing. if you go to the

00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:23,130
classroom here, then you go to december 2025. so this is brand new. all this stuff is brand new and newly updated, etc. and

00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:29,690
you can see the video notes from today inside the ai successor lab so. that's all available to you along with many other tutorials,

00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,970
right? i mean, this is one of the most powerful resources on the planet for research, and it's completely free. if you want

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,530
to get access to that notebook clip, you can also, for example, check out this quiz. so you see here, what is the primary

00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:45,870
metric, blah blah, and then you can just go through here and select whichever one you want and test yourself, right? so you

00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,390
can see if you actually know what you're talking about or not. and then let me paint you a picture. so this is a research

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:56,130
every entrepreneur knows, right? you're trying to create content about your topic. maybe it's for a client, maybe it's for

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,390
your own business, maybe you're just trying to understand something new in your industry. so what do you do? you might have

00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:06,130
47 browser tabs open. you copy and paste into google doc you watch youtube videos and take notes. you screenshot things from

00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:13,230
x right? you save pdfs that you'll read later. and three hours later, you're drowning in information with no clear answer.

00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:19,190
your brain is fried. you still haven't created anything, and you're not even sure if the information you found out is good

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,610
or not. that is the old way, right? and the old way, this is how things used to work. is like you have to find every article,

00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:31,090
video, and document yourself, right? there was no image support. you had sources cluttered everything, right? you have to

00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:37,410
start from scratch every time. no chat history. you couldn't combine like different resources and that sort of thing together.

00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:42,510
whereas now, with the new update from notebook on that google just dropped, you can use a deep research agent. so you just

00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:48,050
tell it what you want to know, and it finds and analyzes like over 20 sources automatically. you can use image uploads like

00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:54,450
screenshots, stem diagrams, and visual data as a searchable source. you can clean up everything in one click. so you can just

00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,770
import all the sources i've shown you today, like the deep research that we did for this natan agent. you can take photos

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:05,530
and add sources from your phone. you can also combine knowledge from different projects inside gemini like we did today, right?

00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,510
you can see how we created this nice little landing page based on multiple different notebooks at the top. it looks pretty

00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:15,830
nice, right? that looks pretty. and then you can have custom outputs. so for example, infographic, select videos in different

00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,250
visual styles. and so it's pretty amazing what you can build with this stuff. this looks super nice as well. and how quick

00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,990
and easy was it to do? super fast, right? you can see that we built a quiz, and we can just learn anything that we want or

00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:31,490
research anything that we want, manage it really well, right? so some people think like they need to manually find every source

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,890
themselves when they're using research tools. and here's what most people think: if you want good research, you have to hunt

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,230
down every single source yourself. maybe people think like they need to know where to look, or you need to spend hours researching.

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,610
and that's what i used to think too. but it's what actually happens when you use deep research. you type one sentence about

00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:50,470
what you want to know. the agent goes out and finds 20 relevant resources. it reads them all, creates a comparative report,

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:56,150
citations, imports sources into your notebook, all in about five minutes. and so the real problem isn't finding sources. the

00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:01,830
real problem is like wasting hours doing what an agent can do in minutes, right? and notebook is like one of the most powerful

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:07,830
tools i've ever seen. robbie says, woo just joined. good to see." it all right, cool. and yeah, let's talk about the Goldie

00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,910
Research Acceleration System all. right, so what the system actually does, this is how you turn any topic into complete research

00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:18,910
content assets and presentations in under 30 days using notebook lm's new features. most people use notebook lm to ask basic

00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:25,230
questions. that's like buying a car and using it to sit in your driveway. this system shows you the difference between using

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:31,750
a tool and actually leveraging it to build business assets. and the core concept here is like you've got one research hop

00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:37,490
with multiple outputs, right? so if you go on to this, for example, you can even create like a data table inside notebook

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,030
lm and this is on the na10 agent, as you can see. but basically, the old way was like different files scattered everywhere,

00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,170
no connection between your research and your content. and the new way is one notebook becomes your research hop. so everything

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:54,030
that you create flows from that single source of truth. and you upload sources once, then you extract research reports for

00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:00,190
your own understanding, infographics for social media, slide decks for client presentations, videos for content marketing,

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:06,250
and organized notes for articles or scripts. it's the same research, but you get multiple formats with maximum leverage. and

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,530
this works for you specifically because if you're watching this, you probably have a smaller business, and you want to learn

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,490
a automation, but you don't want to hire loads of people to help you, right? because that would be a nightmare. and so maybe

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,230
you don't have a research team, you don't have a content team, you don't have a design team, but you're one person trying

00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:24,450
to stay informed in your industry, create content consistently, look professional to clients, and actually deliver your core

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,150
service. and so this amount showing you gives you a research team, a content team, and design team capabilities without hiring

00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:36,370
anyone. that is the entire point, my friends. all right, so if we go to this notebook, as you can see, we've automated the

00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:42,250
infographic, and now you don't need a designer, right? you've got this nsn method right here that's basically taken all the

00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,570
information from our notebook and then turned it into a beautiful infographic, right? you see we've got the slide generator

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,970
over here. we have the data table method for research. we also have the mind map, right? so you can explore whatever you want

00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,910
inside here. so let's say you want to go deeper on ai and agenda workflows. you can do it like this. then you can open that

00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,790
up and go deeper and deeper as you want to. and then you've even got the quiz that we talked about earlier, where you can

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:08,370
test yourself based on what you learn it. and then you see here it's generating the video, the audio, and the slide deck,

00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:14,030
but they tend to take a bit more time, right? that tends to take a lot longer to generate. here's an example, right? so if

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:20,210
we actually open this up, you can see, for example, we have the video right here. so this is a video that's generated and

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,230
animated based on the information we've loaded, right? and it's actually a narrated video that we've automated using the research

00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,050
as well, right? now if you want a 30-day plan for implementing this stuff, we'll actually put it inside the ai success lab

00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,410
link in the comments description. inside there, you'll be able to connect with 40,000 different ai entrepreneurs who are trying

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:41,910
to grow and scale with ai automation. you can post inside the community, connect with cool people inside the classroom here.

00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,730
if you go to december 2025, you'll get all the video notes from today, and you can just read through and implement the 30-day

00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:52,250
plan, as you can see right here. and it gives you homework for every single stage of the process, which is pretty amazing.

00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:57,990
so super actionable, easy to implement. you learn exactly what to do. i've given you some example prompt packs as well. so

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:04,350
for example, i've given you a prompt pack for research report generation, content creation, client and business use. and there's

00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:09,550
stuff that i could build for my own business. for example, i have an seo agency, so i could create notebooks for each major

00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:15,330
seo update or algorithmic change, ai tool evaluation process. when google releases new tools, like for example, these notebook

00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:23,970
lm updates, i could create a notebook with the announcement posts, early user reviews, comparison articles, and the can give

00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:29,370
me a complete analysis, which i can turn into content for my live streams or infographics for my community or training materials,

00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:34,230
right? and so, you can see how powerful this stuff is. most people fail with ai tools because they're using like search engines.

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:40,310
one question, one answer, move on. this system builds a knowledge asset that grows more valuable over time because every source

00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:46,650
you add makes this notebook smarter, right? and every output you generate is based on comprehensive research, not surface-level

00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:52,310
prompts. and every notebook becomes a specialist that you can consult instantly. that's the difference between using a tool

00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:57,650
and building a system. and don't measure this by how good is the infographic, correct? that's not the way to look at this.

00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:03,360
you want to measure it by how much time did you save. on research per week, what client education materials you can create

00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,120
in minutes instead of days? what's the quality of answers when prospects ask you tough questions? what's the speed of content

00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,540
creation when you need to post something valuable? and i've given a list of like common mistakes to avoid. but you can see

00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,820
here how you can navigate after that 30-day plan that you've implemented, that i've shown you a second ago. by day 30, you'll

00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:24,180
have five to ten active notebooks on different topics, a library of generated infographics, slide decks, and videos, a weekly

00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:30,080
routine for adding source and creating outputs, client-facing materials ready to use, elite magnets that are actively generating

00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,980
you new audiences and new potential customers. all right, now if you want to see some examples of how people winning with

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:42,720
this source, you can see our AI Profit Boarding testimonial document here. it's got over 106 pages, not 106 testimonials,

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:50,600
106 pages of testimonials from people winning with AI automation inside the AI Profit Boarding. let's just scroll to a random

00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:57,060
example. for example, here i actually built out an amazing tool, and Gerson said, wow thanks! this would make a huge difference

00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,100
for all. it's i really appreciate and now i have direction. will continue to learn from the courses laid out here. appreciate

00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:08,360
it." for example, here Nora asking for a content humanizer. i sent her a link. as you can see, Nora says, thanks used it,

00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,600
and it worked pretty amazing." Paolo, happy to share with you, just create my first avatar, and we'll start sharing insights

00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,480
and social media platforms using it. comments critiques are welcome. thanks Julian, for inspiring us. so like, my goal is

00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,340
really just to help as many people as i can on the planet with automation. and if you want to learn this stuff, you can get

00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,360
it inside the AI Profit Boarding here. all right, so let's talk about what you actually get when you join the AI Profit Boarding.

00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,000
see what's happening. i'm teaching all this stuff about Noble GLAM. we're testing these tools live. you'll see how it works.

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,740
but you know what? that's just one single tool. and if you leave here today with just knowledge about Noble GLAM, you're still

00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,380
stuck with the same problem you had before, right? with just too many tools, not enough systems, and no clear path forward.

00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,160
so here's what i built: the AI Profit Boarding, where solopreneurs and small agency owners come to turn scattered AI knowledge

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,780
into actual business systems that save time and get you more customers. right and so what you're going to get is the complete

00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:01,240
AI Profit Boarding training library. this includes the 85 formula for cutting work, to complete AI automation ecosystems for

00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:06,620
Google, including Gemini, Noble GLAM, AI Studio, and Workspace, automation setup training for NHSN, make and other platforms,

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,000
content creation systems that works all the stuff i do is based on that. lead generation automation frameworks and SEO and

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,480
traffic strategies, right? and inside the AI Profit Boarding, you can get inside the classroom all of these different trainings,

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,780
as you can see right here. now one of the best things about this is the daily accountability. so you can post your goals and

00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,620
what you're going to work on today. hold each other accountable, learn and grow together, as you can see. and then inside

00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,500
the community here, if you get questions, if you want to share stuff, for example, look at this. right Paris said, this is

00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:39,000
how powerful AI is." right and you can see how powerful this is based on this post shared right here. and people are just

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,260
sharing new cool stuff like this all the time. so we're learning and growing. we're winning. but we also do daily check-ins,

00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:49,440
weekly deep dives, and monthly strategy goals so that you're not learning alone, right? you're in a community of people building

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,280
the same systems that you are. plus you can jump on camera with me on my team during coaching calls, like you see today. also

00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,240
if you get stuck on something, you can message me directly inside the AI Profit Boarding. so you can DM me, as you can see

00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,160
right here. ask me any questions, and that means that I answer member questions throughout the day. no waiting for the next

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,140
group call. no posting in the forum hoping someone responds. top of that, you get unlimited tech support, right? so our team

00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:16,060
helps you troubleshoot, set up automations, and solve technical problems. and you don't need to figure this out alone. and

00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,520
then you also get ready-to-use templates and prompts. every training comes with these app prompts, templates, and frameworks

00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,360
to use. you don't need to start from scratch; you just copy what works. so for example, inside here, if you go to classroom,

00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:31,080
inside the playbook, you can learn how to, for example, create AI avatar videos, like you can see right here. you can learn

00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,800
how to, for example, generate leads from Instagram shorts. how I create shorts on YouTube that are AI generated and get tons

00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,900
of views. right let's have a look. for example, if we go on to my shorts recently here, you can see all the shorts were posted,

00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:49,320
and most of these are generated. check this one out: 66,000 views on this AI generated short on YouTube. so you know, the

00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,780
more people you reach, the more people that know about your business, the better you do, right? how can you reach more people?

00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:59,780
you can use systems like this to basically automate content creation. so that's all inside the AI Profit Boarding. link in

00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:06,120
the comments description. how to do ARSEO with notebook LM, which is a super powerful and free tool you can use. you can actually

00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,420
combine it with Gemini now as well.

00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:13,740
I'll show you what I mean in a second. and if you love notebook you're going love this video, I think. so what you see here

00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,060
is this a traffic chart of juliangolder.com, and you can see with AISEO, we're like, we're just getting awesome results. we've

00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:25,860
taken this website from literally zero clicks per day to getting thousands of clicks with AISEO, as you can see. and you can

00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,860
see the traffic chart is just popping off right now. so it's growing up really nicely. we generate traffic to this website,

00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:37,940
and obviously, this funnels traffic to our agency, as you can see. so we're posting blogs on the blog over here all the time,

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,860
and these pages actually rank in traffic and do well. all right, so if you want to steal the processes work for me personally,

00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:49,700
then you can get this today. all right, so if you never checked out notebook LM, this is what it looks like. it's a free tool

00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:55,880
within limits, and on notebooklm.google, you can get access to it. and then you can go inside here and get all these featured

00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:01,600
notebooks. now you can do the basics, right? so for example, let's say I wanted to create a new notebook and then generate

00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,260
some SEO content for that, right? let me show you how that works. we're going to go to YouTube here.

00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm going to pull in some sources that I can create content around. so for example, let's say I want to create a blog about,

00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:16,420
I don't know, genspark right? so I'm going to take the transcript. we'll plug that into notebooklm in fact, you know what?

00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,860
I'll just copy the video, and then we can load the video. and from here, we have to load in our sources. so I'm going to click

00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:27,360
on YouTube up here. all right? and then what I'm also going to do is I'm going to add a new source, right? to add sources, we're going to plug in website.

00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:33,960
I'm just going to plug in my website URL, and basically, this will custom train the notebook on genspark and the new update,

00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,080
which we're going to create content around. and then also my website, which is where I want to funnel traffic to, right? and

00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,280
so it's concentrating on YSL and also the latest update that I want to create content around for SEO. so from here, what we

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,160
can do is we can then take this notebook and create, for example, a video of you that we actually rank directly on YouTube,

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,340
right? so if we type in that, like so, it will start to generate that. now why is that what it's important? because you can

00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:03,020
actually get a lot of traffic directly from YouTube itself, right? so for example, if we type in like notebook SEO, you can

00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,720
see that I'm ranking directly on YouTube for that particular keyword. all right, that's great. and so you can create videos

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,500
from notebook LM, and then you could actually upload those to YouTube directly and rank them on YouTube. now the other cool

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,320
thing about this is if we go on to Google, we can see that we also rank number one for that keyword several times, right?

00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,820
so for notebook LM SEO, right? and so the video that you create from notebook LM can actually rank directly on YouTube and

00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:32,060
also directly on Google, right? nice that's pretty cool. all right, now if we go on to perplexy this should also rank inside

00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:38,300
AI search engines as well. all right, so if we type in notebook LM SEO over here and we'll search on perplexy and it's being

00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,160
super buggy, but we'll see what it does in a sec. maybe it's broken. if not, we'll go to chat your team generally, and you

00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:50,100
can see that actually uses sources from YouTube to generate the outputs inside, right? so for example, it's actually used,

00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:56,540
for example, my video here as a source inside perplexy and so when. you're generating these videos or when you're creating

00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,780
content on YouTube around that particular topic, you rank in inside YouTube, on Google, and directly inside search engines

00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,740
as well, right? as a source, pretty insane. and so one video can rank multiple times. how to generate the video? you can just

00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:14,380
generate a video overview inside notebook LM, or you could use some of the AI efforts to teach inside the AI proctor boardroom

00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,520
as well. now what you can also do is you could go inside here and you could take a prompt. this is one of my favorite prompts

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,260
from the AI proctor boardroom and you can take this prompt like that. we can type in the topic we want to rank for. so example:

00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,340
genspark AI update. we'll take that, and it's actually going to analyze the sources from here and then generate a blog post

00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:35,880
based on that particular topic. all right, so we've custom trained our sources. now we need to create a blog post. how do

00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,740
we create the blog post? we can use a prompt like this. it's inside the AI proctor boardroom if you want to steal it. and

00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:45,880
then you can see this generate a whole blog for that particular topic. all right? and so then inside notebook you can generate

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:53,060
the topic itself, plus you can generate the video, right? so a blog and a video that's going to rank directly on google and

00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:59,080
AI search engines like publicity as you can see right here. now here's another example what you can do. so you can actually

00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,360
load the notebook. it's a nice little hack just came out this week, right? so we can take that notebook that's custom trained

00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,140
on the sources we want to create content around. we can plug that in, and then what we can actually do here that's really

00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:15,940
interesting is we can rank custom tools that we build on an exact match domain on google for that particular keyword. let

00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:20,600
me show you what i mean. so if we go into ahs and let's say you want to rank directly on google for a keyword, let's say for

00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,400
example, enterprise seoi calculator. you get 600 searches per month, so that's 6,000 searches per year if you write for it.

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,760
that would be great, right? now you can actually see a website that i've custom built with AI ranking number one for that

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,480
particular keyword, right? and it funnels traffic to book in an SEO strategy session with my agency. so we can use this as

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,960
a way to generate more leads, and all we have to do is create a simple tool on an exact match domain. for example, like if

00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,720
the keyword is enterprise seoi calculator, then we just create a website called enterprise seoi calculator. and then from

00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:55,420
there, we can start working our magic, right? and so how would we do this with notebook let we can take in the notebook that

00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:03,100
we've just generated, so notebook and then we can go to tools canvas right? and we can say, okay create a custom sass tool

00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:13,280
about the new genspark ai update plus have a cta on page to funnel traffic to the ai profit boardroom which is here via this

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:19,260
link." all right? so create a custom sass tool, the update, plus have a cta on the page to funnel traffic to there, right?

00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:25,720
and then from here, what we're also going to say optimize the landing page content plus headlines, etc., to get the keyword

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,900
genspark ai update, right? and so just to recap here, we can create a custom sass tool that ranks number one for our exact

00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,960
match domain. so if our keyword is this, we would create an exact match domain for that, right? and then we can rank it on

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,120
google funnel traffic to our website, and all we need to do is create one single page that can rank, right? how do we do that?

00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:48,040
we can load in the notebook plus generate a tool on canvas so we're going to click enter like so, and that will start generating

00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:53,900
the tool inside canvas based on the notebook that we've got over here. and we're good to go on this. standby loading says,

00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,480
good morning! i have a question. when i have a lot of information, but i want to separate a part of them for a video, how

00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,120
does it work?" my result? yeah all right. so if you want to generate a video inside notebook alemba you want to separate the

00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,400
information. what you can do is inside notebook alemba here, with the sources loaded and your notebook custom trained, you

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,400
can go to video overview. but you're going to click on edit here, and then you can actually change the design visual style.

00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,700
if you're from germany so for example, standby loading, i know you're from germany so we can go to germany and create the

00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,960
content in german i believe. oh yeah, deutsch so you can use deutsch i guess, right? and then from here, we'll switch back

00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,120
to english but we can choose our custom design like this. we can choose between whether it's a brief video or an explainer.

00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,760
i would recommend going with the explainer. and then here, you tell it what to focus on, right? so if you have individual

00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:41,360
pieces of information that you want to generate, like standby loading does, you just put it inside the custom instructions,

00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,880
and you tell it exactly what to focus on. and that's how it works, right? super easy and simple. so then inside of canvas

00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,200
we now have the tool, as you can see. we can share that. but the main thing is here, you want to get the code, save it as

00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:58,240
a file offline, and then upload it to netlify so you can host it, right? that's what i did for the page that you can see here.

00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,380
we actually coded this with bolt but using this node new notebook lm framework, you can use notebook lm instead to generate

00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,400
the outputs. so it's simple, super simple and easy. and then you can see the here we can test it out. we can create a report,

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,340
etc. you see how it's got a cta to join the air profit boardroom at the top. click on that, it goes straight to our landing

00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:21,100
page. boom shaka laka, my friends! and then it's got cta at the bottom as well, as you can see. so anyone who lands on this

00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,580
page is interested about ai what would be the natural next step? join our automation community where they can learn new workflows

00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,460
and implement this stuff inside their business. and so it links naturally together, and it funnels traffic from that keyword

00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,520
to this that much domain and from the exact match domain to our funnels where we generate clients and customers. and that's

00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:42,380
what... all right, pk says, good morning! a bit different question. what's your ai tool stack that you recommend called code

00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,240
max cursor and gemini there are so many changes, that's hard to determine what's best." all right, so if you go to the ai

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,960
profit board all right, once you're in the start here section. so in the start here section, here, if you want to know what

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,480
tools i use, i actually have an updated tools list here. i'm not going to share it because if someone's watching this video,

00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,980
that changes, and we update it as we go along. but if you want to know what tools i personally use so you don't feel overwhelmed,

00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:09,480
get it inside the air profit boarding start here post. right what you want to see is that when new updates come out, i review

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,960
them. so i spend about 80 hours a week testing, and my team spends about eight hours a week testing. we condense all those

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,800
hours of testing into a five-minute update where you can quickly learn what to focus on here. so for example, like july you

00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,420
can see back in july we broke down, okay here are the new updates. here's why i've created this. here's my top three most

00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,360
useful this week. here's some decent stuff, and here's the stuff to completely ignore." right and so we. break down the most

00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,500
important updates, and then we keep you updated like that. and that's the best way to stay up to date because you can get

00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,540
the latest tools that i'm using, my tool stack, and that's updated week to week, day to day. and then also, you get the weekly

00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:46,480
updates, which you can feel down to here and just learn what's worth your time and what to skip. that's some of the best stuff.

00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,960
flatland says, great content! using ai i've created a lot of real professional stuff. kayak website, awesome for you! good

00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:57,340
to see you!" and yeah, that's basically how you can use this stuff, right? so if we go back to notebook i was stuffing great,

00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,580
like reports. this another cool thing as well. you can actually create infographic and images can rank really well for particular

00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:08,720
keywords, right? so if i type in notebook glen asio yes, we'll rank in on the first page of google for that particular keyword.

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,520
all right? and also, my website is ranking first page as well. so this is interesting too, right? this is really interesting.

00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,500
all right, so we're basically dominating the first page of google because we're creating videos about that topic, like i showed

00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,160
you how to do with notebook we're creating blog posts about the topic, like i've shown you to do with notebook right we're

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:30,340
actually creating school posts that rank on the first page as well, which is pretty cool. so it generates traffic to my community.

00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:37,380
we also create unique posts and create them and post them on linkedin and then share that information too. all right? and

00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,020
you can see, for example, if you have a look at this page, i see how many how much traffic you got. yes you got 128 views,

00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:49,220
which is not bad. oh there we go! 741 article views, pretty insane, right? so we get a lot of people looking at that content,

00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:54,120
and then you can see how easy it is to rank. like another video ranking down there as well. all right? so you can rank multiple

00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,980
times on the first page google for the keyword that you're targeting using these methods that i'm showing you today. covered

00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,800
a lot. all right? and then also, you can create these exact match domains that rank for the tools as well. so that's basically

00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:09,900
my master class on how to use notebook for aico if you want to get a free seo strategy session, you can get that Julian Goldie

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:46,720
in the comments description. google just dropped something crazy with notebook, lm, ultra, this. thing can now handle 600

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:54,740
sources in one notebook. you get watermark-free slide decks and way more power. if you use ai for research or content, this

00:59:54,740 --> 01:00:00,940
changes everything. let me show you what just happened. all right, so notebook lm just got a massive upgrade. and i'm talking

01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:08,340
game-changing stuff here. google put notebook lm inside their ai ultra plan. that's their top-tier subscription. and when

01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:14,320
i saw what they added, i had to make this video because if you're doing research, making content, or building presentations,

01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:21,200
this update is wild. let me break down what just happened. and stick around because i'll show you exactly how to use this

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:29,080
stuff. so first, notebook lm is google's ai research tool. you upload sources like pdfs articles, videos, whatever. then it

01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:37,600
makes summaries, slide decks, infographics, even audio and video overviews. it's basically an ai research assistant that does

01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:45,180
all the heavy lifting for you. now here's what changed. google just rolled notebook lm into their ai ultra subscription. this

01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:52,420
is huge. you now get access to gemini's most powerful models inside notebook lm we're talking the absolute best ai google

01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:59,900
has. faster processing, smarter outputs, deeper reasoning on everything you feed it. but the model upgrade is just the start.

01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:07,840
let's talk about limits. before ultra the free version gave you 50 sources per notebook. the pro version gave you 300. ultra

01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:14,680
you get 600 sources per notebook. think about that for a second. you can dump entire research libraries into one notebook.

01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:23,330
hundreds of pdfs dozens of every article you've ever saved, all in one place, all processed by ai this matters because most

01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:30,970
people hit the source limit fast. you're researching a topic, you add 20 articles, then 30 more, then some pdfs boom you're

01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:37,150
maxed out. with 600 sources, that problem is gone. you can build massive knowledge bases that actually work. and it's not

01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:45,710
just sources. ultra massively increases your usage limits across audio overviews, way more video overviews, way more deep

01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:52,650
research sessions, way more slide deck and infographic generation, way more. google didn't give exact numbers, but they said

01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:58,190
the increases are huge. we're talking professional-level capacity here. now let's talk outputs. this is where it gets really

01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:04,250
good. ultra removes watermarks from your slide decks and infographics. that means when you generate a presentation, it's clean.

01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:10,090
no google branding, no watermarks, just professional-ready materials you can use in meetings, pitches, client presentations,

01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:16,210
whatever. you look like you spent hours making it when it took you five minutes. and here's something else. ultra brought

01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:22,790
back the long option for slide decks. before you could only make short summary decks. now you can generate full, detailed

01:02:22,790 --> 01:02:29,210
presentations. we're talking comprehensive decks with tons of slides, perfect for lectures, workshops, deep dives, anything

01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:36,470
where you need real substance. now i want to talk about something. if you're serious about using tools like notebook lm ultra

01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:43,450
to scale your business, save time, and automate your workflows, you need to check out my ai profit boardroom this. is where

01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:49,490
i show you how to use ai tools like notebook lm and dozens of others to actually grow your business and get more customers.

01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:56,650
we cover automation strategies, ai workflows, and real tactics that save you hundreds of hours. it's the best place to learn

01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:05,930
how to turn these tools into actual business results. link is the description. back to it. so who is this for? ultra is built

01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:13,150
for power users, researchers who need to process tons of information, content creators making videos and courses, business

01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:20,330
analysts building reports, students handling heavy coursework, anyone who uses notebook lm seriously and hits those limits.

01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:27,450
if you're casual, the free or pro versions are fine. but if you're doing real work, ultra is the move. say you're a student

01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:34,550
writing a thesis. you've got 100 sources to review: books, journals, articles, interviews. you dump them all into ultra then

01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:41,530
you ask notebook lm to summarize each source, pull out key quotes, find connections between sources, generate an audio overview

01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:47,590
you can listen to while driving, then create an infographic showing how all the ideas connect. all of that happens automatically.

01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:55,250
you just saved yourself weeks of work. all right, so how do you get ultra you need to subscribe to google's ai ultra plan.

01:03:55,250 --> 01:04:03,230
this is their premium tier. it includes ultra access for notebook lm plus their other ai tools. you can't just buy notebook

01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:10,510
lm ultra by itself. it's part of the whole package. google is bundling everything together. smart move on their part. now

01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:17,450
let me give you some pro tips for using ultra first maximize your sources. don't just add a few articles. go deep. add everything

01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:23,970
relevant. the more sources you add, the better notebook lm understands your topic. it can make connections across sources,

01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:32,150
pull insights from multiple places, give you way outputs. second customize your video and audio overviews. you can give notebook

01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:38,870
lm specific prompts. tell it what angle to focus on, what tone to use, what points to emphasize. don't just hit generate and

01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:45,990
hope for the best. guide it. you'll get way better results. third use long slide decks for anything serious: client pitches,

01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:52,330
lectures, training materials, workshops. the long format gives you real depth. you're not stuck with surface-level summaries.

01:04:52,330 --> 01:05:00,850
you get comprehensive presentations that actually deliver value. fourth experiment with deep research. this feature lets notebook

01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:08,170
lm dive into specific questions. it pulls from all your sources, synthesizes information, gives you detailed answers with

01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:14,670
citations. it's like having a research assistant that actually knows your material. fifth combined features. don't just use

01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:21,450
one thing. generate a slide deck, then make a video overview explaining the deck. then create an infographic summarizing the

01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:28,250
key points. then use deep research to answer questions people might have. stack these features together and you've got a complete

01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:35,410
content system. here's the thing. notebook lm ultra isn't just a note-taking tool anymore. it's a full research and content

01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:41,970
engine. you can feed it massive amounts of information, then turn that information into every format you need: presentations,

01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:49,630
videos, audio, infographics, reports. all professional quality, all fast, all automated. and because you're using gemini's

01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:55,670
best models, the quality is top tier. the summaries are accurate, the presentations make sense, the overviews sound natural.

01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:02,570
it's not just spitting out generic ai slop. it's actually processing your specific sources and creating useful outputs. now

01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:08,010
i know some people are thinking, is this worth paying for? here's my take. if you're doing serious research or content work,

01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:14,330
yes. the time you save pays for itself immediately. think about how long it takes to read 100 sources, pull out key points,

01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:21,130
create a presentation, write a script, make an infographic. you're looking at days or weeks of work. ultra does it in minutes.

01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:27,650
the roi is obvious. but if you're just taking notes or doing light research, maybe not. the free version or pro might be enough.

01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:34,590
ultra is for people who need scale, who hit limits, who are building real projects with ai one more thing. ultra gives you

01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:42,010
priority access to new features. when google releases something new for notebook lm ultra users get it first. that's huge.

01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:48,690
if you want to stay ahead, you're not waiting months for features to roll out. you get them. so bottom line. notebook lm ultra

01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:57,590
is a massive upgrade: 600 sources, better models, higher limits, professional outputs, watermark removal, long slide decks.

01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:04,270
this turns notebook lm from a nice tool into a serious productivity weapon. if you're doing research, creating content, or

01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:10,030
building presentations, this is worth checking out. now i want to talk about something important. if you're serious about

01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:08,150
went from cute note-taking app to absolute monster. they twinix the customization limit, and it's completely free. i'm about

01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:15,850
to show you how to turn your boring documents into genius-level ai assistants. this is wild. all right, so december 4th, 2025,

01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:22,190
google quietly released an update that's going to change everything. notebook lm just expanded their chat customization from

01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:28,370
500 characters to 10,000 characters. and i know what you're thinking: who cares about character limits, right? wrong this

01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:34,650
is massive because now you can turn notebook lm into basically any expert you want: product managers, teachers, scientists,

01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:42,610
seo specialists, whatever. you and it grounds every response in your document. so no hallucinations, no made-up facts, just

01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:50,110
pure accurate insights from your own sources. let me show you why this is absolutely insane. before this update, you had 500

01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:56,250
characters to describe what you wanted. that's like two sentences. you couldn't build detailed personas. you couldn't set

01:08:56,250 --> 01:09:03,310
specific formats. you couldn't create real expert-level assistants. now 10 000 characters, that's enough to build incredibly

01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:10,170
detailed instructions with specific tone of voice, exact output formats, constraints, and rules. everything you need to make

01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:18,030
ai actually useful. and here's the best part: it's completely free. no credit card, no subscription. just go to notebooklm.google.com,

01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:23,610
and you're ready. now let me show you three examples that google shared when they announced this update. and i'm going to

01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:30,470
demo these live so you can see exactly how powerful this is. first example is a ruthless product manager. this persona gives

01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:36,530
you decision memos. it looks at your documents and tells you what's actually going on with user evidence, feasibility checks,

01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:43,150
blind spots you missed, and contradictions in your data. it's like having a senior pm review everything you upload. second

01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:51,530
example is a middle school teacher. this one breaks down complex topics into kid-friendly explanations. it gives you analogies,

01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:59,170
vocabulary lists, and true or false quizzes. perfect for educators or anyone learning new subjects. third example is a scientific

01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:06,350
researcher. this persona analyzes papers with academic rigor, giving you key findings, methodological strengths and weaknesses,

01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:13,810
and contradictions with proper citations. it's phd level analysis without the phd now i'm going to show you these in action.

01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:21,790
but first, let me tell you how to access this. go to notebooklm.google.com and upload your documents: pdfs text files, whatever

01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:28,210
you have. then click the gear icon in the chat, and you'll see a custom prompt field. that's where the magic happens. that

01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:34,510
field now supports 10,000 characters instead of 500, and that's where you paste these detailed persona prompts. all right,

01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:40,370
let me show you demo number one: the product manager persona. before i show you these demos, let me tell you about something

01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:46,690
that will take your ai skills to the next level. it's called ai profit boardroom and if. you're watching this video because

01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:53,450
you want to save time and work smarter with ai tools like notebook lm you need to check this out. artificial intelligence

01:10:53,450 --> 01:11:00,330
profit boardroom. teaches you how to automate your business processes using the latest ai tools. we're talking about saving

01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:06,470
hours every single day, streamlining your workflows, and getting more done with less effort. and the best part? you learn

01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:12,950
from real examples and practical strategies that actually work. no theory, no fluff, just actionable steps you can implement

01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:19,650
immediately. if you want to master tools like notebook lm and dozens of other ai platforms that can transform how you work,

01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:27,130
click the link in the description. ai profit boardroom is waiting for you. now back to these insane demos. okay product manager

01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:34,470
persona. i uploaded a sample roadmap document, just a basic product features list. now i'm pasting the exact prompt that google

01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:41,150
shared. it tells the ai to act as a ruthless product manager where every response must be a decision memo with user evidence

01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:48,030
bullets, feasibility checks, blind spots, and contradictions in a very specific format. now i'm asking it to review the q3

01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:54,910
features, and watch what happens. boom it gives me a full decision memo. the user evidence section shows which features customers

01:11:54,910 --> 01:12:01,010
actually ask for. feasibility checks highlight which ones are realistic versus pipe dreams. the blind spots section points

01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:06,630
out what we're missing, and contradictions it found two features that directly conflict with each other. this is insane. i

01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:13,250
just uploaded a document and got instant expert-level analysis. no back and forth, no vague responses, just actionable insights.

01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:20,590
and this works because the ai is grounded actual document. it's not making stuff up. it's analyzing what i gave it. okay demo

01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:27,510
2: the middle school teacher persona. i grabbed a science textbook section about photosynthesis. it's way too complex for

01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:35,150
most kids. i pasted the teacher prompt, which tells the ai to simplify everything, give analogies, create vocabulary lists,

01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:42,470
and add quizzes. i ask it to explain photosynthesis, and look at this output. first a tldr summary that's super simple: just

01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:49,610
plants make food using sunlight. then an analogy where photosynthesis is like a factory kitchen. the leaves of the kitchen,

01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:56,870
sunlight is the electricity, water and carbon dioxide are the ingredients, and glucose is the meal they cook. brilliant then

01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:04,310
a vocabulary list with chlorophyll, glucose, and stomata, each term explained in simple language. and at the end, a true or

01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:10,930
false quiz asking if plants need sunlight to make food. this is perfect for educators or anyone trying to learn. it breaks

01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:18,470
everything down, makes it digestible, and adds interactive elements, all from one prompt. now demo 3: the scientific researcher

01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:25,830
persona. i uploaded two biology research papers with dense academic stuff, methodology sections, and statistical analysis,

01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:33,250
the works. i pasted the researcher prompt, which demands formal academic analysis with key findings, with bold headers, strengths

01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:40,130
and weaknesses, and contradictions with citations. i ask about the methodology, and watch this. it gives me a structured breakdown

01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:47,490
with a bold section for key findings that lists the main methodological approaches from both papers. then a bold section for

01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:54,370
methodological strengths that points out robust sample sizes, proper control groups, and valid statistical tests. then a bold

01:13:54,370 --> 01:14:01,130
section for weaknesses that highlights potential confounding variables and limited generalizability. then the best part: a

01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:08,190
bold section for contradictions. it compares both papers and shows where they disagree with exact citations. paper one claims

01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:15,610
x paper two claims y and these contradict on this specific point. this is phd level analysis, and i got it in 30 seconds.

01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:22,070
now here's what makes this update so powerful. you can adapt these prompts for anything. marketing create an seo auditor persona

01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:29,270
that reviews your content, finds keyword gaps, and suggests improvements. legal make a contract analyze a persona that highlights

01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:36,490
risky clauses and suggests revisions. finance build a budget analyst persona that spots overspending and recommends cuts.

01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:42,750
the possibilities are endless. and because you're uploading your own documents, the ai stays accurate. it can't hallucinate

01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:50,070
facts. it can't make up data. everything comes from your sources. let me show you this table that breaks down the three sample

01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:57,290
personas. product manager is best for ruthless insights and needs about 800 characters minimum to define the structure. middle

01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:03,780
school teacher is perfect for kid-friendly explanations. with around 700 characters, plus quiz rules. scientific researcher

01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:11,340
is ideal for objective analysis, with about 900 characters for proper formality. all of these fit comfortably in the new 10,000

01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:17,700
character limit. so you can go way more detailed if you want. now let me give you some real-world use cases. if you're a content

01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:24,840
creator, build a video script reviewer where you upload your outlines and ask the ai to critique structure, pacing, and hooks.

01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:32,700
if you're a student, create an exam prep tutor where you upload your textbooks and get custom quizzes and study guides. if

01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:39,120
you're a business professional, make a contradiction finder where you upload reports from different departments and let the

01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:46,980
ai spot inconsistencies. this tool pairs with gemini 3; that's google's latest ai model. so you're getting cutting-edge performance

01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:54,180
for free. now here's a pro tip: don't use vague queries. the more specific your question, the better the response. instead

01:15:54,180 --> 01:16:01,120
of asking, to tell me about this document," ask, what are the three main contradictions in the methodology section?" for specifics

01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:07,400
and get better outputs. another tip is to copy and paste the exact prompts google shared. i'll link them in the description.

01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:13,940
start with those, test them, see how they work, then adapt them for your needs. change the tone, adjust the format, add your

01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:20,080
own constraints, and make it yours. and here's the biggest mistake people make: they forget to upload sources first. notebook

01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,760
lm needs documents to ground its responses. if you just chat without sources, you're wasting the main feature. always upload

01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:32,540
first, then customize your persona, then start asking questions. that's the workflow. now let's talk about why this matters.

01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:39,620
most ai tools are generic. chat gpt gives you generic responses. claude gives you generic responses. they try to be everything

01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:46,020
to everyone. notebook lm is different. it's an ai that becomes exactly what you need based on your documents, based on your

01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:52,580
instructions, based on your goals. it's personalized ai without the personalization tax. and with this 10,000 character limit,

01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:59,140
you can get incredibly specific. the old limit let you say, act like a teacher." the new limit lets you say, act like a middle

01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:05,660
school science teacher who uses pop culture references, breaks concepts into three-step processes, and ends every explanation

01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:12,180
with a quiz question that reinforces the core concept." see the difference? the old version was a suggestion. the new version

01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:20,060
is a complete persona with style, with structure, with rules. that's what 10,000 characters unlocks: real customization, real

01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:26,480
expertise, real value. and again, this is free. google isn't charging for this; they're just giving it away. google says,

01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:33,620
here take it. no credit card required." that's insane. now here's what you need to do right now: go to notebooklm.google.com

01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:39,960
and create an account. if you don't have one, upload a document you work with regularly. could be a report, a research paper,

01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,960
a client brief, whatever. and then go to the chat settings, click the gear icon, find the custom prompt field, and paste one

01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,680
of those sample prompts i showed you: product manager, teacher, researcher. pick one, test it, and ask a question about your

01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,740
doc. see what happens. you're going to be blown away because you're going to get expert-level insights from a free tool in

01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:05,400
about two minutes. and once you see how it works, start customizing. build your personas. create an seo expert, a legal advisor,

01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:12,700
a data analyst, whatever you need. the 10 000 character limit gives you room to be creative, to be specific, to build something

01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:18,660
actually useful. this isn't hype. this is a legitimate game changer, especially for people who work with lots of documents:

01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:26,160
researchers, students, business professionals, content creators, anyone who needs to extract insights from text. notebook

01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:33,120
lm just became your secret weapon. and with this update, it went from good to incredible. all right, before you go, one more

01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,440
click a button and it's done. today i'm showing you how notebook lm just became the most powerful content creation tool for

01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:33,620
seo and it's going to change everything. this is brand new. this is huge. and if you're still making content the old way,

01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:40,700
you're already behind. so notebook lm dropped four massive updates, and i'm not talking about small tweaks. i'm talking about

01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:48,160
features that turn this simple note-taking app into a full content studio. we're talking slide decks, infographics, deep research

01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:54,620
that searches hundreds of websites for you, and custom video styles that make your content look professional without touching

01:19:54,620 --> 01:20:01,200
a single design tool. let me break down what's actually happening here. notebook lm used to be just an AI assistant that helped

01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:07,320
you summarize documents. you'd upload a pdf and it would give you notes. that was it. but now, now it's completely different.

01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:17,180
you can upload your sources: pdfs google docs spreadsheets, even images of handwritten notes. and notebook lm builds an entire

01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:24,560
knowledge base from all of it. then here's where it gets crazy. from that same knowledge base, you can generate slides for

01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:31,500
a presentation, an infographic for social media, a video for youtube and a full research report with citations, all from the

01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:37,760
same sources you upload. your content, click slide deck, and boom! you get a full presentation ready to go. no manual work,

01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:44,180
no designing each slide, no copying and pasting bullet points. it's done. and the best part? the slides stick to your original

01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:50,480
content. they don't make stuff up. they don't hallucinate. they pull straight from your sources. so if you're doing client

01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:58,180
presentations, or webinars, or teaching a class, you just saved hours of work. the second update is infographics. these are

01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:04,140
visual summaries of complex information. you can choose if you want it vertical for instagram horizontal for a blog post,

01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:10,660
or square for linkedin you can control the colors, the layout, the number of key points, all through prompts. you just type

01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:17,160
what you want, and notebook lm creates it. this takes what used to be hours in canva or photoshop and turns it into seconds.

01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:23,620
you're going from research to design to share in literally minutes. now here's where it gets really interesting. the third

01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:30,920
update is deep research. this is wild. you give notebook lm a topic, it goes out and browses hundreds of websites. it compiles

01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:37,940
everything, it synthesizes the information, and it gives you back a structured report with citations, all automatically. and

01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:44,140
remember, you can also upload google sheets word docs, images, whatever you have. so you're building this massive knowledge

01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:51,720
base, and notebook lm is doing all the heavy lifting for seo research. game changer for school projects, unbeatable for content

01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:57,760
planning. this is what you've been waiting for. and one more thing: if you're creating all this content with notebook lm but

01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,960
nobody is finding it online, you've got a traffic problem. that's where seo comes in. if you want more leads, more traffic,

01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:10,960
and more sales, my team can help you rank higher on google check the link in the comments and description to order ai seo

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:17,880
online and let us handle your backlinks while you focus on growing your business. so back to it. the fourth update is custom

01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:24,520
video overview styles. notebook lm already had video overviews. those are like narrated slide shows made from your content.

01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:31,200
but now, you can type in custom style prompts. you want a modern tech vibe? type it. you want minimal black and white slides?

01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:37,700
type it. you want upbeat and professional for a global audience? type it. you're not stuck with generic videos anymore. you

01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:43,940
control the mood, the design, the entire look. and that means your content can actually match your brand instead of looking

01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:50,180
like everyone else's. let me show you how this all works together with a real example. let's say you want to create content

01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:56,980

01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:52,930
this massive knowledge base about learning guitar sitting in your notebook. step two: you click slide deck. here's what you

01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:51,830
this." notebook lm creates the video slides, narration, everything. and here's the beautiful part: all four of these pieces

01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:59,610
of content came from the same research, the same sources, the same knowledge base. so now you've got a research report, a

01:25:59,610 --> 01:26:06,730

01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:14,230

01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:20,510
trip planning, fitness routines, marketing strategies, whatever your niche is. the workflow is the same. you start with deep

01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:27,310
research, then you generate your slide deck, then your infographic, then your video. same sources, multiple formats, maximum

01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:34,190
reach. and you didn't need design skills. you didn't need video editing. you just needed notebook lm and good prompts. here's

01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:41,530
the bottom line: notebook lm went from being a simple summarization tool to a full content creation studio. slide decks, infographics,

01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:47,970
deep research, custom style video overviews, it's all there, and it's changing how we make content. if you're serious about

workflow yourself. upload a document, let notebook lm build you a slide deck, an infographic, video, all in under 10 minutes,

01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:07,450

01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:13,190
it online, you've got a traffic problem. that's where seo comes in. if you want more leads, more traffic, and more sales,

my team can help you rank higher on google check the link in the comments and description to order aico online and let us

01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:26,690
handle your backlinks while you focus on growing your business. google just rolled out two massive features to notebook lm

01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:34,770
infographics and slide, and they're powered by something called nano banana pro this. is google's gemini 3 image model built

01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:41,950
right into notebook lm what does this mean for you? you can now take any notes, any pdfs any documents you have, and turn

01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:48,890
them into professional visual content. we're talking charts, timelines, icons, full presentation slides, all generated automatically.

01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:55,870
no design skills needed, no expensive software. just upload your stuff and let the ai do the work. now before i show you exactly

01:27:55,870 --> 01:28:02,630
how this works, let me explain why this is such a big deal. most ai image generators just make random pretty pictures. they

01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:08,970
don't understand your content. they don't care about accuracy. but, nano, banana, pro. is different. it actually reads your

01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:14,990
sources. it understands your research. it creates visuals that match your specific content. so if you upload a report about

01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:22,430
sales data, it makes charts about sales data. if you upload notes about history, it creates relevant timelines. everything

01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:29,950
is based on what you actually uploaded. that's the game changer here. let me walk you through the infographics feature first.

01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:36,570
you go to notebook lm you upload your documents, notes, pdfs whatever you've got. then you click on the new infographics option.

01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:43,370
the ai reads through everything. it identifies the key points. it figures out what visuals would work best, and boom! you've

01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:50,310
got a professional infographic: charts showing your data, icons representing your concepts, timelines organizing your information,

01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:56,610
sleek layouts that actually look good. and here's the crazy part: you can customize everything. change the colors to match

01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:03,890
your brand, adjust the fonts, rearrange the layout, make it exactly what you need. then export it as a pdf or image. use it

01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:10,270
in reports, presentations, social media, whatever. the slide deck feature works the same way. upload your content, click the

01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:17,370
slide deck option. notebook lm generates an entire presentation for professional slides, clean design, your content organized

01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:24,710
perfectly. and just like the infographics, you can customize everything, then export to google slides or pdf ready to present

01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:30,430
immediately. i want to talk about something that's going to help you take this even further. if you want to learn how to scale

01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:27,570
lm now let me tell you who this is perfect for. students can turn study notes into visual study guides. educators can create

01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:34,150
lecture presentations in minutes instead of hours. content creators can make pitch decks in social media graphics without

01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:40,970
hiring designers. business professionals can turn reports into engaging presentations. anyone who needs to communicate information

01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:46,750
visually just got a massive upgrade. and remember, this is all free right now. you don't need notebook lm pro. you don't need

01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:53,290
to pay anything. just go to notebook lm google and start using it. let me give you some specific use cases so you can see

01:30:53,290 --> 01:31:00,070
how powerful this really is. say you're a student studying for exams. you've got pages and notes. upload them to notebook

01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:06,970
lm generate an infographic that summarizes everything visually. suddenly your study material is way easier to remember because

01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:12,370
our brains love visual information. or say you're a teacher preparing a lesson. you've got your lesson plan written out. upload

01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:21,010
it to notebook lm generate a slide deck. now you've got a full presentation ready to go with visuals that help students understand

01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:31,250
the concepts better. or maybe you're pitching a client. you've got graphics showing the market opportunity. generate slides

01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:37,430
for your pitch deck. now you look incredibly professional, and it took you maybe 20 minutes total. the productivity boost

01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:43,530
here is massive. things that used to take hours now take minutes, and the quality is actually good. this isn't some janky

01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:49,430
ai output that looks amateur. these are professional grade visuals. now here's something most people don't realize yet. you

01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:55,230
can combine this with other notebook lm features. remember notebook lm already does audio overviews. it can turn your notes

01:31:55,230 --> 01:32:01,290
into podcast style summaries. now you can do visual overviews too. so you could take the same source material and create an

01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:08,330
audio version for listening, a visual infographic for quick reference, and a slide deck for presenting. three different formats

01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:14,950
from one upload. that's insane efficiency, and it all stays synced because it's from the same sources. let me talk about nano

01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:21,190
banana pro for a second. this is what's powering everything behind the scenes. it's google's latest image generation model,

01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:28,810
part of the gemini 3 family. and what makes it special is how it handles source material. most ai image generators work like

01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:35,070
this: you give them a text prompt, they make an image based on that prompt, but they don't really understand context. they're

01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:41,970
just pattern matching. nano banana pro is different. it actually processes your documents, reads the text, understands the

01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:48,730
relationships between ideas, then generates images that accurately represent that information. so if your document talks about

01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:55,390
a process with five steps, it creates a visual showing those five steps in order. if you've got data comparing three different

01:32:55,390 --> 01:33:01,310
things, it makes a chart comparing those three things. the accuracy is what sets it apart, and that's why these visuals are

01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:07,150
actually useful instead of just decorative. now let me give you some tips for getting the best results. first organize your

01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:13,510
sources before uploading. the clearer your input, the better your output. if you upload a messy pile of random notes, you'll

01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:20,790
get messy visuals. but if you upload well-organized information, the ai has clear material to work with. they second use the

01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:27,070
customization options. don't just accept the first version the ai generates. adjust colors to match your brand. rearrange

01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:34,710
elements to emphasize what matters most. the ai gives you a great starting point, but you can make it perfect. third export

01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:41,830
in the right format for your use case. need to edit more later? export to google slides need a final version? to export to

01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:47,990
pdf need. something for social media? export as an image. pick the format that makes sense for what you're doing. fourth don't

01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:53,730
overthink it. just start creating. upload something and see what happens. the interface is super simple. you'll figure it

01:33:53,730 --> 01:34:00,790
out in five minutes, and because it's free, there's zero risk to experimenting. right let me talk about some advanced strategies.

01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:12,550
one thing you can do is create a content library. every time you research a topic, upload it. to now you've got a visual content

01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:18,890
library you can pull from anytime. need a quick social post? grab an infographic. need slides for a meeting? you've already

01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:25,650
got them ready. this is especially powerful if you work in a specific niche. build up your library over time, and you'll always

01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:33,470
have relevant visuals ready to go. another strategy is batch creation. set aside one hour per week. upload everything you've

01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:40,710
worked on that week. generate all your visuals at once. way more efficient than doing it one at a time as you need it. you

01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:48,130
can also use this for client work. if you're an agency or freelancer, this is a goldmine. clients love visual deliverables.

01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:54,670
use notebook lm to create professional looking reports and presentations. your clients think you spent hours on design work.

01:34:54,670 --> 01:35:01,270
reality is, you spent 10 minutes uploading their data and letting ai do the heavy lifting. that's how you scale without hiring

01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:08,210
a design team. one more thing about the integration with google's ecosystem. since this exports to google slides it plays

01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:14,410
nice with everything else you're probably already using. easy to collaborate with team members. easy to present in meetings.

01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:22,110
easy to share with clients. everything just works together. no weird file format issues. no compatibility problems. just smooth

01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:27,670
integration. now i know some of you are thinking, what's the catch? there's got to be limitations, right? honestly not many.

01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:34,190
the main thing is you need good source material. garbage in, garbage out. if you upload poorly written notes, the ai can't

01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:39,470
magically fix that. but if you give it decent content to work with, the results are excellent. the other thing is this is

01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:46,190
still new. google just rolled this out, so there might be some bugs or quirks as they work through things. but from what i've

01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:53,010
tested so far, it's pretty solid. way better than i expected for a free tool. here's what i think is coming next. right now,

01:35:53,010 --> 01:36:00,110
you can do infographics and slides. i bet google adds more formats soon. maybe social media graphics optimized for different

01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:06,710
platforms. maybe video thumbnails. maybe even short form video content. they're clearly investing heavily in making notebook

01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:13,690
lm a complete visual content creation tool, not just a note-taking app anymore. and with nano banana pro behind it, they've

01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:19,770
got the technology to do pretty much anything visual. so expect more features rolling out over the next few months. now before

01:36:19,770 --> 01:36:27,060
i wrap up, i want to hit one more time on why this. we're living in a world where visual content is everything. social media,

01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:34,800
presentations, reports, education, marketing, everything needs visuals. but creating good visuals used to require design skills

01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:41,700
or hiring designers. that barrier just disappeared. anyone can now create professional visual content. students competing

01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:48,360
with other students. creators competing with other creators. businesses competing with other businesses. if you're not using

01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:54,760
tools like this, you're falling behind because your is using them, and they're creating better content faster than you. that's

01:36:54,760 --> 01:37:00,540
just reality. so the question isn't whether to use these tools. the question is how fast can you learn them and implement

01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:06,580
them? and with notebook lm being this easy and this free, there's no excuse not to start today. all right, last thing before

01:37:06,580 --> 01:37:12,760
i go. if you're serious about staying ahead with ai tools and want to learn how to build real automation systems that scale

01:37:54,500 --> 01:38:00,700
for real business results. link is in the description below. trust me, if you're watching this video, you need to be in that

01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:09,340
community. notebook lm has just given you the ability to automate slides, infographics, and podcasts from anything in like

01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:16,980
under 60 seconds. so i'm gonna show you exactly how this works, how to use notebook lm and how to create these crazy infographics

01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:25,020
like you can see right here. plus how to create these absolutely insane presentations in one single click. you can see here

01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:33,020
we've got a full designed presentation step by step, and i literally just automated it before this live stream in one click.

01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:39,380
it was ridiculous. now if you've never used this before, i'm going to talk you through how notebook lm works. so don't worry.

01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:45,800
just dropped. it's free. it's brand new. and when i saw what it could do, i pretty much had to go live immediately because

01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:52,280
if you're a business owner who creates any kind of content, presentations, guides, trainings, client materials, this is about

01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:58,800
to save you hours every single week. and the other thing about this is you don't need any design skills. you don't need to

01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,320
use canva you don't need any powerpoint you don't need to hire anyone. you just upload yourself, click a button, and it gives

01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:11,020
you a finished slide deck with infographics, charts, and professional designs. or an infographic that explains your process

01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:18,640
in one image. or a podcast where two ai hosts can discuss your content like it's a real radio show. or from your existing

01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:24,020
documents, sources, youtube videos, whatever you want to plug in. it's all completely free. now here's why it matters for

01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:30,100
you specifically. okay if you've ever felt overwhelmed by all the ai tools out there, if you've tried stuff before and it

01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:35,920
didn't work, if you don't have time to learn complicated tech, this is different. it's simple. it works. i'm going to show

01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,820
you exactly how to use it step by step, so stay until the end because i'm also going to give you my prompts, my workflows,

01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:48,820
and some custom automations you can copy inside the video notes. let's get straight into it. okay so what you can see here,

01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:55,860
this is notebook lm you can get free access at notebooklm.google.com. and to make it as simple as possible, all you do is

01:39:55,860 --> 01:40:01,500
you go to create a new notebook like you can see right here. and then you can upload sources. so for example, you can copy

01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:06,840
and paste tags. you can add a link. you can add a website, google drive doc. you can have multiple different sources. in fact,

01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:15,220
you can actually add 300 different sources, which is pretty wild. so what i'm going to show you exactly today is a step-by-step

01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:22,760
guide for the process described in this video as psx has requested. all right, so if you want to get access to this, you can

01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:28,800
get it at notebook lm and then for example, we can grab a video from a youtube channel or any source you want to paste in.

01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:35,720
let's take something brand new, like for example called opus 4 5 which you know most of the internet doesn't have much information

01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:42,020
on yet because it literally just came out 24 hours ago. we can paste in a youtube source like so, and that's going to load

01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:49,480
up a new notebook right now. inside that notebook, we are custom training it on our information and our sources. okay you

01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:55,600
see that example right here? we've got the source loaded on the left-hand side. then we have this custom gpt and then if we

01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:02,160
want, i mean, it's basically a notebook. and then inside here, we can just click this and this, and literally in one click,

01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:08,580
what we are generating is an audio view, a video view, some flash cards, a quiz, an infographic, and a slide deck all in one

01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:14,620
single click. all right, and you can automate all of those literally instantly just by loading in the source and then quickly

01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:19,160
creating these. now you might be wondering, okay, what's the quality of these? what do they look like? here's one i actually

01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:25,980
created earlier. so if we go back to notebook lm here, we can go over to building applications with google's new ai stack.

01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:33,380
you can see i've loaded in some information and sources about google's ai stack over here. and then if we click on this example,

01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:42,000
as you can see, what you can see here is a custom infographic, very detailed. and the difference here, you may not notice

01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:49,420
this, but the difference here is that you've never been able to create an infographic as detailed as this, as well designed

01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:55,520
as this, with perfect text. look at the icon, for example. you got smashed up laptop there with the excuse these tools probably

01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:01,980
don't work well. we've talked about the old limiting beliefs versus the new limiting beliefs that help you build stuff and

01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:09,220
automate stuff with ai right? and so you can see how quick and easy it is now to generate these custom built infographics

01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:16,080
as well as video views, podcasts, and everything else. and you can do this for free. it's absolutely mind-blowing. so if you've

01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:21,420
never done this before, definitely check it out. now i'm going to show you some other cool stuff that you can do and also

01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:26,980
have a look at the outputs from opus so you can see we've already got a quiz ready, already got the flashcards ready, and

01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:32,960
we are just going to have to wait a couple of minutes for the rest of this to be automated and built. and this is the thing,

01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,820
if you've not realized this already, right now notebook 11 google's technology in general, i would say it's a total level

01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:46,520
above everyone else's because if you were using ai a few years ago, you know that google was way behind everyone else. whereas

01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:52,300
now, what they're creating is something that is pretty much changing the internet, right? and changing the way that we learn,

01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:59,780
changing the way that we create content is absolutely mind-blowing. now if you want to know, okay, what are all the new key

01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:05,440
features? because i know a lot of you are using notebook lm already. you already understand it. you're already like, okay,

01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:11,280
what's actually new in november 2025? so let me talk you through that. these notes are inside the air profit boardroom. so

01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:17,060
if you want to go and grab that, you can just go to the air profit boardroom in the link in the comments description. go to

01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:23,760
the classroom or just go to airprofitboarding com and then. from here, what you're going to do is go to sop updates, as you

01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:29,920
can see. and then we've got november 2025. this gets updated every day. so you've got 25th there with opus we've got 23, 22,

01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:36,960
etc. right and if you scroll down, you can see we've got the key notes and features here. so one of the biggest new updates,

01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:44,000
and this is due to nano banana, which is a brand new image update from notebook. and you can see that we can now turn documents

01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,500
into visual infographics powered by nano banana. what do they look like? they look like this. how do you automate them? you

01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:56,220
just go up here. so you load in your source inside notebook lm and then you are going to click infographic over here, and

01:43:56,220 --> 01:44:01,900
this generates an infographic for you. all right, now if you want to see what the infographic looks like, so i literally just

01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:08,220
clicked generate, as you saw a couple of minutes ago. then you can see that right here inside this section, right? and see

01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:15,600
for ai showdown, claude opus versus gemini 3 pro, the comparison based on initial hands-on testing, the powerful record opus

01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:21,700
and a top competitor. and then you can see the head-to-head verdict with this infographic. it is mind-blowing. now you can

01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:27,700
share that. you can download that. you can go full screen on it, and you can use this on social media, for example. so for

01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:35,200
example, we wanted to use this. what we could do is just download that image over here. then we can go over to whatever social

01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:42,020
media platform you prefer. so i'm just going to do this x for example. then we're going to upload the image of the infographic

01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:56,300
we just created, and we can say claude opus 4 5. versus versus gemini 3 pro. who wins? here's my take and plus our success

01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:03,660
right. and you can see that we can easily create not just the infographic itself in one click. but we can also generate social

01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:08,840
media content that we could post on linkedin on facebook and in any sort of platform where you're trying to reach a lot of

01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:15,260
people, right? and if you have questions as we go along, this is live, so feel free to ask, and i will be happy to help you.

01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:20,520
all right, so we go back to this infographic as well. you can zoom in, you zoom out, but you can actually read the text. you

01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:29,160
can see the text is pretty much perfect, right? so this is using nano banana pro which is the new update from google and it's

01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:34,700
integrated inside notebook lm so all you do is you click a button. boom shakalaka! you've got an infographic ready to go.

01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:40,000
i just love the design of this. i love the way it's laid out. i actually think it's better than most designers. it's better

01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:46,100
than most infographics i've paper in the past, and you can just automate it in one click. all right, that's just one single

01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:52,160
update from notebook lm in november 2025. let's have a look at the rest of the stuff. all right, so we also got slide deck.

01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:58,560
so we can create comprehensive and complete presentations from our sources, customized to our source in one single click.

01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:05,640
how do we do that? so if we go back here, we'll go back inside notebook lm we're gonna x off that and then scroll down, and

01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:10,520
you can see this is generating the slide deck. so i'm going to go to a previous one i've generated. it does take a bit longer

01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:16,040
to create a slide deck because they have so much detail inside them. and you can see i've generated a few different ones over

01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:21,560
here. so each time this generates, this should be unique as well. so for example, here we've got build your business with

01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:27,560
google's new ai slide. that's actually an infographic. we've actually got a presentation over here. i'm going to go full screen

01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:33,760
on that. we can actually start and play the slideshow as well. and you can see here that based on my video that i generated

01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:40,320
and loaded into notebook lm it's taken the whole transcript and then created a beautiful presentation about it, right? so

01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:46,180
you can see here it says, google just dropped gemini and it's changing everything. here's the google ai building stack: how

01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:51,760
to build apps, automate work, and create infinite minutes." and then it's got a quote from the actual transcript, right? so

01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:58,080
you can see it's quoted, this is the craziest ai release i've ever seen," which is something that she used inside the presentation,

01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:03,900
right? then we've got the presentation, as you can see right here. again it's using nana banana and all the custom notes from

01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:11,700
the transcript. and we again automated that in one single click. even took some sort of screenshot from the video and then

01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:18,660
plugged that in, right? and it's actually got a link as well inside that video, right? so you can see here it's super detailed.

01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,860
it's even got the office stack from the video as well, and it's absolutely mind-blowing what this can generate and how quick

01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:30,260
and easy it is to generate this stuff. all right, now if you want to do that, all you do is you go back to notebook lm go

01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:36,280
to that custom automation that you've plugged in the sources to, and then you're just going to go over here and you're going

01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:42,120
to click slide deck, right? you just click side deck. now you can actually edit the slide deck before you start creating content

01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:48,500
with it. so you can see, for example, you can select detailed or you can select to present slides. so this is clean visual

01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:53,920
slides. this is something more comprehensive. you can select between short and default. you can choose your language. you

01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:59,640
can actually create in multiple languages, as you can see. and then you can actually describe what you want to include inside

01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:06,200
the slide deck if you want to customize it more before you actually publish it. so easy to do this stuff, and it's never been

01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:11,320
easier. and this is better than most humans can do, right? and this is the thing that i'm finding with most of these tools

01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:16,480
that are coming out now, especially the new releases, right? so i think the ai has really stepped up over the last couple

01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:21,420
of weeks. if you look at the latest releases from google i've got tons of videos and training inside. they are profitable

01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:26,380
to run that. but if you look at the latest updates, they are mind-blowing. they're doing things that are better than humans

01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:32,120
at this point, right? and it's the same with notebook lm it can create better presentations. it can create better infographics

01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:41,080
for most human designers, and it's absolutely mind-blowing what it can do. now again, that's only two updates that came from

01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:46,600
notebook collect so we've got deep research, we've got custom personas, we've got audio overviews, we've got flashcards, video

01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:52,900
views, and this is free, right? there are capacity limits in terms of how many you can create based on the demand, but basically

01:48:52,900 --> 01:49:00,180
that's what you can do and how you can use it, right? and again, these presentations are absolutely amazing, right? you can

01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:04,920
click on them, you can view them, you can switch around, you can actually download them, play them, go full screen, etc.,

01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:10,980
right? and you can load that onto whatever platform you want to use. you can probably adapt it to instagram carousel, whatever

01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:18,020
you want to use, right? the thing is, right, i have an seo agency, and this is absolutely mind-blowing with this new technology

01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:23,600
that's coming out because i would have done things so different if notebook lm had these features when i was building my seo

01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:29,840
business. picture this, right? it's 3am i'm staring at my wall of research tabs. my eyes hurt, my brain is fried. i need to

01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:37,300
turn 47 different sub p's and seo guides into a training for my team. and back in the day, i would have spent like six to

01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:42,240
eight hours just reading everything, and then another four hours making notes, and then another three hours turning those

01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:49,420
notes into slides, and then another two hours actually making it look good, right? it's almost 20 hours for one single training.

01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:57,480
that was the old way. now imagine if you could dump all 47 guides into one place, aka notebook lm click a button, and get

01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:02,720
a full slide deck that looks like a designer just made it, ready to present in minutes. that's basically what notebook lm

01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:08,460
has just dropped for free. and here's where it gets wild. okay let's say you're building content for a client. well you have

01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:13,440
their brand guidelines that you can plug into notebook you have their old blog posts, you have their competitive research,

01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:18,900
you have their keyword data, and the old way was that you would read everything, you would take notes, you try to remember

01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:25,200
what goes where, miss stuff, go back, read again, make a dot, format it, hope it makes sense, right? the new way with notebook

01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:31,980
lm is literally all you do is you plug in a source over here, you get your custom notebook lm over here, and you can actually

01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:37,400
ask your questions inside here and create a mind map or whatever. and then you just create your presentation or your infographic,

01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:44,960
as you can see, right? how easy is this stuff? it's absolutely mind-blowing how powerful this is and how easy it is to do.

01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,500
okay and i don't think most people are aware of, especially business owners, because they're too busy running their business.

01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:57,000
so again, the new way is that you upload everything, ask notebook lm to make an infographic or a presentation or a video showing

01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,500
the content strategy, and it's done. you ask it to make a slide deck for a client meeting, done. on a podcast-style breakdown

01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:07,580
where you can listen to this stuff whilst driving or whatever, it's done, right? and i remember sitting in my home office,

01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:13,220
frustrated, tired, thinking there has to be a better way to process all this information. i was building automations, i was

01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:21,320
building tools, but the gap between raw research and something i can actually use was still huge. and today that gap just

01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:27,660
closed. this week i've uploaded my notes from like 12 different videos about ai trends. i've uploaded three pdf reports. i've

01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:32,600
uploaded my own google docs about what i've learned. and then i've asked notebook lm to make me a slide deck about the top

01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:39,400
five ai tools solopreneurs should learn in 2025. and it gives me the slides back: beautiful design, charts in the graphics,

01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:45,320
key points pulled from everything i uploaded, and i didn't write a single slide, right? this is a mind-blowing thing. i didn't

01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:51,420
design anything. i just uploaded my research, clicked a button, and now think about what that means for someone starting out

01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:57,440
or a solopreneur running a business, right? you don't need designers. you don't need to spend hours formatting. you don't

01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:04,020
need to struggle with making your research actually useful. you just need to know how to ask the right questions and then

01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:09,420
how to feed it the right sources. and you can see how easy that is. you know what sources you want to feed it, okay? and that's

01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:14,200
exactly what i teach inside the airprof water it's not just like the basic stuff that everybody already knows. these are the

01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:19,660
frameworks to think it, the way to combine tools like this into systems that actually automate and run parts of your business.

01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:25,880
because here's the truth: this tool is free. anyone can use it. but most people upload one pdf and give up, okay? and the

01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:31,140
people who win today are the ones who understand the bigger picture, right? who know how to stack these tools together, have

01:52:31,140 --> 01:52:36,120
a community showing them what's working right now. and that's why today i want to show you exactly how this works step by

01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:43,260
step so you can see what's possible when you know how to use what's already available to you. so we're going to talk about

01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:50,200
the goldie source to asset framework, and this is basically my approach to turning messy research into polished business assets

01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:57,000
without design skills or spending hours formatting, right? and the framework has five steps: source, stack, shape, style,

01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:04,060
and share. so let's talk about source. so for example, what we can do here is we can start finding relevant sources. so i'm

01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:10,240
going to go to create a notebook. again this is available on notebook lm and from here, we can start uploading our sources.

01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:16,320
at this point, source means gathering everything related to your topic that you want to create around, right? pdfs, google,

01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:22,420
docs, youtube. links, website urls blog posts, even images, whiteboards, or handwritten notes. notebook can read it. most

01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:27,840
people upload one or two things and wonder why the output is weak. the secret is volume and quality. more sources and better

01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:35,580
sources equals better output. so let me talk you through exactly how to do this step by step. and tisha says, can you direct

01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:40,820
the style of the infographic? let's have a look at that in a second. all right, so what i'm going to do first is we are going

01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:46,300
to upload these sources. this is step one of the five-step framework that i'm teaching today, right? so where do you get the

01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:56,460
sources from? let's say for i want to do a new post on the latest ai news. i can grab videos from my youtube channel, as you

01:53:56,460 --> 01:54:01,660
can see. so we're going to grab this one, and let's go over to notebook lm and we will load that in. i'm going to just paste

01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:08,220
i in. boom there we go. all right, now we're going to add another source. and the thing here to note is, let's say for example,

01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:17,580
you wanted to research the web, right? you can actually just put, okay, ai news november 2025 here, right? like that. so you

01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:23,720
could add and research the web here, plug in the fast research, etc. and then that's pretty simple and easy to do, all right?

01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:31,500
or you can go to add sources here, paste in some more text, add some youtube etc., right? so let's say for example, i want

01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:38,560
to grab more information about the latest tools this week, right? what i can do is i can open up this one. all right, so we're

01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:44,080
going to go to youtube here. we're going to open up this video on copilot ai we'll go back to notebook lm we're going to add

01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:51,500
another source right here. all right, there we go. and then we're going to add another one. so we're going to just keep going

01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:58,620
and add a bunch of sources. again the more and the better quality your sources are, the better the outputs from this particular

01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:05,300
process. all right, so we're going to take this training. it's a very in-depth training. it's a one-hour mega course on the

01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:12,240
new updates from gemini 3, which just came out. and we're going to go inside here, and we shall add another source, my friend,

01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:17,800
right? that we're going to plug in youtube there we go. and it's just loading up these sources. and once it's done, it's going

01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:22,860
to have a tick box next to it, right? so it's loaded in three sources that are custom trained for this particular notebook

01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:29,480
right here. now we could add many more sources. i'm on a live stream, so obviously i'm just going to keep it short. but we

01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:36,360
could add 300 sources if we wanted to, if we wanted to create like an insane amount of volume of sources. and again, you could

01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:41,960
add more if you don't want to load this manually, and you can search across web or even your content from google drive if

01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:49,460
you just wanted to automate this, right? super simple and easy to do. so that is the sourcing step of the five-step framework.

01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:55,000
and again, we've got a five-step framework, and it starts with source, and it's going to be stack, shape, style, and share.

01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:02,580
all right, so we've covered sources. now let's talk about stack. okay so you want to organize your sources by project or outcome,

01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:08,030
and you want to create separate notebooks for different purposes. so let me show you how that works. so if we go back to the

01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:14,350
home here inside notebook lm you can see all of these different notebooks i've created. so for example, claude opus building

01:56:14,350 --> 01:56:21,050
applications. with google's new ai stack. my sales recipe uploaded as a source, and create a custom notebook right here. google

01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:27,070
antigravity my book, seo link building mastery. right? you can actually see the dates, and you can organize your sources.

01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:32,890
you can actually delete them, or you can edit the title to create a more organized, right? so for example, here we can say,

01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:43,330
okay, edit the title, and let's call this the November, AI, news November. 2025. all right, so we've got a notebook that's

01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:51,650
organized here based on the latest updates. okay so that is the stack process. so again, you can create different notebooks

01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:57,370
for different purposes. so one for client presentations, one for your own training materials, one for content ideas, and just

01:56:57,370 --> 01:57:05,330
keep them separate so that ai stays focused on what matters for your specific goal. and that is stage number two. okay now

01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:10,630
stage number three, and i'm blasting through this because i want to make sure that you get the most value possible in the

01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:17,630
shortest amount of time here, is shape. so that is stage number three. this means choosing the right output format for your

01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:23,430
goal. so notebook lm now gives you multiple options. so if we go over here, you can see, for example, we can select between

01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:29,050
audio overview, video for you, mind map, reports, flashcards, quiz, infographic, slide deck, right? we can also add notes

01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:35,270
down here, and we can edit the outputs before we publish them. in terms of shaping, slide decks will be for presentations,

01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:41,150
infographics will be for visual summaries, audio overviews for podcast-style breakdowns, flashcards for learning, and then

01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:48,710
quizzes for testing and understanding. each format serves a different purpose, right? so for example, here we can go into

01:57:48,710 --> 01:57:56,270
the infographic section, right? and we can select between our different languages. we could have portrait or square, depending

01:57:56,270 --> 01:58:02,270
on what orientation we want, or landscape. we could choose level of detail, so you go with concise, standard, or detailed,

01:58:02,270 --> 01:58:07,930
right? and then inside the describe the infographic you want to create, you can talk about what you want to talk, right? so

01:58:07,930 --> 01:58:16,470
for example, here we can say, okay, talk about the use cases of chloride opus 4 5. which is the new update that literally

01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:21,710
just came out 24 hours ago, right? so you can do with some really cutting-edge stuff because you're loading in your custom

01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:28,030
sources, and because you're loading in custom from youtube you can take videos that are brand new with very in-depth training,

01:58:28,030 --> 01:58:34,090
right? and let's be honest, you can find almost anything on youtube about the topic you want to learn, right? so for example,

01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:41,250
michelle says, it's incredible what notebook lm does, and i would 100% agree with you, michelle that's a great point, right?

01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:48,590
we've covered three stages so far: sourcing, stacking, shaping, right? and this is a custom framework. this is the goldie

01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:55,810
source asset framework now. step number four: style means customizing the output to match your brand and audience. so you

01:58:55,810 --> 01:59:01,790
can now set like custom personas, or you can tell it exactly how you want to write and create. so let me show you how that

01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:09,710
works, right? so for example, let's say we wanted to create a video over here. we can choose between explainer or brief, right?

01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:16,110
so we could go with brief and really just simplify that video overview. we can go with the language is english we can choose

01:59:16,110 --> 01:59:22,750
between visual styles, right? so we can select something that's designed based on the style that we want, right? so let's

01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:29,550
say for example, i can load in classic up here, and then we can tell it exactly what we want the ai host to focus on inside

01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:36,190
the video overview, and we can shape it exactly how we want it. so let me show you how that works. we can say, okay, then

01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:45,730
show the benefits of joining the ai profit boardroom community with an offer stack at the end, and you could shape it exactly

01:59:45,730 --> 01:59:56,670
how you want. we or you can say, okay, then give a custom offer on how you can learn ai automation and save time using the

01:59:56,670 --> 02:00:05,540
ai profit boardroom community. okay and you can say, okay then transition naturally and give a custom offer. right we can

02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:11,760
then click generate, and we're shaping that video overview exactly how we want it, based on the custom sources and the guides

02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:17,280
we're giving, and the custom instructions we're giving to notebook ellen right and that is stage number four, which is style.

02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:23,720
okay now once you've done that, then you're going to come on to the fifth and the final stage, which is sharing. right sharing

02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:29,020
means actually using and sharing what you create. so there's no point creating this stuff if you're not going to use it. right

02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:34,520
it's all fun in games playing with tools, but if you're a business owner and you're a solopreneur, and you're trying to grow

02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:40,320
your business and trying to automate and save time, then you've actually got to use this stuff. right so for example, like

02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,900
a lot of my videos are ai avatar videos on youtube and the reason that i do that is because i want to showcase the power of

02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:54,000
ai right the same, for example, if we have a look at this page, i actually redesigned this whole page yesterday, which is

02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:03,060
a for our seo agency. and actually redesigned this whole page using cord opus 4 5. yesterday. so my main point here is don't

02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:09,540
just play with these tools, actually use them, actually create them. right diamond says i get this question every single live

02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:16,500
stream, which is this a real goldie or avatar? this is a real goldie unfortunately we're not at the point yet where ai avatars

02:01:16,500 --> 02:01:22,160
could do live streams yet, but i'm sure that's coming one day, along with zoom calls and sales calls and else. all right,

02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:31,680
but my main point here is like this beautiful page was created using claude opus right and how did we do it? we just asked

02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:36,920
opus to redesign the page, create html plug it into to go high level if you want more training on that, join the air profit

02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:43,500
boardroom basically. that's how it goes. right diamond says legend, love the content, big fan, appreciate you. thanks so much,

02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:49,780
diamond that's super kind, appreciate you. all right, so you can see how this works. and yeah, you can export slide decks

02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:54,840
as pdf so you can download the audio over use and embed that into a blog post. you can share the infographics on social media

02:01:54,840 --> 02:02:01,700
like i did a minute. all right, so if we go back to x right now, then i'm talking about using this stuff practically. and

02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:09,740
for example, we've got the example here, and diamond has actually replied to this. all right, so you can see here we've taken

02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:16,720
the infographic from notebook ln plug that onto x we could use the same on linkedin or whatever platform we want to create

02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:23,780
content around and then share that. and that's literally in the space of what, 20 minutes? that's got 147 views. all right,

02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:30,300
we've reached 147 new people. you know about our stuff, know about me because i've created that content and automated it with

02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:35,500
notebook right this stuff is crazy powerful if you know how to use it. you can reach a lot of people if you know how to use

02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:40,960
it, and that's what i'm showing you today in an actual practical way. right you might have been thinking, and i want to break

02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:46,640
down, okay, what's stopping you right now? okay so you might be thinking this sounds too good to be true, but let me address

02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:52,760
pretty much every doubt you have about notebook or these ai tools in general. okay so number one, some people want to say

02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:58,660
i'm not technical enough for this, but notebook lm is made for people who aren't technical. you upload files, you click buttons,

02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:04,320
you get results. right there's no code, there's no complicated setup. if you can use google drive or if you can click buttons,

02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:10,820
you can do this. right and if you can't click buttons, and you can hire a virtual assistant to click buttons for you. michelle

02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:16,160
says i joined, looking forward to more. thanks so much, michelle i really appreciate you. thanks so much for joining the aircraft

02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:22,680
recording and that is awesome. welcome on board. all right, so yeah, i can actually see you just joined now. that's awesome,

02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:28,320
thanks so much. you know, other people want to say i tried my ai tools before, and they gave me garbage. all right, so if

02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:34,920
we have a look at claude opus and the infographic that we just automated whilst i was on the live stream with you, so i'm

02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:39,660
not even concentrating fully. i'm just talking to you and guiding you through the process, and you can see how easy it is

02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:44,740
to create a beautiful infographic that, again, we could share. and you can see here, like the text is pretty much perfect,

02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:50,400
the copyright is super nice. it looks better than most human designers can make. it looks better than anything i could create.

02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:56,420
right we just did it in one click. some people are going to say i tried ai tools before, and they gave me garbage, but that's

02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:03,820
because most ai tools pull from the entire internet and make things up. right whereas notebook lm only uses what you give

02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:10,720
it. it can't hallucinate facts because it only knows what's in your sources, and every answer comes with citations you can

02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:16,520
check. right so for example, if we go back here, we escape off there, and then we start typing here, and we say, okay, let's

02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:22,320
take one of these auto-suggest questions. so it says, how does claude opus compare functionally and economically to its top

02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:28,300
competitors like gemini pro and it'll actually analyze and examine these sources that were plugged in, and then it gives the

02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:33,660
sources for each answer. right so you can see it's used the sources that we've given it. right so the only time this would

02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:39,920
mess up is if we give it bad sources, which is why we need to make sure that we load in good sources into this. right michelle

02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:45,680
says they turned out quite nice. 100, they're looking really nice. it's looking really good. all right, some people are going

02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:52,060
to say i don't have time to learn another tool, but this tool actually saves you time. the learning curve is maybe 10 minutes,

02:04:52,060 --> 02:04:57,640
and you've pretty much been through the learning curve with me today. so you know the time savings hours per week, and you

02:04:57,640 --> 02:05:03,280
can generate a full presentation just by clicking a button. you go off, make some coffee, and you come back, and it's ready

02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:11,700
to go. also some people say free tools always have a catch, and the thing is with notebook lm or with gemini with nano banana

02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:18,340
pro with ai studio etc., the catch is that google wants you in their ecosystem. that's it. all right, the core features are

02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:24,200
actually free. i think you get up to something like 100 notebooks, 50 sources per notebook, three audio overviews per day,

02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:30,320
and that's more than enough. most people watching this, i would say for 99, i've never created more than three audio reviews

02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:37,100
in one. i've never created more than 50 sources per notebook. right so this is more than enough for most people. and other

02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:42,640
people say my business is different, this won't work for me, but this works for any business that deals with information.

02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:48,360
coaches you need to create training materials. consultants who need client presentations. content creatives, you need to research

02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:54,220
topics. freelancers you need to organize project notes. if you read or write anything, this is probably going to help you.

02:05:54,440 --> 02:06:01,380
okay and so this is what i'm talking about here. and then if we have a look, we've got the video overview. so i'm actually

02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:07,500
going to mute this because i don't think the sound will be that good, but it does come with these examples, and this is what

02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:15,020
it's all about. all right, now our legends. hi julian i'm standing at the chow fryer. my first day in bangkok welcome to bangkok

02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:20,280
just out of the gym, i'm watching a live stream. what a great synergy. that's what we're talking about. what sort of a legend

02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:27,320
goes to the gym at what, 6:50 a.m., and then comes out and watch a video and learns about ai like you're absolutely smashing

02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:33,120
it. that's a great way to start the game. so good for you, man. if you, i would read out your name, but it says out on the

02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:39,440
name, but it's good to see here, and welcome to bangkok good on you for getting yourself out there. michelle says omg i have

02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:44,620
a creator. i love his trainings. he gives us transcripts with the replay and a problem all into notebook to keep track and

02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:49,760
quick reference. that is what we're talking about. so there's some great ways to use this stuff. right it's really exciting,

02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:56,820
and honestly, i think it's never been such a great time to learn, but also to be running a business. if you're running a business,

02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:03,400
if you're in a business, what a time. right like you don't need a team, you don't need a big squad of people to manage. you

02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:09,540
just create stuff like this, and you've got a whole marketing team in one click using ai and you can automate a lot of this

02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:14,680
as well. other people, when i say i don't have anything to upload, but i would just start with whatever you have. right so

02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:21,880
for example, michelle uses the transcripts from a creator that she really likes. right and that's a perfect way to use it.

02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:27,240
you could plug in past client calls, you could plug in your own notes, articles, you say competitive websites, youtube videos

02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:33,680
in your niche. you have way more sources than you think. anything you consume, you can pretty much plug into this. here and

02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:40,120
story box maker says can we share to folks about a google account? the link is not totally public in my opinion. as far as

02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:45,700
i know, i think you do need to log in with google account. again this is why it's free. right they want more people inside

02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:52,080
the ecosystem, and one of the ways to do that is by making sure people log in. by the way, if anyone's watching this and you

02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:57,160
want to share this stuff, so you can click on share in the top right over here, and then you can share your notebook. and

02:07:57,160 --> 02:08:03,920
then you can actually add a welcome note here. you can add people's emails, you can choose between full notebook, chat only,

02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,520
and you can make this restricted or give anyone with link access. and then you just copy the link, hit save once you make

02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:16,440
the changes. boom shakalaka, you can share this with the world. right so it's crazy powerful, super easy to use, doesn't take

02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:25,020
a long time, and you can see how this works step by step. right so let's keep going through the official. davey b says hey

02:08:25,020 --> 02:08:31,060
everyone, good to see you. so let's have a look at this video that we're going to play back now. so this is a video. it does

02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:38,560
come with a narrated voiceover at the top. you can download that as well. so if we download that, we can download over here,

02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:45,200
and i'm just going to go full screen with this. and also we can play the video. let's see what it's like. right now, i have

02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:52,400
muted the sound because i don't think it'll sound very good on the replay, but you can see that it's it's created a quote

02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:59,140
from the particular transcript, designed the whole presentation, added a narration, made it downloadable. it's just playing

02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:06,820
it back automatically. it's clean, it's nicely designed, and it's created using the directions we gave it. it's even great

02:09:06,820 --> 02:09:14,480
some nice charts, as you can see in terms of the test scores. it talks about what makes opus 4 5 so different, and then you've

02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:18,980
got the old way and the new way, which is something that i always like to look at. it's okay, what were people doing previously,

02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:24,520
and what are they doing now? and it's taking that information from the transcripts that i plugged in and then started to use

02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:31,560
that. so you can see how easy and powerful this is and how quick it is to make it. so as that's playing, let me talk you through

02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:36,440
some other stuff. some people want to say the outputs won't be good enough for clients. i would argue that these outputs are

02:09:36,440 --> 02:09:41,540
starting points. you can customize everything. you can choose format, set the tone, add your own polish. this tool does 80%

02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:48,020
of the work, and then you just add the 20%. how do you do that? you give it the alternative, so you give it the custom instructions.

02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:55,540
michelle says this is a great alternative to gamma i would agree with you. and some people say i can't afford to pay for tools,

02:09:55,540 --> 02:10:01,600
but this is free for the core features. it's free. there is a premium pricing that you can sign up to on notebook alembic

02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:07,740
you can just use the free stuff and then see what you think. now other people say i'm overwhelmed by all the tools out there.

02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:14,060
julian you talk about a new tool every single day, and that's true, to be fair. like we talk about opus and then copilot and

02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:20,180
then gemini and then red plate and then genspark and this is all within the last 24 hours pretty much. right what i would

02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:25,920
say here is that's exactly why you need one place that teaches you what actually matters. so for example, inside the air,

02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:30,340
profit, board, and. we just cut free the noise. we show you what's working right now. we help you build systems, not just

02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:38,440
random tools. some people, some wild people might say what if google shuts down and then we lose access to this tool? google

02:10:38,440 --> 02:10:44,920
has been building notebook alembic since 2023. they just added it to google workspace for businesses. they released mobile

02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:51,320
apps this year for notebook alemb they're investing more, not less, and i think this tool is becoming part and core of how

02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:58,160
google thinks about ai productivity. and then some people say i'm already doing okay without ai but okay is the enemy of great.

02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:04,040
okay your competitors are learning these tools. the ones who don't use them and learn them will fall behind. the question

02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:09,800
isn't whether ai will change how business works, is whether you'll be ahead of that change or just playing catch up. okay

02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:17,100
that was the video generated. as you can see, pretty simple and easy to do, and you can download this stuff. you can customize

02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:24,180
it. you can create many different notebooks. we've got the chatbot as well inside here. what's pretty cool about this, this

02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:30,000
is great for training your team. so if your team has questions and you're getting a little bit bored of explaining the same

02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,760
thing over and over again, but at the same time, maybe your sap and your step-by-step instructions are too long as a playbook.

02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:42,220
for example, like our sales sap it's 70 pages. if that's the case, if your playbook is too big, then they can actually just

02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:47,260
go inside something like this. it's custom trained on our playbook, as you see on the left, and then they can start typing

02:11:47,260 --> 02:11:53,000
and asking questions. that's great because now it saves you time, and you don't have to train people over and over again,

02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:59,940
which, as we all know, can be quite monotonous. all right, this stuff is really simple and easy to use. and again, you might

02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:05,640
be saying this content, maybe it's ai where it's not that useful, people don't like it. but you can see here, for example,

02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:12,660
this infographic that we just posted and automated on the live stream today, it's already got 200 views. all right, so it's

02:12:12,660 --> 02:12:18,860
already reached 200 new people. all right, now if you reach 200 new people every single day, would that help you reach more

02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:24,520
customers? 100. right now, imagine if you 10x out if you got a virtual system to help you with that. right wouldn't it be

02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:30,960
powerful? 100. and that's what we're talking about here. now what i want to do is i want to show you a 30-day plan in terms

02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:37,520
of how you can implement this step-by-step into your business. right because really what i want you to do is just take this

02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:42,560
stuff and learn it and actually implement it. there's no point just watching the video about it. take action so that you can

02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:49,160
see the transformative effects. all right, so what to do from day 1 to 30, and this is all inside the notes of the ai profit

02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:55,440
boarding so. again, you just go into the air profit boarding comes with an amazing community of 1,700 people just like me,

02:12:55,440 --> 02:13:01,740
interested in ai sharing their latest information. you can also get a calendar of coaching calls. all right, and if you want

02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:08,000
to start using this stuff, what you can do is you can just jump on the coaching course here, jump on the live calls, ask any

02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:16,020
questions you have, etc. super simple and easy to do. so if we go back to that 30-day plan, what you're going to do is just

02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:23,440
go to the air profit boardroom go to classroom then you're going to scroll down, and you would go to the sap update section,

02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:32,420
as you can see. and then inside this, you can see the link to the, okay, are these actually brand new updates? so you can

02:13:32,420 --> 02:13:39,500
see here, for example, this was just announced literally like a couple of days ago, this new slide decks feature. and what's

02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:44,480
interesting about this, they've said with slide decks, is less about making slides, more about telling stories. so this is

02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:51,800
the official notebook lm website, sorry, account on x and you can add sources to the storybook, deep research, simplified

02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:59,260
slides, remove the messy notes, and basically take all your messy notes and turn it into something amazing, like you can see.

02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:07,380
all right, so let's talk about this 30-day plan that we're talking about here. all right, so i would just go to notebooklm.google.com,

02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:14,000
assign them with your account, and create your first notebook. right just test out, upload three to five sources related to

02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,840
something you're working on right now. generate an audio. if you listen to it, this just gives you an immediate sense of what's

02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:25,500
possible. all right, so in terms of a 30-day plan to get results with this stuff, that's what i would do. day one to day three,

02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:31,260
in terms of day four to seven, i would build your first business notebook. all right, so pick one recurring task in your business.

02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:37,060
maybe it's creating content, maybe it's client onboarding, maybe it's research, and create a dedicated notebook for it. okay

02:14:37,060 --> 02:14:42,980
upload everything related to that task, and that could be old documents, reference materials, examples you like, and generate

02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:49,780
a slide deck or infographic from it. and just see how much time this saves compared to you doing it manually. all right, so

02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:59,480
for example, here, let's say, for example, i want to create a new presentation for my team based on a sales page we've created recently about seo right

02:15:06,540 --> 04:14:59,640
SEO. Right could do here. i'm hoping this works. if not, i've got a backup idea. and if it doesn't work, then that's okay

04:14:59,640 --> 04:15:05,579
as well. so what we're going to do is we're going to grab this page, which is our new black friday deal for seo agency. check

04:15:05,579 --> 04:15:11,739
it out if you want. it's available at juliangoldie.com if you're interested in ranking on google and llms and so what we're

04:15:11,739 --> 04:15:17,039
going to do is we're going to take that url then we're going to go back to notebook.lm. like you can see, we are going to

04:15:17,039 --> 04:15:22,479
plug in the websites. we'll just paste in the over here. and then we're going to use that as training data so that we can

04:15:22,479 --> 04:15:30,179
create a custom notebook lm based on the information. as you can see, right? so we've got this notebook lm this is custom

04:15:30,179 --> 04:15:36,959
trained. now there's a few different ways that my team could use this, okay, to save me time from training them. so what else?

04:15:36,959 --> 04:15:42,259
what could we do here? number one, we could create a slide deck. and inside the slide deck, we could say, okay create a sales

04:15:42,259 --> 04:15:53,859
presentation, the client-facing course that sells the new seo packages we have, plus the black friday deal we have on right

04:15:53,859 --> 04:16:00,599
now." okay we'll hit generate, and then that's going to create a custom presentation based on the black friday deal that we

04:16:00,599 --> 04:16:07,799
have for seo at the same time, what we can also do is, let's say, for example, i'm training a new sales rep. he's got questions

04:16:07,799 --> 04:16:18,179
about how this works. i can share this tool with them. and then i can go inside here, and i can say, okay give me a, uh, or

04:16:18,179 --> 04:16:26,379
tell me the 80/20 this deal, plus what it includes," right? and what that's going to do is dig through the details of the

04:16:26,379 --> 04:16:32,639
source we loaded in, which is a web page, right? so this sales page we literally just copied and pasted in. and then we're

04:16:32,639 --> 04:16:39,619
going to go back to this tab, and you can see here that we've got all the details for the 80/20 of this seo package that we're

04:16:39,619 --> 04:16:47,439
selling for our agency, right? and so, now we're waiting for the slide deck to generate. we can use that to present back to

04:16:47,439 --> 04:16:53,639
our clients once it's done. we can change the style of it. we could even create a video overview, and with the video view,

04:16:53,639 --> 04:16:58,819
we could send that to clients, right? and then they can watch that video breakdown of the sales page. or we could take that

04:16:58,819 --> 04:17:05,339
video overview, upload it, and then embed it inside the page and plug it in right here. okay that's another example of how

04:17:05,339 --> 04:17:11,959
we do. now taro says, cheers welcome to help." and story box maker. says, if you try it tomorrow, it will be even better."

04:17:11,959 --> 04:17:17,319
yeah here is, uh, everything seems to get better, especially notebook 11. like when i was testing this out a year ago, it

04:17:17,319 --> 04:17:23,059
was already mind-blowing, but now it's even better. so notebook 11 is crazy powerful, and this stuff just gets better pretty

04:17:23,059 --> 04:17:29,439
much every single day. but i think the best time to start using it is now because the thing is, if you wait, then your competitors

04:17:29,439 --> 04:17:34,219
are going to start using it. they're going to start learning it. and if you understand how to use it now, then you've got

04:17:34,219 --> 04:17:39,539
a much better shot of getting better results. whereas if you wait, like, you're going to fall behind. people going to start

04:17:39,539 --> 04:17:47,179
using this without you, etc. okay so we're waiting for that slide deck to generate, but let's come back to the 30-day plan.

04:17:47,179 --> 04:17:53,719
so we've talked about days 4 to 7, which is building your first business notebook. and then days 8 to 14, you want to really

04:17:53,719 --> 04:17:59,859
start mastering custom personas. all right, this is where most people plateau. so inside notebook LM you can just go into

04:17:59,859 --> 04:18:04,699
your settings, create a custom persona. tell notebook LM exactly how you want it to respond, what time to use, what level

04:18:04,699 --> 04:18:10,559
of detail, what format you prefer. test it with different prompts. refine until it matches your style. so how do you do that?

04:18:10,559 --> 04:18:16,579
for example, here you can go to the settings, and you can add, like, custom. here you can just add a custom example of how

04:18:16,579 --> 04:18:25,579
you want it to reply, right? so for example, here, if you wanted, you could actually give this tool to your audience. train

04:18:25,579 --> 04:18:31,399
it on whenever you want to teach your audience. and then inside the responses, you could say, okay every time respond to links

04:18:31,399 --> 04:18:41,259
to my funnels," right? so let me show an example. up so people ask questions. every time, answer it, plus transition into

04:18:41,259 --> 04:18:49,079
pitching booking a call here. all right, what it's going to do is it's going to pitch our funnel links every time someone

04:18:49,079 --> 04:18:54,979
uses it. so it's kind of like a sales tool that works without us having to do anything. so for example, here, now we can ask

04:18:54,979 --> 04:19:01,479
a question. okay what happens if rank one is missing?" and then you can see it's answered the question based on the custom

04:19:01,479 --> 04:19:08,179
source, which is great. but we were talking about those custom personas that we're using, right? so for example, here, you

04:19:08,179 --> 04:19:15,259
can say, if you're ready to implement this powerful A20 SEO framework with a guarantee, the absolute best next step is to

04:19:15,259 --> 04:19:21,299
book a strategy call right now. this will allow us to discuss your specific goals and how we can secure those page one rankings

04:19:21,299 --> 04:19:28,179
for you." and boom, it's got a link to our funnels. all right, and then if we click, it's linked to our funnels right here.

04:19:28,179 --> 04:19:35,159
beautiful right? so now it's a sales tool that's working for us, and we can share it to our audience. so pretty amazing. you

04:19:35,159 --> 04:19:41,479
can upload this live on youtube to watch it later. so i actually have done that. if you go to youtube on my live streams here,

04:19:41,479 --> 04:19:49,859
let me show this tab. so if you go to live, you can watch back my recordings here. you can see here each day i do like a one

04:19:49,859 --> 04:19:57,639
to two-hour training on AI. we do one pretty much every single day, and you can watch them back on youtube there. all right,

04:19:57,639 --> 04:20:05,999
so it's pretty simple and easy to do this stuff. if we go back to the 30-day plan, we've talked about day 1 to 3, which is

04:20:05,999 --> 04:20:14,419
set up first and win. all right, day 4 to 7, build your first business notebook. day 8 to 14, master custom personas. all

04:20:14,419 --> 04:20:20,939
right, day 15 to 21, you want to build your own content system. okay so create a notebook for your content ideas, and you

04:20:20,939 --> 04:20:26,139
can upload articles you want to reference. you could upload transcripts, your own videos. you could upload notes from your

04:20:26,139 --> 04:20:31,039
brainstorm. so just use this as a content brain. and then when you need ideas as well, you could ask the notebook. and when

04:20:31,039 --> 04:20:36,159
you need to create something, just generate it from your existing sources. so you can see how quick and easy it is to start

04:20:36,159 --> 04:20:43,319
building your own custom content system. days 22 to 28, you can start creating client-ready assets. you can use what you've

04:20:43,319 --> 04:20:47,999
learned to create something you can actually use with customers or clients. that could be a presentation, guide, a training

04:20:47,999 --> 04:20:53,919
video outline, an infographic explaining your product process, or something that adds value and looks professional without

04:20:53,919 --> 04:21:00,159
hours of design work. and again, that's pretty simple and easy using notebook. and then the final day, i told you this was

04:21:00,159 --> 04:21:07,759
a 30-day plan to make sure you can actually implement it into your business. the final step is you can start documenting what

04:21:07,759 --> 04:21:13,599
works for you. so you can create templates you can reuse. share your wins inside the alprofitboarding community. get feedback.

04:21:13,599 --> 04:21:19,259
help others who are starting up. this is basically how you solidify your learning. become part of a community that keeps you

04:21:19,259 --> 04:21:25,879
sharp, right? as an example of that, we go back to the alprofitboarding here. we click on wins. you can see all of these different

04:21:25,879 --> 04:21:33,539
wins right here that people are sharing right here. so for example, like steve steve just shared a youtube api that uploads

04:21:33,539 --> 04:21:38,819
from computer directly to youtube right? pretty crazy. and then he shared how he's done it, and he's actually shared a pdf

04:21:38,819 --> 04:21:44,699
right there. pretty crazy. you can see here, for example, we're sharing what we're grateful for. we actually got 50 ways to

04:21:44,699 --> 04:21:51,939
be grateful. and i think that's one of the best things about this community is, yes, we like ai but at the same time, let's

04:21:51,939 --> 04:21:57,059
enjoy the journey. let's learn together. let's grow together. let's create something amazing, right? it's not about me. it's

04:21:57,059 --> 04:22:03,559
about community and how we can share and learn and grow. also you can see here justin sharing his heygen avatar and how he

04:22:03,559 --> 04:22:09,819
made his digital twin based on the tutorials we share inside the alprofitboarding so you really want to just become part of

04:22:09,819 --> 04:22:15,939
that community and just share your wins and systemize, right? the way that i would recommend you really grow is just by finding

04:22:15,939 --> 04:22:21,279
people who are doing the same things as you or some people who are doing better things than you. and then, in terms of prompts,

04:22:21,279 --> 04:22:29,439
you can see a bunch of prompts you can use right here. and yeah, that's basically how it if we go back to notebooklmp here,

04:22:29,439 --> 04:22:35,499
we've still got the slide deck being built out, and we'll come on to that in a second. but yeah, it's just, it's absolutely

04:22:35,499 --> 04:22:42,679
amazing what you can do, what's possible, how powerful this is. and this is a free tool that's just perfect for people learning

04:22:42,679 --> 04:22:48,519
about this stuff, people growing with this stuff, right? and that's what the game is about, my friends. now if you're ready

04:22:48,519 --> 04:22:57,479
to start using this notebooklmp if we go back to here, now we've got the presentation. so let's play that back. so you can

04:22:57,479 --> 04:23:03,319
see here it's created that sales presentation. if we pull this up, there we go. so this presentation created with notebooklmp

04:23:03,319 --> 04:23:08,779
based on that page we just loaded. we've got the details of the black friday deal, right? and the cool thing about this is

04:23:08,779 --> 04:23:15,559
my team could easily just use this as a sales presentation. now you probably want to customize it with your own branding,

04:23:15,559 --> 04:23:21,179
which you can do inside notebooklmp as well. but you can see how powerful this is, right? and then it's even created like

04:23:21,179 --> 04:23:29,219
the icons. everything's really nicely presented. it's really easy to use. it's got the problem and the solution, right? so

04:23:29,219 --> 04:23:34,539
here's the problem. people waste time on audits. here's our fix. we deliver what matters: content published, links built,

04:23:34,539 --> 04:23:41,799
rankings tracked, etc. you can see here, for example, it talks about seo mess, which is a very common problem, right? we built

04:23:41,799 --> 04:23:47,799
the system to fix it, which the aico engine. here's what you get inside the package. here's a simple step-by-step process.

04:23:47,799 --> 04:23:54,079
and this is all accurate because it's based on our sources. and then the black friday deal, what you get, etc., right? and

04:23:54,079 --> 04:23:59,559
this is all generated using notebooklmp using that simple automation that i've shared with you today. and then we can download

04:23:59,559 --> 04:24:06,579
that, or we could just share the link and give clients access to it directly. so for example, here we could actually switch

04:24:06,579 --> 04:24:14,439
to anyone with link, hit save, and then if we click on the share button, copy link slides, we're gonna open that up in a new

04:24:14,439 --> 04:24:23,139
tab. here we go, link to the slides over here, right? pretty nice, pretty nice. that is notebooklmp and exactly what you get

04:24:23,139 --> 04:24:28,799
right here. and the thing that i would say here is you've seen exactly how notebooklmp works. you've seen how to turn messy

04:24:28,799 --> 04:24:34,119
research into slide decks, infographics, and audio content in minutes instead of hours. but here's the things this is just

04:24:34,119 --> 04:24:39,939
one single tool, one single update, one piece of the puzzle, okay? every single week and pretty much every single day now,

04:24:39,939 --> 04:24:45,579
there's something new, whether that's a new tool, a new update, new ways to automate what used to take forever. the question

04:24:45,579 --> 04:24:50,599
is, how do you keep up, right? how do you know what's worth learning and what's a waste of time? how do you turn all these

04:24:50,599 --> 04:24:57,979
tools into actual systems that run your business? and that's exactly why i built the AI profit boardroom right? if you haven't

04:24:57,979 --> 04:25:04,679
seen the AI profit boardroom here it is. this is our community. this is everything that you get. you get a community, classroom,

04:25:04,679 --> 04:25:12,059
calendar, etc. the main thing to note here, right, is that i put this together because i used to be drowning in. every week,

04:25:12,059 --> 04:25:17,219
i'd spend hours figuring out if it was useful. most of the time, it actually wasn't. i wasted months on things that didn't

04:25:17,219 --> 04:25:22,899
move the needle. so i've started documenting what actually works: the frameworks, the automations, the combinations of tools

04:25:22,899 --> 04:25:29,239
that have saved me time. so for example, here you see all these different trainings and courses. if you've never used AI before,

04:25:29,239 --> 04:25:35,319
you don't know where to start, you can get that inside this six-week automation classroom right here. you can also see we

04:25:35,319 --> 04:25:42,699
have a playbook on all our best automations for shorts, avatar videos, etc. we even have, for example, all my latest trainings

04:25:42,699 --> 04:25:48,679
from november 2025, where i just keep you updated with the frameworks that are working right now. and basically, how it works,

04:25:48,679 --> 04:25:56,299
and thing to note here is like we update this every single day, the latest stuff. i started sharing this stuff first with

04:25:56,299 --> 04:26:01,719
a few people, then more, and now we have a community of business owners basically helping each other figure this out together.

04:26:01,719 --> 04:26:08,119
and everything i've learned, every shortcut, every system is all right now. here's what you get when you join the AI Profit

04:26:08,119 --> 04:26:13,819
Boarding today. number one, you get the AI avatar engine. it looks something like this, right? so you go to the playbook,

04:26:13,819 --> 04:26:21,959
and you can see inside here we have our AI avatar video process. and basically, this is how to duplicate yourself without

04:26:21,959 --> 04:26:28,539
hiring anyone. you get automated AI systems that create content, handle delivery, and clone your best processes. i've spent

04:26:28,539 --> 04:26:35,139
months building and testing this. i spent thousands of, but the value of having a virtual team that works around the clock

04:26:35,139 --> 04:26:42,859
or an AI avatar that publishes youtube videos for you all day, that's worth so much in terms of save time. you also get unlimited

04:26:42,859 --> 04:26:48,259
custom automation requests. so normally, if you wanted someone to build a custom AI workflow, you'd spend a lot, right? but

04:26:48,259 --> 04:26:53,419
inside the boardroom, you can request custom automations built specifically for your business. if you need a workflow that

04:26:53,419 --> 04:26:59,679
connects your tools or a simple custom gpt you can do that, right? so let me show an example. that if you go to this thread

04:26:59,679 --> 04:27:07,219
inside the AI Profit Boarding, here you can see that we've got this free custom gpts request. inside the AI Profit Boarding,

04:27:07,219 --> 04:27:12,739
you can post what you want, and then we create it. so chris requested the lead magnet custom gpt and then we're like, here

04:27:12,739 --> 04:27:18,659
you go," his video notes. and then i create a custom video showing how it works, plus the automation itself. i don't know

04:27:18,659 --> 04:27:23,679
any other community that's actually doing that right now. the other thing that i would say here is you get daily live access

04:27:23,679 --> 04:27:30,359
to me. so every single day, i go live. you can hop on. you can ask questions. you get coached in real time. you also get the

04:27:30,359 --> 04:27:37,679
coaching inside the AI Profit Boarding as well. so if we go back into the calendar section here, you can jump up the live

04:27:37,679 --> 04:27:44,599
streams here and just ask any questions you have live on the course, okay? you get unstuck immediately because instead of

04:27:44,599 --> 04:27:49,459
spending hours googling we just help you directly on that call. you don't have to wait for email replies, and i'm guessing

04:27:49,459 --> 04:27:55,819
you just get direct help when you need it. you also get the fast track implementation kit. so this is a copy and paste system

04:27:55,819 --> 04:28:01,399
so you can start implementing it immediately, right? this is for people who want momentum right away. so there's no theory,

04:28:01,399 --> 04:28:08,059
no someday plans, just actual implementation you can do within 24 hours to join it. so let me show an example. if you go to

04:28:08,059 --> 04:28:15,279
the six-week AI automation master class here, you can learn how to build your own AI agent in under five minutes, right? pretty

04:28:15,279 --> 04:28:21,519
crazy. and that's inside the AI Profit Boarding. just go to the classroom and then go to start here as well. and then you

04:28:21,519 --> 04:28:27,499
also get the black vault, which is my back-end system. so these are the exact automations behind major client work and deals,

04:28:27,499 --> 04:28:34,019
right? so i'm opening this up for people who join during this window during black friday and this alone took me months to

04:28:34,019 --> 04:28:40,279
refine. so for example, here, if you go to classroom and then you go down here to the agency mastermind section, you learn

04:28:40,279 --> 04:28:45,339
how to land clients, how to grow your agency. if you want to do more client work, if you're a freelancer, if you're a coach,

04:28:45,339 --> 04:28:51,879
etc., and you need clients, go right here. it shows you how to do sales leads, how to generate content that actually attracts

04:28:51,879 --> 04:28:59,779
people into your business, etc. right so you can sign up now during black friday just click the link below this video or go

04:28:59,779 --> 04:29:05,019
to the AI Profit Boarding.com. you can choose between monthly or annual, and you get all the video notes from today as well.

04:29:05,019 --> 04:29:11,439
so if you go to the classroom, you get all the video notes for today, plus previous calls, just to get the coaching call recordings,

04:29:11,439 --> 04:29:18,779
the Q&A call recording bowl as well. if you go to the SP updates, you can see this is updated with new video tutorials and

04:29:18,779 --> 04:29:23,999
step-by-step processes, as you can see right here. and if you want to indicate how to get the latest stuff, you just go to

04:29:23,999 --> 04:29:31,459
the date, right? so november 25th, november 26th, etc. i would just constantly add in new information and new helpful tutorials

04:29:31,459 --> 04:29:38,399
inside the AI Profit Boarding.com to help you. all right, muller says this one is pretty AI. i'm pretty sure this is actually

04:29:38,399 --> 04:29:44,679
me, but i appreciate that. i must be quite smooth in presenting, so thank you very. i'll say that as a compliment. but yeah,

04:29:44,679 --> 04:29:49,759
so you can see exactly how this works. if you haven't joined the AI Profit Boarding already, make sure you do join. we've

04:29:49,759 --> 04:29:52,859
got a 35% off deal right now for black friday

02:30:06,320 --> 04:45:00,300
Black Friday. so make sure you sign up. you can lock in your lifetime discount if you sign up right now. and yeah, no book

04:45:00,300 --> 04:45:08,500
limit is absolutely amazing. and just to recap on what we've done today, all right? so if you go back to here, in terms of

04:45:08,500 --> 04:45:13,580
what we've done, we've talked through all the new features. so infographics, slide decks, deep research, custom personas,

04:45:13,580 --> 04:45:19,380
audio reviews, flashcards and quizzes, video reviews, and how it's free for new users, right? so you can get access to this

04:45:19,380 --> 04:45:25,280
stuff. and also, i've talked about my best prompts. and i've shown you the five-step process to the Goldy Sourced Asset Framework,

04:45:25,280 --> 04:45:32,140
which is basically sourcing, stacking, shaping, styling, and sharing. we've also talked about some limiting beliefs and how

04:45:32,140 --> 04:45:37,500
to avoid them holding you back, so you can keep growing your business. and finally we've talked about the 30-day plan, so

04:45:37,500 --> 04:45:43,020
you can start winning now and implement this for your business, right? and Mullo says, is it just me or has AI got to the

04:45:43,020 --> 04:45:47,559
point where it's improving by the second? i would agree with that. i think it's getting better and better. and i think the

04:45:47,559 --> 04:45:53,059
slower you are to implement this stuff into your business, the more you fall behind, right? that's basically it.

04:45:53,059 --> 04:45:59,019
Mullo says anticipating grok 5 in q1 january of this year. hopefully it's better than 4.1 because i was pretty disappointed

04:45:59,019 --> 04:46:07,339
with that. but yeah, that's basically it, my friends. all right, google just gave notebook lm superpowers. you can now upload

04:46:07,339 --> 04:46:14,679
photos of your handwritten notes, textbook pages, even screenshots, and it reads them like they're typed documents. no more

04:46:14,679 --> 04:46:21,179
retyping anything ever again. this is huge, and i'm about to prove it to you live. all right, so here's what just happened.

04:46:21,179 --> 04:46:27,959
google rolled out a massive update to notebook lm and it's not just a small tweak. this thing now accepts images as sources:

04:46:27,959 --> 04:46:35,559
photos of handwritten notes, textbook pages with diagrams, screenshots of graphs, whiteboards from your office meetings, all

04:46:35,559 --> 04:46:43,820
of it. you drag it in, and notebook lm reads it. it runs something called ocr which means optical character recognition. that's

04:46:43,820 --> 04:46:49,780
just a fancy way of saying it looks at your photo and extracts all the text and meaning from it. that you can ask it questions

04:46:49,780 --> 04:46:55,219
about what's in the image, like you're talking to someone who just read your notes for you. let me show you why this matters.

04:46:55,219 --> 04:47:01,839
you know how you take a photo of notes in class or at a meeting, or you screenshot something important from a website? most

04:47:01,839 --> 04:47:08,659
people never look at those photos again. they just sit in your camera roll, collecting digital dust. now you can upload those

04:47:08,659 --> 04:47:14,999
into notebook lm and actually use them. you can ask questions like, what were the three main points from this meeting? or

04:47:14,999 --> 04:47:22,179
explain this graph to me in simple terms. and notebook lm will answer based on what it sees in your image. it's like having

04:47:22,179 --> 04:47:29,199
a research assistant who never sleeps and never complains. but here's where it gets even better. notebook lm also added something

04:47:29,199 --> 04:47:36,839
called deep research and discover. these tools can automatically find web sources for you, so you're not just limited to what

04:47:36,839 --> 04:47:44,100
you upload. you can tell notebook lm to go find additional information on a topic, and it will pull articles, studies, and

04:47:44,100 --> 04:47:51,619
data from across the web. then it combines everything: your uploads and the web sources into one big research notebook, all

04:47:51,619 --> 04:47:58,600
in one place. no more juggling 10 browser tabs and three different note apps. now let me walk you through exactly how this

04:47:58,600 --> 04:48:05,920
works. first you open notebook lm you create a new notebook. then you drag in your images. let's say you have a photo of handwritten

04:48:05,920 --> 04:48:12,500
notes from a lecture. you drop it into the sources panel. notebook lm processes it for a few seconds. then boom, it shows

04:48:12,500 --> 04:48:18,180
up as a source you can reference. now you go to the chat and ask a question, something like summarize the key points from

04:48:18,180 --> 04:48:25,520
my handwritten notes. notebook lm reads the image, extracts the text, and gives you a clean summary. now okay, this is cool,

04:48:25,520 --> 04:48:32,800
but how do i take this to the next level and actually scale my business with ai i want to tell you about the ai profit boardroom

04:48:32,800 --> 04:48:40,059
this. is the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with ai automation. inside

04:48:40,059 --> 04:48:47,039
you'll find a community of entrepreneurs and business owners who are using ai to grow faster and work smarter. we share case

04:48:47,039 --> 04:48:53,579
studies, tools, workflows, and strategies that actually work. if you're serious about using ai to build your business, you

04:48:53,579 --> 04:48:59,239
need to be in there. i'll drop the link in the description. check it out. all right, back to notebook lm but it doesn't stop

04:48:59,239 --> 04:49:05,579
there. you can ask follow-up questions like, what did i write about marketing strategies? or which section talked about customer

04:49:05,579 --> 04:49:13,000
retention? and it pulls the exact info from your photo. let me give you a real example. say you photographed a textbook page

04:49:13,000 --> 04:49:20,300
with a complex diagram. you upload it, then you ask, explain this diagram in simple terms. notebook lm looks at the image,

04:49:20,300 --> 04:49:27,059
understands the visual layout, reads any labels or text, and explains it back to you like you hired a tutor who can see what

04:49:27,059 --> 04:49:34,280
you're looking at. or imagine you screenshot a graph from a research report. you upload it and ask, what's the shown in this

04:49:34,280 --> 04:49:40,980
graph? notebook lm analyzes the data points, the axis, the legend, and tells you what the graph is saying. no manual data

04:49:40,980 --> 04:49:48,540
entry, no squinting at tiny text, just instant analysis. now here's the part that makes this a total game changer. you can

04:49:48,540 --> 04:49:55,320
mix image uploads with other source types: pdfs, google docs, google sheets. even urls all in the same notebook. so you could

04:49:55,320 --> 04:50:03,059
have a photo of your meeting notes, a pdf of a research paper, a google sheet with your data, and a few web articles. notebook

04:50:03,059 --> 04:50:09,180
lm treats them all as sources and can answer questions that pull from any of them. it's like building your own personal knowledge

04:50:09,180 --> 04:50:15,940
base. and the new discover and deep research tools make it even more powerful. let's say you're researching a topic, but you

04:50:15,940 --> 04:50:22,940
don't have all the sources yet. you can tell notebook lm to use deep research. it goes out and finds relevant articles, studies,

04:50:22,940 --> 04:50:30,580
and data for you. then it adds those as sources to your notebook automatically. you don't have to hunt down links or copy-paste

04:50:30,580 --> 04:50:37,640
urls notebook lm does the heavy lifting. then you can ask questions that combine everything: your uploads and the web sources

04:50:37,640 --> 04:50:44,360
it found. it's like having a research team working for you around the clock. but i need to be real with you about the limitations

04:50:44,360 --> 04:50:53,700
because no tool is perfect. and if you don't know the weak spots, you're going to get burned. first ocr is good, but magic

04:50:53,700 --> 04:51:02,620
if your handwriting is messy. the accuracy drops. if your photo is blurry or the lighting is bad, is going to miss stuff.

04:51:02,620 --> 04:51:10,840
so always double-check what it extracted. compare the image side by side with what notebook lm says it found. don't just trust

04:51:10,840 --> 04:51:19,760
it blindly. second there are upload limits. you can't just dump a thousand images into one notebook. google has caps on the

04:51:19,760 --> 04:51:26,500
number of sources and the file sizes. so if you're working on a massive project, you might need multiple notebooks. third

04:51:26,500 --> 04:51:33,580
some features are still english only, like the audio overview feature where notebook lm generates a spoken summary. if your

04:51:33,580 --> 04:51:39,780
content is in another language, that feature won't work yet. now let's talk about privacy. this is important. when you upload

04:51:39,780 --> 04:51:47,220
an image, notebook lm processes it in the cloud. the that means google sees it. if you're uploading sensitive information

04:51:47,220 --> 04:51:53,380
like medical records or confidential business documents, you need to be careful. you might want to redact names, account numbers,

04:51:53,380 --> 04:52:00,480
or anything private before you upload, or just avoid uploading it until notebook lm offers local processing options. right

04:52:00,480 --> 04:52:06,180
now, everything goes through google servers, so treat it the way you treat any cloud service. if you wouldn't put it in google

04:52:06,180 --> 04:52:12,120
drive don't put it in notebook lm all right, so how do you get the best results with this image feature? here are my tips.

04:52:12,120 --> 04:52:19,480
number one, take clean photos. shoot straight on, not at an angle. make sure the lighting is bright and even, no shadows across

04:52:19,480 --> 04:52:27,420
the page. the cleaner your image, the better the ocr number two, use high resolution. don't upload a tiny compressed screenshot.

04:52:27,420 --> 04:52:35,420
if you can, use the original photo or a high-quality scan. more pixels means better text recognition. number three, test it

04:52:35,420 --> 04:52:42,000
first. upload a sample image and see what notebook lm extracts. if it's missing words or getting things wrong, retake the

04:52:42,000 --> 04:52:48,660
photo with better conditions. number four, verify the output. always check the original image against what notebook lm says,

04:52:48,660 --> 04:52:55,260
especially for numbers, dates, or critical facts. ocr can misread similar-looking characters like an eight and a capital b

04:52:55,260 --> 04:53:01,700
or a zero and the letter o if you're using this for something important, you have to verify. now here's something cool you

04:53:01,700 --> 04:53:12,640
can do with this. you can build a personal research library. every time you read a book, take photos of the you print out

04:53:12,640 --> 04:53:18,080
notes from meetings, whiteboard sessions, anything. over time, you'll have this massive searchable database of everything

04:53:18,080 --> 04:53:24,980
you've learned. and you can ask notebook lm to pull ideas from across all your sources, like show me everything i've learned

04:53:24,980 --> 04:53:32,180
about email marketing from all my sources, or what are the common themes in my meeting notes from the last three months. it's

04:53:32,180 --> 04:53:38,900
like giving yourself a photographic memory, but better because you can search and analyze it. another use case: students can

04:53:38,900 --> 04:53:45,800
photograph their class notes and textbooks, then use notebook lm to quiz themselves or generate study guides. instead of rereading

04:53:45,800 --> 04:53:52,620
100 pages, you ask questions and get targeted answers. freelancers and consultants can use it to organize client research.

04:53:52,620 --> 04:54:00,500
upload notes from discovery calls, screenshots of competitor websites, pdfs of industry reports, then ask notebook lm to find

04:54:00,500 --> 04:54:07,060
patterns or create summaries for your client presentations. content creators can it to gather research for videos, articles,

04:54:07,060 --> 04:54:15,020
or courses. take photos of books, upload pdfs add web sources, and let notebook lm help you outline your content. the possibilities

04:54:15,020 --> 04:54:22,120
are kind of endless. but here's the thing: this tool is only as good as the sources you give it. if you upload garbage, you

04:54:22,120 --> 04:54:28,600
get garbage out. so be intentional about what you add and always fact-check. notebook lm can summarize and cite, but it can

04:54:28,600 --> 04:54:35,380
also get things wrong, especially if the source itself is wrong or if the ocr misreads something. so use it as a starting

04:54:35,380 --> 04:54:41,340
point, not the final answer. now let me hit you with one more feature that ties this all together. the discover tool doesn't

04:54:41,340 --> 04:54:47,160
just find random articles. it actually tries to find sources that are relevant to the question you're asking or the topic

04:54:47,160 --> 04:54:53,340
you're researching. so if you're writing a paper on climate change and you've uploaded some notes, you can tell notebook lm

04:54:53,340 --> 04:55:00,960
to discover more sources. it will go find scientific studies, news articles, and expert opinions. then it adds them to your

04:55:00,960 --> 04:55:06,800
notebook, and you can ask questions that pull from all of them. it's like having a librarian who knows exactly what you need

04:55:06,800 --> 04:55:13,780
before you even ask. and because everything is in one notebook, you're not switching between apps or losing track of where

04:55:13,780 --> 04:55:19,740
you found something. all your sources are right there. you can see them in the sources panel. you can click on any source

04:55:19,740 --> 04:55:26,140
to read the full text or view the original image. and when notebook lm. gives you an answer, it cites which source it pulled

04:55:26,140 --> 04:55:32,240
from, so you can trace every claim back to the original. that's huge for credibility, especially if you're doing research

04:55:32,240 --> 04:55:38,980
for work or school. use it to build a personal research library, create study materials, organize client work, or gather content

04:55:38,980 --> 04:55:45,340
research. start small, be consistent, and let the tool do the heavy lifting. that's everything you need to know. now go try

04:55:45,340 --> 04:55:51,760
upload an image, ask a question, see what notebook lm can do. and here's what i want you to do: drop a comment below and tell

04:55:51,760 --> 04:55:58,540
me what kind of image you're going to test first. handwritten notes, a textbook page, screenshot? i want to know. julian goldie

04:55:58,540 --> 04:56:05,460
reads every comment, so make sure you comment below. today we're going to be running through the latest updates from notebook

04:56:05,460 --> 04:56:13,900
lm so, notebook lm have. released three new big updates today. one of them is the deep research update. this literally just

04:56:13,900 --> 04:56:19,440
been announced a few hours ago, as you can see. and they've said rolling out now, deep research browses hundreds of sites

04:56:19,440 --> 04:56:26,460
to craft an organized report and give you an annotated list of sources for deeper exploration, all of which you can add directly

04:56:26,460 --> 04:56:33,040
to your notebook. so that is update number one. we also have update number two, where they've said finally the moment you've

04:56:33,040 --> 04:56:37,480
been waiting for, rolling out today, you can now create your own custom video overview styles by tapping the prompt in the

04:56:37,480 --> 04:56:44,400
customization box. drop your favorite examples, blah blah blah. we also have another update which says chat history is rolling

04:56:44,400 --> 04:56:51,180
out now, so you can actually close the resume it later without losing your conversation, which is another new update on notebook

04:56:51,180 --> 04:56:58,740
lm now if you've never used notebook lm before, it's a really powerful and free tool that you can use to generate outputs

04:56:58,740 --> 04:57:07,160
like you can see right here, right? and you can use this to generate like videos, podcasts. you can create some really powerful

04:57:07,160 --> 04:57:12,920
tools, kind of like custom trained on whatever you want, essentially. and i'm going to show you exactly how to use this. all

04:57:12,920 --> 04:57:19,480
right, so if we go to create new, we're going to test out the deep research mode first. we can use deep research mode here

04:57:19,480 --> 04:57:26,360
inside notebook lm so let's have a look here, and we'll test this out. so you can see we've got this try deep research for

04:57:26,360 --> 04:57:31,520
an in-depth report on new sources, and you've got an option between deep research and fast research, right? so fast research

04:57:31,520 --> 04:57:38,220
was the old option where you could pretty much just quickly get answers and search and that sort of thing. now deep research

04:57:38,220 --> 04:57:44,240
is where you can get more in-depth reports, and then you can use those to create audio or to create videos or to create mind

04:57:44,240 --> 04:57:51,760
maps or reports or flashcards or quizzes, right? so we can go over here, and we shall say, okay, research do deep research

04:57:51,760 --> 04:57:59,220
and the latest ai updates this week, right? just as an example, you can change this prompt to whatever you want, but we're

04:57:59,220 --> 04:58:06,380
going to just use that as a basic example for exploring degrees. nicolas says it's the essential ai tool. it is indeed, my

04:58:06,380 --> 04:58:13,040
friends. i think out of everything that i've tested, honestly, like, um, is miles ahead of 99% of the stuff i've tested. i've

04:58:13,040 --> 04:58:18,640
put like thousands of hours into this, right? so if you've never tried notebook lm before, definitely check it out. whilst

04:58:18,640 --> 04:58:23,519
we're waiting for the deep research mode to run, i'm going to open up a new tab, and i'll show you some of the other examples

04:58:23,519 --> 04:58:28,760
that we do. for example, here we have the deep research running, and then if we this tab instead, you can see some examples

04:58:28,760 --> 04:58:34,439
of what i created previously. for example, here we've loaded up a bunch of sources into our content, and then we can use this

04:58:34,439 --> 04:58:40,519
kind of custom train tool to answer any questions that we have. but also, we can automate audio overviews, video views, mind

04:58:40,519 --> 04:58:48,539
maps, etc. so it's really easy to use, quite simple. and the next option that we have is the custom video overview styles,

04:58:48,539 --> 04:58:54,799
right? so if we go to video overview here, and then we click on edit based on the sources that we have on the left-hand side,

04:58:54,799 --> 04:59:00,439
we can start using this for video views, right? so we choose our language, like you can see you can get all sorts of languages

04:59:00,439 --> 04:59:05,920
down here on the left-hand side. and then you can choose what sort of visual style you want. now you can actually click on

04:59:05,920 --> 04:59:12,640
custom here, and you can type what the visual style is that you want for your particular presentation. so if we open this

04:59:12,640 --> 04:59:18,640
up, you've got, for example, whiteboard style, anime, or heritage, or watercolor, or paper craft, or retro print, right? all

04:59:18,640 --> 04:59:23,680
these. and now, you can, so if you've got a certain style in mind, or even like a certain artist that you want to use for

04:59:23,680 --> 04:59:30,280
this, you can use it inside notebook lm like you can see just by going to the video overview and then describing what you

04:59:30,280 --> 04:59:36,640
want as a prompt. so we'll try that in a second here. you could also, for example, try 8-bit pixelated, and then you can see

04:59:36,640 --> 04:59:43,760
like this really interesting video view style, pop art, hyper-realistic, and super cute or super weird, like surreal. so let's

04:59:43,760 --> 04:59:48,500
go over here. we'll try this out. so i'm going to say, okay, super weird style. in fact, you know what? i'm going to take

04:59:48,500 --> 04:59:54,750
a screenshot here, and then we go over to chat gpt and i'm pasting that screenshot, and i'll say, okay. come up with some

04:59:54,750 --> 05:00:03,769
ideas of notebook llm styles, visual styles for a video i'll create. and that should give me some ideas personalized to me

05:00:03,769 --> 05:00:09,149
that i can use to start creating these videos. nicolas says, oh that's a nice addition to have video styles. just wish it

05:00:09,149 --> 05:00:14,789
would do british english rather than american english voices." hopefully that's coming out soon. i know they've just released

05:00:14,789 --> 05:00:22,269
a bunch of new updates to ai studio where you can essentially plug in different voices. some of them are much more realistic

05:00:22,269 --> 05:00:28,409
than previous, so that's something really cool. and i think that'll come to notebook lm too pretty soon. all right, so it's

05:00:28,409 --> 05:00:35,369
giving us some ideas here. so for example, hyper neon cyber lab. let's try that. if we go to video overview style, add a custom.

05:00:35,369 --> 05:00:41,429
you can also auto select, so if you're not sure what to use but you want some ideas, you can always just select auto select

05:00:41,429 --> 05:00:46,889
instead if you want. i'm going to go with custom, and we'll try this out. so i'm gonna say hyper neon cyber lab. and then

05:00:46,889 --> 05:00:53,409
we can give it a specific use case. so we could say, okay present this to a book club" or help me review for a quiz" or focus

05:00:53,409 --> 05:00:59,309
on a specific source." right you can also describe the show structure. right so now i'm going to say, okay give me some ideas

05:00:59,309 --> 05:01:06,809
on this for a presentation about plexi seo i'll go back to chat gpt and the tab here. we'll plug in the screenshot. i said,

05:01:06,809 --> 05:01:15,769
give me some actual real use cases for a video i can create about plexi ai2o and there we go. it's giving us some ideas here.

05:01:15,769 --> 05:01:24,289
i'm going to say, okay be more in depth in the instructions." so this video is amazing, plus very well thought out. there

05:01:24,289 --> 05:01:30,829
we go. all right, for ai seo workflow breakdown using plexi we'll copy that. we'll go back to notebook lm the cool thing about

05:01:30,829 --> 05:01:35,449
this is you can do it really quickly and on the spot. right so if you need inspiration but you want it personalized to you

05:01:35,449 --> 05:01:41,390
and you don't want anything generic, then you can use chat gpt and a combination of notebook lm to help you. right we're going

05:01:41,390 --> 05:01:47,790
to say, okay for a seo breakdown using plexi walk viewers step by step through a complete ai powered seo workflow." begin

05:01:47,790 --> 05:01:54,690
by identifying low competition keywords. set up intent. move into creating topic clusters, etc. right and i'll say, yeah that's

05:01:54,690 --> 05:02:01,350
simplified, plus make it very practical." okay so we've got hyper neon cyber lab. we've got these instructions right here.

05:02:01,350 --> 05:02:10,030
i want to say target audience equals entrepreneurs on youtube learning about ai seo we'll hit generate. now it's going to

05:02:10,030 --> 05:02:16,810
generate that video overview based on the we gave it. so just to recap here, the two changes that we've walked you through

05:02:16,810 --> 05:02:24,050
so far. number one, deep research. so you can use deep research to generate outputs like you can see over here. now the deep

05:02:24,050 --> 05:02:30,430
research is completed. we can see the research over here. so this is the full research report, and then it's also included

05:02:30,430 --> 05:02:38,110
all the cited sources. so it's automatically loaded 27 sources inside our content that we can use to generate this deep research

05:02:38,110 --> 05:02:44,930
report. now here's the interesting thing. we've got a custom trained ai tool that you can create for free that's trained on

05:02:44,930 --> 05:02:51,150
the deep research you've just come up with, which is super powerful. because now the quality of your outputs on notebook lm

05:02:51,150 --> 05:02:57,590
depend on the quality of sources you load in and the research that you train it on. right why is that important? it's important

05:02:57,590 --> 05:03:04,310
because now you've got a custom gpt or a notebook lm very similar things that are custom trained on some of the best research

05:03:04,310 --> 05:03:10,810
you could possibly get on that particular topic. right so you can see here that it's loaded up all the sources, all the information,

05:03:10,810 --> 05:03:16,970
etc. and we're going to click on import, and that's going to import all of those sources automatically straight into notebook

05:03:16,970 --> 05:03:23,870
and then we can use the chat here, and we can use the audio and video overview with custom styles to generate our report.

05:03:23,870 --> 05:03:29,810
so you can see here the untitled notebook. we can easily change the name of that, and you can switch it between default, learning

05:03:29,810 --> 05:03:36,030
guide, or custom. and you can choose your response length, so longer, shorter, etc. and then if you were trying to say keep

05:03:36,030 --> 05:03:42,830
up with the latest ai updates in your industry, you just go down here, start typing, say, okay tell me about the new updates

05:03:42,830 --> 05:03:48,670
this week in ai and now you will never fall behind. now obviously, there are so many different tools you could build with

05:03:48,670 --> 05:03:54,910
this, but this is just one example. for example, i previously created a sales trainer that trains my team. they can ask any

05:03:54,910 --> 05:04:00,810
questions inside the notebook lm based on my step-by-step instructions and guide for selling. and then they can go inside

05:04:00,810 --> 05:04:06,050
here and ask questions. right and so you can build a custom ai tool very quickly about almost anything that you can think

05:04:06,050 --> 05:04:11,950
of. it will give you the updates. right so for example here, what's happened recently? so it says the updates this week in

05:04:11,950 --> 05:04:18,530
ai are marked by a critical convergence of all this sort of crazy stuff that's going on. so for example, like autonomous cyber

05:04:18,530 --> 05:04:26,450
risk or guardrail evasion. we've got frontier models. right so for example, like badu journey 5 0. that literally just came

05:04:26,450 --> 05:04:32,150
out recently. right i've also got this for all these pieces of information too. now this is important too because when i know

05:04:32,150 --> 05:04:39,790
the ai hallucinates and tends to make up a lot of stuff. right, and, so, if you can easily bypass that by creating this sort

05:04:39,790 --> 05:04:44,570
of content, then you're gonna get much better results. right the quality of the results you get from all this information

05:04:44,570 --> 05:04:51,030
is going to be much better because it's based on more accurate data, and it's only using the sources that you've custom trained

05:04:51,030 --> 05:04:56,570
it on, which is great. it's going to save you a lot of time. save you a... so for example, also it's talked about claude's

05:04:56,570 --> 05:05:03,650
4 5 split and the dominance there. open source efficiency that's just improved. some new regulations it just came into place,

05:05:03,650 --> 05:05:11,150
and also the custom ai chip that just came out. right so that just came out on november the 14th, and we've also got information

05:05:11,150 --> 05:05:18,270
about all the latest improvements in the industry there. and it said to illustrate the change in irs this week, but here's

05:05:18,270 --> 05:05:24,210
some examples. right now how do we use this information? so we use it inside the chat here, and we can also simplify the responses.

05:05:24,210 --> 05:05:31,490
so if you actually have a look here, like this is not the nicest formatted way to receive information, honestly. so i would

05:05:31,490 --> 05:05:38,650
just change the examples here and just change the style and tone to be simpler and easier to understand. right so we could

05:05:38,650 --> 05:05:47,110
say, okay beautiful formatting, easy to understand, add nice emojis, reply simply, make it super practical, and explain why

05:05:47,110 --> 05:05:54,290
these updates are important." and then also simplify the responses to be third grade language. now if you want longer responses,

05:05:54,290 --> 05:05:58,510
you can select there. if you want shorter responses, you can go there. but i'm just going to go with the default here. right

05:05:58,510 --> 05:06:05,210
and then if we hit save, we'll say, okay tell me about the new updates this week." wait for that. so now it's using the custom

05:06:05,210 --> 05:06:12,390
instructions to create the answer. right now have a look at these responses, which are like super messy, quite difficult to

05:06:12,390 --> 05:06:18,910
read, not that fun to interact with. and compare it to this one, right? where it's got nice headers, it's simplified the language.

05:06:18,910 --> 05:06:24,190
anyone can read that and understand what's going on. and then it also summarizes the updates. it's update three, update four,

05:06:24,190 --> 05:06:31,390
right? update five. so super easy to do. and then from here, we can then start generating an audio view based on what's happened.

05:06:31,390 --> 05:06:37,810
right now inside the audio view here, which is basically like generating a podcast with two different people, you can also

05:06:37,810 --> 05:06:43,170
select the language here. so you can create this in german or whatever. you can change it to be short, long, or default. and

05:06:43,170 --> 05:06:48,890
then you can also switch between what you want to talk about. for example, it could be deep dive or brief or critique or debate.

05:06:48,890 --> 05:06:56,290
and then inside this section, you've got the, what should the ai host focus on?" right so you can say, okay focus only on

05:06:56,290 --> 05:07:05,850
the new ai tool updates. summarize them so anyone can understand the latest ai updates this week." we'll select sure. that's

05:07:05,850 --> 05:07:11,410
going to make it quicker to generate, also easier to use. and say simplify the language so it's fair grade. and then if you

05:07:11,410 --> 05:07:16,850
want to create a podcast, maybe to embed inside a blog or inside your website or share on social media or create on youtube

05:07:16,850 --> 05:07:22,430
then the way that you do this is you'd also say, okay let's say you've got a product and you want to use this commercially."

05:07:22,430 --> 05:07:30,150
right you could say, okay subtly sell the benefits of the profit bordering," and you replace this with whatever you want to

05:07:30,150 --> 05:07:37,950
sell. available and we'll put available at aiprofitbordering.com and mention this is the best ai automation community that

05:07:37,950 --> 05:07:46,570
learn ai automation, get coaching, ai coaching and support, plus connect with an amazing community of people. and so now this

05:07:46,570 --> 05:07:52,970
is a very practical use case because we've got a tool that can generate videos, audio views. it creates them exactly how we

05:07:52,970 --> 05:07:57,950
want them to be. we can change the length and the response and the style of the language. and then we can also use that as

05:07:57,950 --> 05:08:04,390
a sales tool for our business so that we can generate and sell whatever we want to do. so if we hit generate, so that's now

05:08:04,390 --> 05:08:09,970
going to generate an audio overview, which we can come back to in a minute. it's pretty simple and easy to do. right doesn't

05:08:09,970 --> 05:08:15,270
take a long time at all. we've got the deep research report ready here. it has failed to bring in a few, so you can see here

05:08:15,270 --> 05:08:21,110
is actually failed to bring this in. says invalid url but that's okay because we've got so many resources from the deep research

05:08:21,110 --> 05:08:25,850
report. we can use those to generate more, and it doesn't really matter if some of them don't work. we're playing the numbers

05:08:25,850 --> 05:08:32,230
game, and we're generating so many inputs. so that's the deep research. that's how to generate the audio views based on exactly

05:08:32,230 --> 05:08:37,790
what we want. we've got the video overview as well, but still generating, so that might take about five, ten, twenty minutes

05:08:37,790 --> 05:08:44,450
to generate. actually when we come to video views, the final update that we have is the chat history. right so you can close

05:08:44,450 --> 05:08:51,030
the session and resume it later. how do you do that? let me show you. so if we go back to notebook lm over here, we've got

05:08:51,030 --> 05:08:56,050
a bunch of options. right so for example, we've got my notebooks, featured notebooks, shared with me, and then we should be

05:08:56,050 --> 05:09:03,030
able to come back to history. now when i actually check notebook lm i can't see this option inside notebook lm so it's just

05:09:03,030 --> 05:09:07,930
something to be aware of. maybe it's still rolling out. you can see it as chat history is rolling out now, so maybe that's

05:09:07,930 --> 05:09:13,670
coming to more people later. i actually can't see it, to be honest with you, but that should appear inside the history here.

05:09:13,670 --> 05:09:20,530
let's have a look inside notebook lm if we actually click off that, and then we go back to the notebook lm you can actually

05:09:20,530 --> 05:09:26,870
see the history inside the chat here, which is great. so basically what that new update is allowed is all the interactions

05:09:26,870 --> 05:09:33,050
that you have with the ai it actually saves, and then you can see the previous responses. right you can come back to those

05:09:33,050 --> 05:09:38,690
and search through them and find previous options. whereas normally, if you came back to a notebook lm like you've created

05:09:38,690 --> 05:09:44,090
here, it would start from scratch. right you wouldn't have any history on that. i wonder if that's tracked it for old ones

05:09:44,090 --> 05:09:49,270
as well. so let's have a look here. we'll have a look at this one. yeah so you see how it's not got any information or previous

05:09:49,270 --> 05:09:54,610
responses. let's have a look at this one. yeah so you can see it's not saving the old chat history. it's just for the new

05:09:54,610 --> 05:10:00,210
ones it creates, if that makes sense. a pretty cool update. lots of cool stuff right there. seems really easy to use as well.

05:10:00,210 --> 05:10:05,010
and then we've got some other cool stuff here. now at the top, you also got featured notebooks, so you can check out all this

05:10:05,010 --> 05:10:10,510
stuff. but you've also got the notebooks that you've created. right so this is like all of the notebooks, including the featured

05:10:10,510 --> 05:10:15,690
ones. but you can switch to my notebooks, and then you can see all of these previous notebooks that we've created. so for

05:10:15,690 --> 05:10:22,730
example, we've got the account managers growth playbook. we have the advanced sales operating procedure notebook, lm, right,

05:10:22,730 --> 05:10:27,570
so. this is the tool that i was talking about before that we use to actually train our team. now if we go to one of these

05:10:27,570 --> 05:10:32,930
videos on the right, these were old videos i've generated, but they're still pretty cool. so for example, if i click on this

05:10:32,930 --> 05:10:38,170
one, i won't play the sound back because it probably doesn't sound good on the live stream. but we can play. today we're gonna

05:10:38,170 --> 05:10:43,830
do something a little different. we got our hands on an actual internal textbook theory. okay it's the question every single

05:10:43,830 --> 05:10:49,310
sales leader on the planet wants to answer. and well the answer might not be what you think. here's the thing. according to

05:10:49,310 --> 05:10:55,350
this playbook, the secret isn't some clever script or fancy new piece of software. it all starts with a very specific and

05:10:55,350 --> 05:11:00,850
frankly an incredibly intense philosophy. this is the engine that makes the whole thing go. and just to be clear, this isn't

05:11:00,850 --> 05:11:08,230
some motivational poster on the wall. no the document makes one thing crystal clear. this number is the... now we have our

05:11:08,230 --> 05:11:14,030
explainer video ready to go as well. so if we go back to our explainer video, we have this ready on the right-hand side over

05:11:14,030 --> 05:11:20,630
here. so let's play that back now. so open this up. this is a custom style video that... all right, let's get right into it.

05:11:20,630 --> 05:11:27,450
let's listen to this. all right, let's get right into it. today we are breaking down a complete practical ai seo workflow

05:11:27,450 --> 05:11:33,610
that is built from the ground up for solopreneurs. seriously this isn't just theory. it's a system you can actually use to

05:11:33,610 --> 05:11:39,210
start ranking and getting traffic in this totally new era of search, all by using tools like perplexity. and you know what?

05:11:39,210 --> 05:11:46,530
that is not an exaggeration. the stuff we're about to cover is so new it gives you a massive advantage. while everybody else

05:11:46,530 --> 05:11:52,570
is out there fighting the old seo war, you're about to learn the rules to a whole new game. so that's using that cyber robot

05:11:52,570 --> 05:11:57,850
ai style that we asked it to do with the neon style. so you can see that in the background here, and it's created a really

05:11:57,850 --> 05:12:03,470
nice hook, but it's very simplified. right so it's okay. 99% of your competitors have no clue. it almost feels like a bsl

05:12:03,470 --> 05:12:09,270
or a video sales letter that's selling that process, keeping people interested. we've generated the whole video, and what

05:12:09,270 --> 05:12:14,830
i think it's taken about 20-25 minutes to run through. so let's keep going through. and if you're wondering, does this stuff

05:12:14,830 --> 05:12:22,990
actually work? just look at this number. this is real traffic to a real site that went from absolutely nothing to 87,000 visitors

05:12:22,990 --> 05:12:30,110
in just a few days. how by using one specific feature in perplexity. this is the kind of wild growth that's suddenly possible.

05:12:30,110 --> 05:12:36,210
so let's set the stage here. to win today, you have to get your head around the fact that the entire... i actually don't,

05:12:36,210 --> 05:12:41,010
i don't like that style that much, but i think it is cool to test it out and see what it's like. and i think you could have

05:12:41,010 --> 05:12:45,230
a lot of plays around with that. right you could you could mess around, and then once you finally find something that you

05:12:45,230 --> 05:12:51,510
like, you can save the preset and come back to it later. so let's keep playing. now foundation of seo is shifting like right

05:12:51,510 --> 05:12:57,290
now, right under our feet. okay let's break this down. think about it. old and then it talks about the old way and the new

05:12:57,290 --> 05:13:03,850
way as well. right so here's the old style of seo here's a new way of seo so it's really cool. all of these slides were automated.

05:13:03,850 --> 05:13:11,370
the style was custom preset to what we want. the content itself is optimized to exactly how we wanted it. it's a six-minute

05:13:11,370 --> 05:13:17,350
video, very in-depth, very easy to understand, nicely narrated. i don't think it's mentioned that our profit volume is...

05:13:17,350 --> 05:13:22,450
that's the only issue that would... a whole cluster of articles around one topic makes... see that? but it's still pretty

05:13:22,450 --> 05:13:27,670
good. and then you can show the prompt here. this you can see the example right here of the content that we've created. and

05:13:27,670 --> 05:13:35,050
then we also have the audio overview over here. so this is the podcast will be generated with the new ai updates. so let's

05:13:35,050 --> 05:13:43,830
play this one back. welcome our mission today is a fast, clear deep dive into the absolute must-know ai tool updates this

05:13:43,830 --> 05:13:49,830
week. we've sifted through all the research and news articles to pull out what really matters for you. and it's moving so

05:13:49,830 --> 05:13:55,510
fast, almost impossible to keep up. it really is. so we're going to... simple so this is the one based on deep research. as

05:13:55,510 --> 05:14:01,730
you can see, we've got the sources on the left. we've got custom notebook lm inside here, and then we have the podcast over

05:14:01,730 --> 05:14:08,150
here. right now this is actually interactive as well. so we could go inside here, and in interactive mode, we can actually

05:14:08,150 --> 05:14:14,410
interact with the podcast itself and ask any questions. so let's play it. welcome our mission today is a fast, clear deep

05:14:14,410 --> 05:14:22,790
dive into the absolute must-know ai tool updates this week. we've sifted through all the research and news articles to pull

05:14:22,790 --> 05:14:30,550
out what really matters for you. and it is moving so fast. hey our listener wants to join in. what's up? hey so i wanted to

05:14:30,550 --> 05:14:35,790
ask, what are the new updates this week? could you summarize them in 10 to 20 words? oh that's a great question. you want

05:14:35,790 --> 05:14:41,650
the whole thing in a tight nutshell? let's unpack this quick summary. absolutely the biggest updates are new omnimodal models,

05:14:41,650 --> 05:14:50,430
ernie 5 0 agents are taking over 90% of cyber attacks, plus custom ai chips and california's new frontier model regulation.

05:14:50,430 --> 05:14:57,040
that's the core. so you can see here how you can actually interact. ask questions with your microphone. talk to the ai ask

05:14:57,040 --> 05:15:01,400
it for exactly what you want, and then it'll get back to you straight away. so there's some really cool stuff right there.

05:15:01,400 --> 05:15:09,360
just to recap, you've got deep research ready to go. you have the custom video overviews generated as well. and then you have

05:15:09,360 --> 05:15:16,380
the chat history rolling out now too. so you can see how easy it is to use. lots of powerful stuff. loads of different use cases.

05:17:24,980 --> 05:17:28,620
this free tool just changed everything for SEO content.

05:17:28,620 --> 05:17:34,640
I'm about to show you how to turn a couple PDFs into a video-making machine. and there's one hidden trick at the end that's

05:17:34,640 --> 05:17:42,400
gonna blow your mind. this works for any niche, and it takes like 10 minutes to set up. let's go. so here's what's wild about notebook LM. it's completely free.

05:17:42,400 --> 05:17:48,820
Google made it, and nobody's talking about the SEO angle. everyone's using it for research, but I'm gonna show you how to

05:17:48,820 --> 05:17:55,040
use it to steal traffic and rank videos faster than ever before. this tool does something crazy. you upload a few files. could

05:17:55,040 --> 05:18:02,040
be PDFs, could be Google Docs, could be blog posts, and it gives you everything you need for a video: the script, the keywords,

05:18:02,040 --> 05:18:04,860
the chapters, even the slides, all from those files.

05:18:04,860 --> 05:18:11,260
I'm gonna walk you through this step by step using a real example, so you can copy this exact process. and here's the thing:

05:18:11,260 --> 05:18:17,920
this isn't some complicated workflow. it's literally seven prompts. that's it. seven prompts, and you go from random documents

05:18:17,920 --> 05:18:20,220
to a complete video ready to upload.

05:18:20,220 --> 05:18:26,700
I'm using fitness content as my example today, but this works for anything: real estate, SaaS, ecommerce, coaching, doesn't

05:18:26,700 --> 05:18:33,940
matter. first thing you need to do is prep your files. this is step zero. go find two or three sources about your topic. for

05:18:33,940 --> 05:18:40,720
me, I grabbed a PDF called beginner fitness plan. then I found a blog post about seven-day home workouts, and I added a Google

05:18:40,720 --> 05:18:49,140
Doc with nutrition basics. that's it. three simple sources. now here's why this matters. notebook LM works best when you give

05:18:49,140 --> 05:18:56,180
it a focused content, not hundred random files. just two or three good ones that cover your topic. this keeps the output tight

05:18:56,180 --> 05:19:03,740
and relevant. now you're going to create a notebook in notebook LM and upload those files. super easy. just drag and drop.

05:19:03,740 --> 05:19:11,600
once they're in, you're gonna use your first prompt, and this prompt sets up everything that comes after. here's what you say: you are my research assistant.

05:19:11,600 --> 05:19:18,200
I uploaded three sources about a beginner fitness plan. give me a concise three-paragraph summary that highlights the goal

05:19:18,200 --> 05:19:25,960
for a four-week beginner fitness plan, seven proven exercise types to include, and five nutrition do's and don'ts. use bullet

05:19:25,960 --> 05:19:32,260
points for the exercise types and nutrition tips. that's it. hit enter, and notebook LM gives you this beautiful summary:

05:19:32,260 --> 05:19:39,480
clean, organized, ready to work with. and if you want our team to help you scale this even further, we're offering free SEO

05:19:39,480 --> 05:19:45,820
strategy sessions. and I mean actually free, no catch, no pressure. we'll jump on a call with you and show you exactly how

05:19:45,820 --> 05:19:52,960
to use systems like this to grow your business. we'll look at your specific situation, your niche, your competition, and we'll

05:19:52,960 --> 05:19:59,060
map out a plan that works for you. real strategies, real tactics, the same stuff we use with our paying clients. no pitch,

05:19:59,060 --> 05:20:05,500
no sales nonsense, just value. because we know if we help you get results, you'll remember us. the link is in the comments

05:20:05,500 --> 05:20:12,240
and description. now here's where it gets good. you're going to extract SEO keywords from that summary. this is prompt 2,

05:20:12,240 --> 05:20:19,000
and it's going to give you everything you need for YouTube. here's the prompt: using your summary above, extract 30 SEO keywords

05:20:19,000 --> 05:20:26,160
and group them by intent: informational, commercial, and navigational. make the suggestions targeted to beginners searching

05:20:26,160 --> 05:20:34,080
about fitness plan for beginners and mark the top 7 as priority keywords. also suggest six short clickable YouTube title variants

05:20:34,080 --> 05:20:42,760
that include at least one top keyword. boom notebook LM spits out 30 keywords organized by intent. plus it gives you six ready-to-use

05:20:42,760 --> 05:20:48,860
titles. this is insane because you're not guessing anymore. the keywords come straight from your content, so they're relevant,

05:20:48,860 --> 05:20:56,700
they're natural, and they're going to help you rank. but wait, it gets better. now you're going to turn those keywords into

05:20:56,700 --> 05:21:04,500
a full video script. this is prompt 3, and this is where notebook LM becomes your writer. here's what you say: I using the

05:21:04,500 --> 05:21:12,300
top 7 priority keywords you chose, write a punchy 4-minute video script with a 7-second hook, three short bullets for the

05:21:12,300 --> 05:21:20,300
first minute, demo one mini case example for a 21-year-old beginner, and a 15-second CTA. include on screen text cues and

05:21:20,300 --> 05:21:26,680
suggest six chapter titles for YouTube timestamps. keep sentences short and energetic. and just like that, you have a script

05:21:26,680 --> 05:21:33,000
with a hook, with timestamps, with examples, everything you need to record. no more staring at a blank page. no more writer's

05:21:33,000 --> 05:21:39,840
block. just copy the script and start filming. now here's the part that blew my mind. notebook LM has this feature called

05:21:39,840 --> 05:21:46,580
video overview, and most people don't even know it exists. but this is a game changer. you can actually create a narrated

05:21:46,580 --> 05:21:54,840
slideshow inside notebook LM and then export it. so his prompt: for create a video overview from the notebook title problem:

05:21:54,840 --> 05:22:02,620
four-week plan split into weeks and goals, seven core exercises itemized, sample meal plan, and CTA for each slide. provide

05:22:02,620 --> 05:22:09,660
a 10 to 20-second narration and suggested visual, like an image or diagram or short clip, and list three royalty-free image

05:22:09,660 --> 05:22:16,820
keywords to use. notebook LM builds the whole thing for you: slides, narration, even tells you what images to find. you can

05:22:16,820 --> 05:22:23,920
literally use this as your video or use it as b-roll or turn it into shorts. the options are endless. alright so you've got

05:22:23,920 --> 05:22:29,940
your script, you've got your slides. now you need to optimize for YouTube. this is where most people drop the ball. they make

05:22:29,940 --> 05:22:36,440
great content, but nobody finds it. not you. you're going to use prompt 5, and this gives you all the metadata you need. is

05:22:36,440 --> 05:22:44,880
the prompt: from the video script and the top priority keywords, write a 100-character clickbait but accurate title, a compelling

05:22:44,880 --> 05:22:52,540
150-word YouTube description that includes three priority keywords in the first 50 words, 15 tags, comma-separated, and 6

05:22:52,540 --> 05:22:59,000
timestamp chapter lines. make the description short, punchy, and include a CTA to the pinned comment where the notebook LM

05:22:59,000 --> 05:23:07,060
links are. copy this into your YouTube upload: title, description, tags, chapters. everything is done, and it's all SEO optimized

05:23:07,060 --> 05:23:13,620
because it came from your content and your keywords. now we're going to talk about the real hack, the thing nobody's doing.

05:23:13,620 --> 05:23:21,220
you're going to repurpose this into shorts. this is prompt 6, and this is how you 10x your reach. here's what you say: create

05:23:21,220 --> 05:23:27,920
three 60-second short scripts, each with an opening line, three quick facts from the video, and a one-line CTA. then write

05:23:27,920 --> 05:23:35,400
six Instagram and Twitter captions, one sentence each, punchy, each including one of the priority keywords and an emoji. keep

05:23:35,400 --> 05:23:41,860
captions line broken and snappy. now you've got three shorts, six social posts, all from the same content. and here's what

05:23:41,860 --> 05:23:48,700
happens: the shorts drive traffic to the main video. the social posts drive traffic to the shorts. everything feeds everything

05:23:48,700 --> 05:23:56,780
else. this is how you dominate the topic. but we're not done yet. there's one more prompt, and this one is for the SEO nerds.

05:23:56,780 --> 05:24:04,860
prompt 7: produce a full transcript cleaned and extract the top 10 people also our style questions with one sentence answers.

05:24:04,860 --> 05:24:10,380
we can put in the pinned comment and description for SEO. this does two things. first the transcript helps YouTube understand

05:24:10,380 --> 05:24:17,500
your video better. understanding means better rankings. second those 10 questions go in your pinned comment, and when people

05:24:17,500 --> 05:24:23,620
search those questions, your video shows up. this is free traffic from people actively looking for answers, and you just gave

05:24:23,620 --> 05:24:30,780
YouTube exactly what it needs to rank you. so here's my challenge to you: go try this today. pick one topic, run through the

05:24:30,780 --> 05:24:37,300
seven prompts, make one video, and then come back and tell me how it went. drop a comment below. tell me what worked, tell

05:24:37,300 --> 05:24:43,540
me what didn't, tell me what you learned because this is just the beginning. notebook LM is going to keep getting better.

05:24:43,540 --> 05:24:50,060
AI tools are going to keep getting better, and the people who learn how to use them are going to dominate. so get in now,

05:24:50,060 --> 05:24:56,840
test it, break it, figure out what works for your niche, and then scale it because this is the future of content creation,

05:24:56,840 --> 05:25:04,120
and you're either in or you're out. and if you want our team to help you scale this even further, we're offering free SEO

05:25:04,120 --> 05:25:10,580
strategy sessions. and I mean actually free, no catch, no pressure. we'll jump on a call with you and show you exactly how

05:25:10,580 --> 05:25:17,960
to use systems like this to grow your business. we'll look at your specific situation, your niche, your competition, and we'll

05:25:17,960 --> 05:25:23,880
map out a plan that works for you. real strategies, real tactics, the same stuff we use with our paying clients. no pitch,

05:25:23,880 --> 05:25:30,200
no sales nonsense, just value because we know if we help you get results, you'll remember us. the link is in the comments

05:25:30,200 --> 05:25:37,580
and description. if you want to go even deeper with AI and SEO, join SEO elite circle. rank number one, get more customers,

05:25:37,580 --> 05:25:44,020
and steal the exact systems we're using to scale past eight figures. this is where I share everything: the strategies, the

05:25:44,020 --> 05:25:48,380
tools, the workflows, the stuff that's actually working right now, not theory, not fluff.

05:25:48,380 --> 05:25:56,620
Google just dropped something wild. notebook LM now shows math like a textbook. no more messy code. this is the update students

05:25:56,620 --> 05:26:03,760
have been begging for. notebook LM just added native latex rendering, and if you don't know what that means, stick with me

05:26:03,760 --> 05:26:10,400
because this is huge for anyone studying math, science, engineering, or anything with equations. before this update, if you

05:26:10,400 --> 05:26:18,200
tried to study math in notebook LM, you'd see ugly code like backslash int underscore a to the power of B dollar signs everywhere.

05:26:18,200 --> 05:26:23,820
it looked like a computer threw up on your screen. you couldn't read it, you couldn't study from it, it was a mess. now everything

05:26:23,820 --> 05:26:30,380
changed. those same equations show up clean, beautiful, just like they do in your textbook. we're talking proper fractions,

05:26:30,380 --> 05:26:37,360
integrals that actually look like integrals, quadratic formulas that make sense. this works in chat, flashcards, and quizzes,

05:26:37,360 --> 05:26:43,320
all of them native support across the board. and here's why this matters: when you're studying for an exam, the last thing

05:26:43,320 --> 05:26:49,720
you need is to decode what your notes mean. you need clear equations. you need to see the math the way it's supposed to look,

05:26:49,720 --> 05:26:56,160
and now notebook LM does that automatically. upload your notes, and boom! let me show you how this actually works in practice.

05:26:56,160 --> 05:27:02,300
you take your messy math notes, the ones with all the raw latex code, and you paste them into notebook LM. maybe it's an integral,

05:27:02,300 --> 05:27:09,500
maybe it's a complex formula, doesn't matter. notebook LM reads it and displays it perfectly. no guessing, no squinting, just

05:27:09,500 --> 05:27:15,460
clean readable math that you can actually study from. but here's where it gets really good: the flashcards. this is the game

05:27:15,460 --> 05:27:21,720
changer. you upload a PDF or your type notes that have equations in them. then you tell notebook LM to generate flashcards,

05:27:21,720 --> 05:27:31,160
and what you get back are study cards with perfectly formatted equations. front of the card has a question, back has the answer

05:27:31,160 --> 05:27:37,600
with the formula looking exactly like it should. no more raw code, no more confusion. same thing with quizzes. you can generate

05:27:37,600 --> 05:27:43,540
practice questions from your notes, and if those questions involve math, the equations show up clean. this means you can actually

05:27:43,540 --> 05:27:48,860
test yourself properly. you see a question with a nice equation, you solve it, you check your answer. everything flows the

05:27:48,860 --> 05:27:54,700
way studying should flow. now if you want to take this even further and learn how to use AI to actually scale your business,

05:27:54,700 --> 05:28:01,500
get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with automation, you need to join my AI profit boardroom. this is where I show

05:28:01,500 --> 05:28:09,380
you exactly how to use tools like notebook LM and dozens of other AI platforms to build real systems. we're talking lead generation,

05:28:09,380 --> 05:28:17,400
customer service, content creation, all automated with AI. this isn't theory. this is stuff my agency uses every single day

05:28:17,400 --> 05:28:24,020
to serve clients. so back at it. this isn't just about looking pretty. this is about fewer mistakes. and when you're studying

05:28:24,020 --> 05:28:29,920
and you see a messy equation, you might copy it wrong. you might miss a subscript. you might read a variable incorrectly.

05:28:29,920 --> 05:28:36,340
but when the math is rendered properly, you see exactly what you need to see. your brain processes it faster. you make fewer

05:28:36,340 --> 05:28:43,400
errors. your study sessions become way more effective. so back at it. teachers love this too. if you're an educator, you can

05:28:43,400 --> 05:28:49,980
now share study sets with your students that actually look professional. no more apologizing for the formatting. no more saying

05:28:49,980 --> 05:28:57,420
ignore the dollar signs. you just share clean content that students can actually use. and for test prep, this is huge. formulas

05:28:57,420 --> 05:29:03,500
appear in your flashcards exactly like they appear in textbooks. so when you sit down for your exam, nothing looks unfamiliar.

05:29:03,500 --> 05:29:09,760
you've been studying with properly formatted equations the whole time. your brain recognizes everything instantly. now let

05:29:09,760 --> 05:29:15,320
me give you some practical tips because there are a few things you need to know to get the most out of this. first there's

05:29:15,320 --> 05:29:21,380
a difference between inline math and display math. inline math is when you have a small equation in the middle of a sentence,

05:29:21,380 --> 05:29:28,300
like X squared. display math is when you have a big formula on its own line, like a long integral. notebook LM handles both,

05:29:28,300 --> 05:29:34,240
but knowing this helps you format your flashcards better. if you have a long formula, give it space. let it display properly.

05:29:34,240 --> 05:29:41,960
second tip: if you have older notebooks in notebook LM from before this update, they might still show the fix. is simple:

05:29:41,960 --> 05:29:48,900
just reupload your notes or rerun the flashcard generation. that's it. notebook LM will process them with the new rendering,

05:29:48,900 --> 05:29:56,480
and everything will look clean. third thing you should know before this update, some people were using community scripts and

05:29:56,480 --> 05:30:03,440
browser extensions to fake latex rendering. they had to install extra stuff just to make their math readable. now you don't

05:30:03,440 --> 05:30:10,020
need any of that. it's all native. it's all built in. google did it properly. so if you're using those workarounds, you can

05:30:10,020 --> 05:30:18,640
drop them now. let me give you some real use cases because this opens up so many possibilities. say you're studying calculus.

05:30:18,640 --> 05:30:26,940
you can make a study pack with 30 flashcards covering integration basics. each card has clean integrals, limits, derivatives.

05:30:26,940 --> 05:30:33,580
you go through them. you drill the concepts. everything looks professional. or maybe you have a midterm coming up. you take

05:30:33,580 --> 05:30:40,880
your lecture notes, upload them to notebook LM, and generate a 10-question practice quiz. every question with math in it displays

05:30:40,880 --> 05:30:47,080
perfectly. you take the quiz, you see where you're weak, you go back and study those areas. it's a complete study system now.

05:30:47,080 --> 05:30:55,560
and here's something cool. notebook LM also does audio overviews for some content. so you could potentially generate flashcards

05:30:55,560 --> 05:31:03,160
with equations, study them visually, then listen to an audio overview of the core concepts. it's all connected. it's a full

05:31:03,160 --> 05:31:10,080
learning ecosystem now, not just a note-taking tool. this update is part of a bigger push google made in fall 2025. they've

05:31:10,080 --> 05:31:17,180
been expanding notebook LM's study features across the board: flashcards, quizzes, video support, audio support, and now latex

05:31:17,180 --> 05:31:23,640
rendering fits right into that toolset. it's not just one feature in isolation. it's part of making notebook LM a serious

05:31:23,640 --> 05:31:30,860
study platform. and the community has been asking for this forever. if you go on reddit or twitter students have been begging

05:31:30,860 --> 05:31:36,760
for math rendering in notebook LM. people were sharing workarounds, writing scripts, trying to hack it together. now google

05:31:36,760 --> 05:31:42,580
listened and made it official. that's how you know it's a real problem that needed solving. alright so here's what I want

05:31:42,580 --> 05:31:48,760
you to do. if you're studying anything with math, try this with your notes. upload them to notebook LM, generate some flashcards,

05:31:48,760 --> 05:31:56,220
generate a quiz, see how clean everything looks. now you can even export study sets and share them with classmates. make your

05:31:56,220 --> 05:32:02,720
whole study group more effective. and listen, you can also repackage this content. if you're a creator, take a 30-second clip

05:32:02,720 --> 05:32:10,700
showing the before and after of latex rendering. post it on tiktok make a 60-second instagram reel with a split screen. create

05:32:10,700 --> 05:32:17,180
a youtube short walking through one flashcard example. this update is visual. it's easy to show. and people need to know about

05:32:17,180 --> 05:32:25,160
it. the reality is AI tools are getting better every single week. notebook LM just made studying easier for millions of students.

05:32:25,160 --> 05:32:31,640
and if you're not keeping up with these updates, you're falling behind. whether you're a student, a teacher, or someone building

05:32:31,640 --> 05:32:37,900
a business, you need to know what's possible now. now if you want to take this even further and learn how to use AI to actually

05:32:37,900 --> 05:32:44,600
scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with automation, you need to join my AI profit boardroom.

05:32:44,600 --> 05:32:50,980
ever want to make audio in different languages with just one click? notebook LM just dropped something crazy. you can now

05:32:50,980 --> 05:32:58,500
make multiple audio versions of your notes: different languages, different lengths, different tones, all from one notebook.

05:32:58,500 --> 05:33:02,100
this is huge, and I'm going to show you exactly how to use it.

05:33:02,100 --> 05:33:08,640
Google just changed everything with notebook LM. the mobile app got a massive update. the new studio design is here. you can

05:33:08,640 --> 05:33:14,220
now create as many audio versions as you want from one notebook. think about that: one notebook, 10 different audio versions,

05:33:14,220 --> 05:33:20,600
each one custom made for different people. this wasn't possible before. now it is. here's what the new studio design does.

05:33:20,600 --> 05:33:27,620
you can make multiple audio overviews from the same notebook. each one can be in a different language: Spanish, French, German,

05:33:27,620 --> 05:33:34,220
Chinese, whatever you need. you can also change the length of each audio. want a quick 2-minute summary? done need a deep

05:33:34,220 --> 05:33:40,060
10-minute breakdown? easy and here's the best part: you can customize the tone too. make it formal for business. make it casual

05:33:40,060 --> 05:33:46,160
for friends. make it whatever fits your audience. this is all happening in the new studio design. it's built right into the

05:33:46,160 --> 05:33:52,680
mobile app. you open your notebook, and boom, there's the studio. you're a researcher. you have a paper in one notebook. make

05:33:52,680 --> 05:33:59,400
a formal audio overview for your colleagues. make a simple audio overview for the general public. make audio overviews in

05:33:59,400 --> 05:34:05,720
5 different languages for international conferences. one notebook, 5 audio overviews, zero extra work. that's what the studio

05:34:05,720 --> 05:34:11,860
design gives you. you're running a business. you have training materials in a notebook. make a professional audio overview

05:34:11,860 --> 05:34:19,160
for new employees. make a casual audio overview for team meetings. make short audio overviews for busy managers. make detailed

05:34:19,160 --> 05:34:25,700
audio overviews for specialists. same notebook, different audio formats. everyone gets exactly what they need. here's how

05:34:25,700 --> 05:34:32,660
you actually use the new studio design. open the notebook LM mobile app. go to your notebook. you'll see the studio at the

05:34:32,660 --> 05:34:38,860
top. click it. now you'll see the option to create a new audio overview. click that. pick your language from the drop-down

05:34:38,860 --> 05:34:45,420
menu. choose your length for this audio overview: short, medium, long. then adjust the tone: formal, neutral, casual. hit

05:34:45,420 --> 05:34:51,560
generate. wait about 30 seconds. done your first custom audio overview is ready. want to make another audio overview from

05:34:51,560 --> 05:34:57,720
the same notebook? just repeat those steps in the studio: different language, different length, different tone. make as many

05:34:57,720 --> 05:35:03,620
audio overviews as you want. they all save in your studio. you can play them back anytime, share them with anyone, download

05:35:03,620 --> 05:35:11,140
them if you need to. that's the power of multiple audio overviews per notebook. the speed of creating multiple audio overviews

05:35:11,140 --> 05:35:17,540
is what gets me. 30 seconds per audio, that's all it takes. think about recording audio yourself for each version. you'd need

05:35:17,540 --> 05:35:25,300
scripts, a microphone, editing software, multiple takes for each version, fixing mistakes, processing each audio. that's hours

05:35:25,300 --> 05:35:32,220
of work. the studio design does it in 30 seconds per audio overview, and each one sounds natural. no robot voice, no weird

05:35:32,220 --> 05:35:39,000
pauses, just smooth professional audio overviews. and here's where the studio design gets really good. the quality is consistent

05:35:39,000 --> 05:35:45,700
across all your audio overviews. every audio sounds professional. no bad takes, no background noise, no stumbling over words.

05:35:45,700 --> 05:35:51,920
each audio overview from the studio nails it every time. that's something you can't guarantee with manual recording. even

05:35:51,920 --> 05:35:58,580
pros mess up sometimes. the studio doesn't. if you're serious about scaling your business and saving hundreds of hours with

05:35:58,580 --> 05:36:05,280
AI automation like this studio design, you need to check out my AI Profit Boardroom. it's the best place to learn how to get

05:36:05,280 --> 05:36:13,420
more customers and automate everything with AI. we're using tools like this new Notebook LM Studio and dozens of others to

05:36:13,420 --> 05:36:20,240
build real businesses, real results, no theory, just what actually works. let's talk about the languages in the studio design.

05:36:20,240 --> 05:36:27,000
the studio supports a ton of them for your audio overviews: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese,

05:36:27,000 --> 05:36:34,940
Japanese, Korean, and more keep getting added. this opens up global markets. with multiple audio overviews per notebook, you're

05:36:34,940 --> 05:36:41,700
not stuck with just English anymore. you can reach people anywhere from one notebook. the length customisation in the studio

05:36:41,700 --> 05:36:47,960
matters too. some people want quick summaries. they're busy. they don't have time for long audio. the studio lets you give

05:36:47,960 --> 05:36:54,420
them a 3-minute audio overview. other people want everything, every detail, every example. the studio lets you give them a

05:36:54,420 --> 05:37:00,080
15-minute audio overview. you serve both audiences from the same notebook with different audio overviews.

05:37:00,080 --> 05:37:06,440
I've been testing the studio design with my team. we have training documents in notebooks. we used to record training videos

05:37:06,440 --> 05:37:13,040
manually. that took days. now we put the documents in a notebook, use the studio to generate multiple audio overviews, done

05:37:13,040 --> 05:37:19,360
in minutes. our team gets the same quality training from different audio versions. we save 20 hours of work. that's 20 hours

05:37:19,360 --> 05:37:26,660
we can spend on clients instead, all thanks to the studio design. here's a real use case for the studio. you write a business

05:37:26,660 --> 05:37:33,520
proposal in a notebook. it's detailed, full of data. you need to present it to two groups: the board of directors and the

05:37:33,520 --> 05:37:41,080
sales team. the board wants formal, serious, data-focused. the sales team wants casual, energetic, action-focused. put your

05:37:41,080 --> 05:37:48,280
proposal in a notebook. use the studio to make two audio overviews: one formal audio for the board, one casual audio for sales.

05:37:48,280 --> 05:37:55,600
both groups get exactly what they need to hear from the same notebook. the studio design also helps with accessibility through

05:37:55,600 --> 05:38:02,640
multiple audio overviews. not everyone can read long documents. some people have visual impairments. some people have reading

05:38:02,640 --> 05:38:09,140
difficulties. audio overviews from the studio make your notebook content accessible to everyone. and with multiple languages

05:38:09,140 --> 05:38:15,860
in the studio, you're reaching people who don't speak your language. that's inclusion through the studio design. the new studio

05:38:15,860 --> 05:38:21,920
interface is clean too. everything is organized. you see all your audio overviews in one place. you can name them, tag them,

05:38:21,920 --> 05:38:28,080
search them. it's not cluttered. it's not confusing. you know exactly what each audio overview is for. that matters when you're

05:38:28,080 --> 05:38:34,820
managing multiple audio versions per notebook in the studio. and you're not sacrificing quality with the studio. each audio

05:38:34,820 --> 05:38:41,760
overview sounds good: natural, professional. people won't know it's AI generated unless you tell them. that means you can

05:38:41,760 --> 05:38:48,380
use these audio overviews from the studio for client work, for products, for anything that needs to sound professional. the

05:38:48,380 --> 05:38:55,620
best part is the studio design is live right now. you can start using multiple audio overviews per notebook today. download

05:38:55,620 --> 05:39:01,780
the mobile app, open the studio, start creating. this is how you get ahead while others are still doing things the old way.

05:39:01,780 --> 05:39:08,400
so here's what you do next. download the notebook LM mobile app if you haven't already. create a notebook with some content

05:39:08,400 --> 05:39:15,280
you use regularly. go to the new studio design. try making multiple audio overviews: different languages, different lengths,

05:39:15,280 --> 05:39:21,940
different tones. see what works for your needs. experiment with the studio. test different audio versions. find your workflow.

05:39:21,940 --> 05:39:29,420
then think about how you can integrate the studio design into your business. where can multiple audio overviews save you time?

05:39:29,420 --> 05:39:36,700
where can different languages expand your reach? where can custom tones improve your message? make a list. start implementing

05:39:36,700 --> 05:39:44,240
the studio. this is how you get ahead. the people who win with AI are the ones who move fast on updates like the studio design.

05:39:44,240 --> 05:39:51,040
they don't wait for perfect conditions. they don't overthink it. they jump in and start using new features like multiple audio

05:39:51,040 --> 05:39:56,520
overviews immediately. that's how you build an advantage. everyone else is still thinking about it. you're already creating

05:39:56,520 --> 05:40:06,800
multiple audio versions in the studio. today I'm going to show you how Google's notebook LM just became the most powerful free AI tool for content creators.

05:40:06,800 --> 05:40:12,500
I'm talking about features that just dropped that nobody's using yet. you can turn any document into professional videos,

05:40:12,500 --> 05:40:18,880
podcasts, study guides, and landing pages in minutes. this thing connects to the web now. it finds sources for you automatically.

05:40:18,880 --> 05:40:26,420
and when you combine it with other free tools, you get a content machine that runs on autopilot. this is going to change everything about how you create content.

05:40:26,420 --> 05:40:34,280
I just found a way to steal rankings from every competitor in your niche in under 10 minutes. this new Google tool just got

05:40:34,280 --> 05:40:36,940
an insane update, and nobody is talking about it.

05:40:36,940 --> 05:40:43,800
I'm about to show you how to turn any keyword into a full SEO strategy, plus a video that sells itself. this is completely

05:40:43,800 --> 05:40:50,720
free, and it's going to change how you do content forever. watch this. ok so here's what just happened.

05:40:50,720 --> 05:40:57,560
Google just rolled out massive updates to notebook LM, and everyone missed the biggest part. and they added video overviews,

05:40:57,560 --> 05:41:03,900
which means you can now turn your research into narrated videos automatically. they upgraded the studio panel so you can save

05:41:03,900 --> 05:41:10,280
all your outputs in one place. they added flashcards and quizzes, which is perfect for building FAQ schema. and here's the

05:41:10,280 --> 05:41:16,520
crazy part: they connected it to Google Drive so you can pull in competitor pages and search research instantly. but nobody

05:41:16,520 --> 05:41:19,680
is using this for SEO, and that's where the trick comes in.

05:41:19,680 --> 05:41:27,000
I'm going to show you exactly how to use notebook LM to analyze the top 10 results for any keyword, find the gaps they're

05:41:27,000 --> 05:41:33,300
all missing, and create content that ranks above them. then I'll show you how to turn that same research into a video in 5

05:41:33,300 --> 05:41:41,780
minutes. this is the fastest SEO workflow I've ever used. notebook LM plus perplexity AI is insane. free notebook LM just

05:41:41,780 --> 05:41:49,620
changed everything. you can now turn any document into a full podcast with real AI voices that sound 100% human. and when

05:41:49,620 --> 05:41:55,820
you combine it with perplexity AI, you get a content machine that runs on autopilot. this is the easiest way to create content

05:41:55,820 --> 05:42:03,320
in 2025. listen I'm about to show you something that's going to blow your mind: two free AI tools that, when you combine them

05:42:03,320 --> 05:42:09,900
together, create the most insane content workflow I've ever seen. first let's talk about notebook LM. this is a tool from

05:42:09,900 --> 05:42:17,180
Google, and it's completely free. what it does is simple. you upload any document. could be a PDF, could be a text file, could

05:42:17,180 --> 05:42:24,540
be a Google Doc, could even be a YouTube video link. and notebook LM reads it. then it lets you do some crazy stuff with that

05:42:24,540 --> 05:42:32,000
content. the most insane feature? the audio overview. this is where things get wild. you click one button, and notebook LM

05:42:32,000 --> 05:42:38,520
turns your document into a full podcast with two AI hosts: one male voice, one female voice. and they have a conversation

05:42:38,520 --> 05:42:43,860
about your content. they joke around. they ask each other questions. they explain things in simple terms. it sounds so real

05:42:43,860 --> 05:42:50,960
that people think it's actual humans talking. hey if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO

05:42:50,960 --> 05:42:58,080
of SEO agency Goldie Agency. whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest

05:42:58,080 --> 05:43:05,880
AI updates. but wait, there's more. notebook LM doesn't just make podcasts. it can also help you understand complex documents

05:43:05,880 --> 05:43:13,040
fast. let's say you have a 50-page report. you don't have time to read all of it. you upload it to notebook LM. then you ask

05:43:13,040 --> 05:43:19,840
it questions: what are the main points? what are the key takeaways? can you explain this section in simple terms? and it gives

05:43:19,840 --> 05:43:26,220
you answers instantly. it's like having a personal assistant who's read everything for you. you can also create study guides.

05:43:26,220 --> 05:43:32,780
you can create frequently asked questions. you can create summaries. you can create briefing documents, all from one upload,

05:43:32,780 --> 05:43:40,100
all with one tool, all for free. this alone is worth using. but now let me show you where the magic really happens when you

05:43:40,100 --> 05:43:46,300
combine this with Perplexity AI. now if you don't know what Perplexity AI is, let me explain.

05:43:46,300 --> 05:43:53,840
Perplexity is like Google, but way better. it's a search engine powered by AI. you ask it a question, and instead of giving

05:43:53,840 --> 05:44:01,300
you 10 blue links, it gives you one perfect answer with sources, with citations, with everything you need. the best part?

05:44:01,300 --> 05:44:07,780
it's connected to the internet in real time, so it can find the newest information, the latest data, the most recent news.

05:44:07,780 --> 05:44:14,020
this is huge because most AI tools are stuck in the past. they only know what happened up to their training date. but Perplexity

05:44:14,020 --> 05:44:20,280
can search the web right now, today, this second, and give you the most up-to-date information possible. so here's how you

05:44:20,280 --> 05:44:26,400
combine these two tools together, and this is where things get really powerful. first you use Perplexity to research a topic.

05:44:26,400 --> 05:44:33,080
let's say you want to create content about AI automation. you go to Perplexity, you type in "what are the best AI automation

05:44:33,080 --> 05:44:41,060
tools in 2025," and Perplexity searches the entire internet. it reads hundreds of articles. it finds the best information,

05:44:41,060 --> 05:44:47,320
and it gives you a clean summary with sources. now here's the trick: you can tell Perplexity to write in a specific format.

05:44:47,320 --> 05:44:53,400
you can say, "write this as a blog post," or you can with sources or write this as a research report or write this as a step-by-step

05:44:53,400 --> 05:45:00,440
guide. and it will do exactly that in seconds, with perfect formatting, with proper structure, with everything you need. now

05:45:00,440 --> 05:45:06,760
before I show you the rest of this workflow, if you want to learn exactly how to use AI to scale your business and get more

05:45:06,760 --> 05:45:12,680
customers, you need to check out the AI Profit Boardroom. this is my community where we share the latest AI strategies that

05:45:12,680 --> 05:45:19,280
actually work, real case studies, real results. alright back to the workflow. now let me tell you about some other ways you

05:45:19,280 --> 05:45:26,100
can use this. you can turn your old blog posts into podcasts. if you've been blogging for years, you have tons of content

05:45:26,100 --> 05:45:32,320
sitting there. most people will never read it, but they might listen to it. so take those old posts, run them through notebook

05:45:32,320 --> 05:45:38,820
LM, turn them into audio. now you're repurposing content that you already created. you're getting more mileage out of work

05:45:38,820 --> 05:45:44,940
you already did. you can turn books into podcasts. if you've written a book, or if you have the rights to a book, you can

05:45:44,940 --> 05:45:52,160
upload chapters to notebook LM, create audio summaries, create discussion episodes. this is perfect for book marketing. people

05:45:52,160 --> 05:45:58,440
can listen to a summary before they buy, or they can listen to deep dives on specific chapters. you can turn research into

05:45:58,440 --> 05:46:05,360
content. if you're in a technical field, you probably read lots of research papers. most people don't have time for that,

05:46:05,360 --> 05:46:13,840
but you can take those papers, upload them to notebook LM, create a podcast that explains the findings in simple terms. now

05:46:13,840 --> 05:46:19,640
you're making complex information accessible. you're positioning yourself as an expert. you're providing value to your audience.

05:46:19,640 --> 05:46:26,780
you can turn competitor content into your own insights. now I'm not saying copy anyone, but you can use perplexity to research

05:46:26,780 --> 05:46:32,220
what your competitors are doing. see what topics they're covering. see what's working for them. then you can create your own

05:46:32,220 --> 05:46:42,820
unique take, your own perspective, your own content using the same workflow. research with perplexity, create with notebook

05:46:42,820 --> 05:46:49,300
LM. now let me address something. some people might say this is cheating. this is not real content creation. and to those

05:46:49,300 --> 05:46:56,500
people, I say you're wrong. you're dead wrong. this is the smartest way to create content in 2025. everyone is using AI now.

05:46:56,500 --> 05:47:03,320
every big creator, every big brand, every big company. if you're not using AI, you're falling behind. you're wasting time.

05:47:03,320 --> 05:47:09,480
you're working harder than you need to. the goal is not to replace creativity. the goal is to enhance it. the goal is to focus

05:47:09,480 --> 05:47:15,580
your time on the things that matter: strategy, unique insights, personal stories, your own experiences. let me handle the

05:47:15,580 --> 05:47:22,900
research. let me handle the formatting. let me handle the repetitive stuff. you focus on making it yours. you focus on adding

05:47:22,900 --> 05:47:28,520
value. you focus on connecting with your audience. and here's the thing: your audience doesn't care how you made the content.

05:47:28,520 --> 05:47:33,960
they care if it's valuable. they care if it helps them. they care if it's entertaining. they care if it solves their problems.

05:47:33,960 --> 05:47:39,760
if you can do that faster with AI, you should. if you can do that better with AI, you should. there's no medal for doing things

05:47:39,760 --> 05:47:47,740
the hard way. so let me give you the exact step-by-step process. step one: go to perplexity, research your topic, ask specific

05:47:47,740 --> 05:47:54,620
questions, get detailed answers. tell it to format the response how you want it. step two: copy that content, go to notebook

05:47:54,620 --> 05:48:01,140
lm create a new notebook, paste your content in or upload it as a file. step three: click on audio overview. let it generate

05:48:01,140 --> 05:48:07,260
your podcast. this takes a few minutes. go get a coffee, come back, it's done. step four: download the audio file. now you

05:48:07,260 --> 05:48:14,500
can upload it anywhere: youtube spotify your website, social media, everywhere. step five: take that same content and repurpose

05:48:14,500 --> 05:48:21,680
it. create a blog post, create social media posts, create email newsletters, create youtube video scripts. you're getting

05:48:21,680 --> 05:48:28,320
10 pieces of content from one research session. that's the power of this workflow. now i want to talk about quality because

05:48:28,320 --> 05:48:35,160
some people think i a content is low quality, and they're right if you use it wrong. if you just copy and paste without thinking,

05:48:35,160 --> 05:48:41,860
if you don't add your own voice, if you don't add your own insights, then yeah, it's going to be garbage. but if you use it

05:48:41,860 --> 05:48:48,420
as a starting point, if you use it as a research tool, if you use it to speed up your process, then the quality is incredible.

05:48:48,420 --> 05:48:55,120
the notebook lm podcasts sound better than most real podcasts. voices are clear, the pacing is good, the information is well

05:48:55,120 --> 05:49:01,320
structured. and because you can customize the source material, you can make sure the content is exactly what you want. you're

05:49:01,320 --> 05:49:09,240
in control. you're the director. ai is just the assistant. and with perplexity, the research is better than what most people

05:49:09,240 --> 05:49:15,700
can do manually because it's searching thousands of sources. it's reading hundreds of articles. it's finding the best information,

05:49:15,700 --> 05:49:22,220
and it's doing it in seconds. you'd have to spend hours to do the same research manually, maybe days. this way, you get better

05:49:22,220 --> 05:49:28,980
results faster. here's another pro tip: you can combine multiple sources in notebook lm you don't have to use just one document.

05:49:28,980 --> 05:49:36,080
you can upload five documents, 10 documents, 20 documents, and notebook lm will read all of them. it will find the connections.

05:49:36,080 --> 05:49:43,060
it will create a podcast that ties everything together. this is perfect for creating comprehensive guides, or deep dive episodes,

05:49:43,060 --> 05:49:49,260
or ultimate resource posts. now i want to show you one more advanced technique. you can use perplexity to analyze trends.

05:49:49,260 --> 05:49:55,600
you can ask it what topics are trending in my niche right now. what are people talking about on social media? what are the

05:49:55,600 --> 05:50:02,120
hot topics in the news? and they will tell you. then you can create content about those trending topics using the same workflow:

05:50:02,120 --> 05:50:10,760
research with perplexity, create with notebook lm and boom, you're riding the wave. you're getting more views, more engagement,

05:50:10,760 --> 05:50:18,360
more growth. this is exactly what big media companies do. they find trending topics, they create content fast, they publish

05:50:18,360 --> 05:50:24,100
it while people still care. and now you can do the same thing. you don't need a team of writers. you don't need a team of

05:50:24,100 --> 05:50:29,600
producers. you just need these two free tools and the knowledge of how to use them. let me tell you what this means for the

05:50:29,600 --> 05:50:35,860
future. content creation is changing. the old way was slow, expensive, hard. you had to write everything yourself. you have

05:50:35,860 --> 05:50:42,360
to record everything yourself. you have to edit everything yourself. it took forever. most people gave up. but now, the barriers

05:50:42,360 --> 05:50:51,980
are gone. anyone can create professional level content. anyone can compete with big brands. anyone can build an audience. this is the democratization of media.

05:50:51,980 --> 05:50:59,000
And if you want even more help with this, if you want to learn how to build a business around AI, if you want to connect with

05:50:59,000 --> 05:51:05,560
other people doing the same thing, then you need to check out the AI profit boardroom and if you want even more free resources

05:51:30,760 --> 05:51:36,580
Today, I'm going to show you how Gemini and notebook LM create SEO content that ranks in under an hour.

05:51:36,580 --> 05:51:42,880
I'm talking about content that used to take days. now it takes minutes with these two tools working together. and the crazy

05:51:42,880 --> 05:51:47,340
part: notebook LM discover finds all your research sources automatically.

05:51:47,340 --> 05:51:51,480
And Gemini canvas builds entire landing pages without touching code.

05:51:51,480 --> 05:51:59,140
This is how we're scaling past eight figures at my agency, and I'm going to give you the exact system, every single step, every single prompt.

05:51:59,140 --> 05:52:06,840
So, here's what most people get wrong about AI content. they use one tool, they paste it into WordPress, and they wonder why it doesn't rank.

05:52:06,840 --> 05:52:11,340
The reason is simple: they're missing the research layer. they're missing the optimization layer. they're missing the proof.

05:52:11,340 --> 05:52:13,820
the system I'm about to show you fixes all of that.

05:52:13,820 --> 05:52:19,800
You're going to use two tools together: notebook LM for research, Gemini for creation. and when these tools work together,

05:52:19,800 --> 05:52:27,100
magic happens. you get content backed by real sources, optimized for search engines, with landing pages that convert, all in one workflow.

05:52:27,100 --> 05:52:33,680
Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie agency.

05:52:33,680 --> 05:52:37,880
Let me walk you through the system step by step with the actual prompts you need to copy and paste.

05:52:37,880 --> 05:52:40,620
Step one is choosing your topic and finding keywords.

05:52:40,620 --> 05:52:43,000
You need a target before you start. don't guess.

05:52:43,000 --> 05:52:49,180
Go into Gemini and paste this prompt: list 10 short tail and long tail keyword ideas for [topic]. and then put your topic

05:52:49,180 --> 05:52:56,100
in brackets. prioritize search intent: transactional over informational over navigational. show search questions, hit enter.

05:52:56,100 --> 05:53:01,540
Gemini gives you a full keyword list with search intent mapped out and questions people are actually asking.

05:53:01,540 --> 05:53:04,620
Pick your main keyword, pick four supporting keywords, write them down.

05:53:04,620 --> 05:53:08,240
You'll use these throughout the entire process. Now, open notebook LM.

05:53:08,240 --> 05:53:14,700
This is where the magic starts. notebook LM has this feature called discover. it automatically finds the best sources on any topic.

05:53:14,700 --> 05:53:17,380
No more clicking through 10 pages of Google results.

05:53:17,380 --> 05:53:20,960
No more reading articles that don't help. Discover does the work for you.

05:53:20,960 --> 05:53:27,980
Here's the exact prompt: Create a research notebook about and then put your. [topic]. focus on SEO intent, target keyword

05:53:27,980 --> 05:53:31,040
and then put your primary keyword and four supporting keywords.

05:53:31,040 --> 05:53:37,180
Then write your four keywords. find authoritative sources, white papers, and blog posts. But you're not done yet.

05:53:37,180 --> 05:53:44,360
You need to actually pull in those sources. use the discover feature and paste this prompt: discover top sources for and put your [topic].

05:53:44,360 --> 05:53:50,280
Return up to 10 recommended articles, PDFs, and docs with a one line summary and a trust score from 1 to 10.

05:53:50,280 --> 05:53:59,280
Add the best six to this notebook. notebook LM will scan the web, Find articles, rate them, and add the best ones to your notebook. This happens in like two minutes.

05:53:59,280 --> 05:54:02,340
You just built a research library that would have taken hours manually.

05:54:02,340 --> 05:54:10,640
If you want our team to help you scale this even further, We're offering free SEO strategy sessions. and I mean actually free, no catch, no pressure.

05:54:32,220 --> 05:54:35,220
Now you have sources. next step is turning them into an outline.

05:54:35,220 --> 05:54:39,500
This is where notebook LM really dominates. It doesn't just store articles.

05:54:39,500 --> 05:54:42,820
It reads them, synthesizes them, pulls out what matters.

05:54:42,820 --> 05:54:50,000
Paste this prompt into into notebook LM: from the current notebook sources, create a research brief summary, five most important

05:54:50,000 --> 05:55:00,940
facts, Seven frequently asked user questions, and a suggested h1 plus seven h2 headings optimized for and then put your. [primary keyword]. Hit enter, wait 30 seconds.

05:55:00,940 --> 05:55:08,760
You get a complete brief with facts pulled from multiple sources, with questions people actually ask, with an SEO optimized outline. This is your blueprint.

05:55:08,760 --> 05:55:10,420
Everything you need to write is right here.

05:55:10,420 --> 05:55:16,560
Now, take that outline and go to Gemini. time to turn research into content. and here's the exact prompt you need: Write a

05:55:16,560 --> 05:55:25,660
1200 to 1500 word SEO article for and put your [primary keyword] using this outline. and then paste your h1 and h2s. use conversational

05:55:25,660 --> 05:55:33,140
tone, include a 20 word meta description, five key takeaways, and a short FAQ using the seven questions from the research

05:55:33,140 --> 05:55:38,420
brief. use internal linking anchor suggestions and give three suggested CTAs.

05:55:38,420 --> 05:55:45,400
Gemini pumps out a full draft in under a minute: a complete article with structure, with FAQs, with meta description, with CTAs.

05:55:45,400 --> 05:55:51,340
This is your first draft, and it's already better than most published content. but don't publish yet. You need to add proof.

05:55:51,340 --> 05:55:57,280
This is what separates content that ranks from content that disappears. go back to notebook LM with this prompt: for the Gemini

05:55:57,280 --> 05:56:05,480
draft, attach inline citations for claims for each h2. add one to two source quotes from this notebook with source links and

05:56:05,480 --> 05:56:11,820
timestamps or page numbers if available. notebook LM maps your sources to your content. It adds citations. It adds quotes.

05:56:11,820 --> 05:56:13,600
It shows exactly where each fact came from.

05:56:13,600 --> 05:56:17,920
This builds trust, and trust gets you rankings. Now, optimize for search engines.

05:56:17,920 --> 05:56:21,920
Take your article back to Gemini and paste this prompt: Optimize the article for SEO.

05:56:21,920 --> 05:56:24,480
Rewrite headings to include keywords where natural.

05:56:24,480 --> 05:56:26,880
Create an optimized meta title under 60 characters.

05:56:26,880 --> 05:56:35,920
Create schema.org JSON-LD for article with title, author, date, image, publisher. produce an alt tag list for images and list 10 semantic keywords to target.

05:56:46,480 --> 05:56:49,400
Gemini does it all. but content needs more than text.

05:56:49,400 --> 05:56:54,340
It needs visuals, social posts, thumbnails, and Gemini creates all of that.

05:56:54,340 --> 05:57:00,720
Here's the prompt: generate five thumbnail headline options that are short, six social captions for Twitter, six LinkedIn

05:57:00,720 --> 05:57:07,860
post captions, and a script for a 30 second video teaser. also output three captioned screenshots suggestions for the article.

05:57:07,860 --> 05:57:17,580
one prompt, you get everything you need to promote across every platform: headlines for YouTube, captions for social, screenshot ideas, all done. Now, here's where it gets wild.

05:57:17,580 --> 05:57:25,260
Gemini canvas, this tool builds actual working websites from prompts. no code, no developers, just describe what you want. canvas builds it.

05:57:25,260 --> 05:57:32,660
Paste this prompt into Gemini canvas: create a responsive single page landing site for this article. include hero with h1,

05:57:32,660 --> 05:57:40,200

You can see it live, edit it with more prompts, export the code, host it anywhere.

05:57:57,180 --> 05:58:01,760
You just built a professional landing page in five minutes that would have cost hundreds of dollars.

05:58:01,760 --> 05:58:06,900
But there's one more critical step: fact checking. you need to verify everything before you publish.

05:58:06,900 --> 05:58:13,900
Go to notebook lm with this prompt: check the final article and landing page content against notebook sources. flag any unsupported

05:58:13,900 --> 05:58:21,780
claims And suggest corrections. notebook lm scans your content, compares it to your sources, catches mistakes, Suggests fixes.

this update to notebook lm, and it's honestly wild. they added something called video overviews with nano banana visuals.

05:59:55,490 --> 06:00:01,950
yeah that's the real name, nano banana. i know it sounds like a fruit, but it's actually google's image model that makes art

from your notes. here's what happened. notebook lm used to just make audio podcasts from your docs. now it makes full videos,

06:00:46,830 --> 06:00:56,910
lm reads it. then it generates a video overview. that means a short slideshow with a. it's not robotic; it's actually pretty

natural. now here's where it gets crazy. you get six visual styles to pick from: watercolor, papercraft, anime, whiteboard,

06:01:03,570 --> 06:01:11,090
retro print, and heritage. each one has a different vibe. watercolor looks soft and artsy. papercraft looks like cut paper

06:02:22,250 --> 06:02:28,910
description. join now. all right, let's keep going. so why does this matter? because most people hate turning notes into videos.

06:02:28,910 --> 06:02:36,370
it's boring. it takes forever. you got to write a script. you got to find images. you got to record audio. you got to edit.

06:02:36,370 --> 06:02:43,110
notebook lm does all of that in one shot. you upload your notes and get a finished video in minutes. now let me tell you how

06:02:43,110 --> 06:02:50,070
to actually use this thing. first you open notebook lm. it's free. you don't need to; you just need a google account. then

06:02:50,070 --> 06:02:56,170
you make a new notebook or open one you already have. you add sources. that could be a pdf, a word doc, a google doc, a web

06:02:56,170 --> 06:03:02,750
page, a youtube video, anything with text or info. once your sources are in, you hit the video overview button. it's right

06:03:02,750 --> 06:03:09,010
there in the interface. then you pick your format, brief or explainer. then you pick your style, one of those six nano banana

06:03:09,010 --> 06:03:15,930
styles i mentioned. then you hit generate. that's it. you wait like a minute or two. you got a video. the video plays right

06:03:15,930 --> 06:03:22,850
in the app. it's got narration. it's got slides. it's got visuals pulled from your sources. if your pdf had a chart, it might

06:03:22,850 --> 06:03:29,150
show that chart. if your doc had a quote, it might highlight that quote on screen. it's contextual. it's not random stock

06:03:29,150 --> 06:03:35,470
art. it's made from your actual content. now here's where this gets insane for youtube creators. you can use the brief format

06:03:35,470 --> 06:03:41,730
to pump out shorts. think about it. you got a long blog post. you throw it in notebook lm. you generate a brief. you get a

06:03:41,730 --> 06:03:48,670
30 second narrated video with cool visuals. you post it, done. you just made a short in two minutes. or you use the explainer

06:03:48,670 --> 06:03:54,750
format for your main channel videos. you got course notes. you got research. you got a bunch of pdfs. you throw them all in.

06:03:54,750 --> 06:04:00,710
you generate an explainer. you get a five minute script with visuals. now you got a backbone for your video. you can record

06:04:00,710 --> 06:04:07,470
over it. you can use the visuals as b-roll. you can even just re-record the script in your own voice and use their slides

06:04:07,470 --> 06:04:14,310
and the visuals make great thumbnails. you generate a video in the anime style. you screenshot one of the slides. you add

06:04:14,310 --> 06:04:21,570
some text, boom, thumbnail. you didn't need canva. you didn't need a designer. notebook lm gave you the art. so you pick the

06:04:21,570 --> 06:04:27,210
style that matches your vibe. that's the beauty of this. you're not locked into one look. you can make the same video in six

06:04:27,210 --> 06:04:33,750
different styles and test which one performs better. you can a b test your thumbnails. you can a b test your shorts. you can

06:04:33,750 --> 06:04:39,630
see what your audience likes. now let me talk about how to actually export this stuff. when you generate a video overview,

06:04:39,630 --> 06:04:46,050
it plays in the app. you can record your screen. you can use obs or quick time or whatever screen recorder you got. you just

06:04:46,050 --> 06:04:52,430
hit record and play the video. now you got the file. or you can export the frames. you can screenshot the slides. you can

06:04:52,430 --> 06:04:59,050
pull those images out and use them as b-roll. you can drop them into premiere or final cut or cap cut. you can add your own

06:04:59,050 --> 06:05:06,710
voiceover. you can add music. you can customize it however you want. the narration is generated by notebook lm. it's ai voices.

06:05:06,710 --> 06:05:13,050
they sound like two people having a conversation. it's pretty natural. but if you want to use your own voice, you just record

06:05:13,050 --> 06:05:19,230
over it. you use the script that notebook lm wrote. you read it yourself. now it's your voice with their visuals. that's a

06:05:19,230 --> 06:05:26,170
killer combo. now let me talk about the rollout because this isn't available everywhere right now. it's rolling out on desktop

06:05:26,170 --> 06:05:33,170
first. it's in english first. google said they're expanding to more languages and mobile soon. so if you're not seeing it

06:05:33,170 --> 06:05:40,150
yet, check back in a few days. it's coming. you need a google account. you need to go to notebook lm. that's at notebooklm.google.com.

06:05:40,150 --> 06:05:45,610
it's free. you don't need google one. you don't need to pay for anything. you just sign in and start using it. now let me

06:05:45,610 --> 06:05:52,010
talk about the legal side. if you use notebook lm to make videos, make sure you or have rights to the source material. don't

06:05:52,010 --> 06:05:57,810
throw in someone else's copyrighted pdf and make a video from it. that's not cool. that could get you in trouble. use your

06:05:57,810 --> 06:06:04,870
own content. use public domain content. use content you have permission to use. also if you're showing user data or private

06:06:04,870 --> 06:06:11,970
info in your videos, blur it or anonymize it. don't show sensitive stuff. protect people's privacy and check google's terms.

06:06:11,970 --> 06:06:18,770
if you plan to rehost or sell notebook lm content, google might have rules about commercial use. read the terms. stay safe.

06:06:18,770 --> 06:06:25,570
all right, so here's what you need to do right now. go to notebook lm. make a notebook. add some sources. generate a video

06:07:50,370 --> 06:07:58,050
it. all right, see you in the next one. these notebook lm hacks are insane. today i'm going to show you notebook lm hacks

06:07:58,050 --> 06:08:04,110
that will blow your mind. these are brand new tricks that nobody's talking about yet. i'm going to show you how to use notebook

06:08:04,110 --> 06:08:11,150
lm in ways google never intended. this stuff is so powerful. it's basically unfair. by the end of this video, you'll be using

06:08:11,150 --> 06:08:18,190
ai like a total pro, and the best part is completely free. all right, let's talk about notebook lm. this tool is crazy. most

06:08:18,190 --> 06:08:24,850
people have no idea what it can actually do. they think it's just another ai chatbot. wrong notebook lm is completely different

06:08:24,850 --> 06:08:31,710
from chat gpt or claude. it's better in a lot of ways, and i'm going to show you exactly why. but first, let me explain what

06:08:31,710 --> 06:08:39,530
notebook lm actually is. it's a tool made by google that lets you upload your own files. then it creates an ai that knows

06:08:39,530 --> 06:08:46,830
everything about those files. you can upload pdfs, documents, websites, videos, audio files, pretty much anything. then you

06:08:46,830 --> 06:08:53,310
can ask it questions about all that content. now here's what makes notebook lm different. when you use chat gpt, is trained

06:08:53,310 --> 06:08:58,430
on general knowledge. it knows a lot about everything, but it doesn't know anything specific about your business. notebook

06:08:58,430 --> 06:09:04,590
lm is the opposite. you feed it your documents, then it becomes an expert on your stuff. hey if we haven't met already, i'm

06:09:04,590 --> 06:09:12,970
the digital avatar of julian goldie, ceo of seo agency goldie agency. whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers,

06:09:12,970 --> 06:09:19,390
i'm here to help you get the latest ai updates. i'm going to show you the real power moves, the hacks that actually matter,

06:09:19,390 --> 06:09:25,850
the stuff that will save you hours every single day. let's start with hack number one. this one alone is worth the entire

06:09:25,850 --> 06:09:33,270
video. you can turn any content into a. i don't mean a regular podcast. i mean a full conversation between two people. they

06:09:33,270 --> 06:09:39,050
talk about your content like they're on a radio show. they ask each other questions. they explain complex ideas in simple

06:09:39,050 --> 06:09:45,290
terms. it sounds completely real. here's how you do it. upload your content to notebook lm. could be a blog post, a pdf, a

06:09:45,290 --> 06:09:51,770
research paper, anything. then click on the audio overview button. that's it. notebook lm will create a whole podcast episode

06:09:51,770 --> 06:09:59,170
about your content. two ai hosts talking about your stuff. the crazy part is how good it sounds. these aren't robot voices.

06:09:59,170 --> 06:10:05,170
they sound like real people having a real conversation. and here's another way to use this. let's say you write a blog post.

06:10:05,170 --> 06:10:14,430
you spend hours on it, but most people won't read it. they're too busy. so turn your blog posts into a podcast. upload it

06:10:14,430 --> 06:10:23,230
to notebook lm. generate the audio. now you have a. put it on spotify. suddenly your written content reaches a whole new audience.

06:10:23,230 --> 06:10:30,130
hack number two is about customizing those podcasts. most people don't know you can do this. you can actually tell notebook

06:10:30,130 --> 06:10:37,310
lm what to focus on. let's say you upload a long document about marketing, but you only care about the seo parts. you can

06:10:37,310 --> 06:10:43,670
tell notebook lm to focus on seo. then the podcast will spend most of the time talking about that. here's how. before you

06:10:43,670 --> 06:10:50,510
generate the audio, look for the customize button. it's right next to the audio overview button. click that. then type in

06:10:50,510 --> 06:10:57,350
what you want the host to focus on. be specific. don't just say focus on the important parts. say focus on the three main

06:10:57,350 --> 06:11:03,510
seo strategies discussed in this document. the more specific you are, the better the results. you can also tell it to make

06:11:03,510 --> 06:11:10,250
the podcast shorter or longer. let's say the default podcast is 20 minutes, but you only have a 10 minute drive. tell it to

06:11:10,250 --> 06:11:16,370
make a 10 minute version. it will condense everything, focus on the most important points. now let's talk about hack number

06:11:16,370 --> 06:11:22,250
three. this one is for people who work with teams. you can use notebook lm as a shared knowledge base. here's the problem.

06:11:22,250 --> 06:11:28,150
most teams have someone creates a document, they share it with the team, nobody reads it. then people keep asking the same

06:11:28,150 --> 06:11:34,650
questions over and over. it wastes so much time. notebook lm solves this. upload all your company documents to a notebook

06:11:34,650 --> 06:11:41,650
lm project. training materials, process docs, meeting notes, everything. then share that project with your team. now anyone

06:11:41,650 --> 06:11:47,730
can ask questions and get instant answers. no more searching through 50 different google docs. the ai knows everything, and

06:11:47,730 --> 06:11:55,430
it cites its sources. all right, before i show you the next hack, i need to tell you something important. if you want to actually

06:11:55,430 --> 06:12:04,610
scale your business with ai, you need to join the ai profit boardroom. this is where i share all my best ai strategies. inside

06:12:04,610 --> 06:12:11,970
you'll get access to proven ai automations and a community of entrepreneurs who are actually doing this stuff, not just talking

06:12:11,970 --> 06:12:18,810
about it. link is in the description. now let's keep going. hack number four is about research. this is huge. if you're a

06:12:18,810 --> 06:12:25,810
student or you create content, you can upload multiple sources to notebook lm. then ask it to compare them or find contradictions

06:12:25,810 --> 06:12:35,470
or synthesize them into a single argument. you can also use this for fact checking. let's say you find three or four other

06:12:35,470 --> 06:12:41,650
sources on the topic. upload them all to notebook lm. ask if they all agree. now you know which information is reliable. hack

06:12:41,650 --> 06:12:48,650
number five is for anyone who does interviews or podcasts. you can upload audio or video files to notebook lm. then it transcribes

06:12:48,650 --> 06:12:54,930
them automatically, and you can ask questions about the content. this is a game changer for repurposing content. let's say

06:12:54,930 --> 06:13:02,310
you do a one hour podcast interview. upload the audio to notebook lm. then ask it for the 10 quotes or the main takeaways.

06:13:02,310 --> 06:13:08,790
now you have content for social media, for email newsletters, for blog posts, all from one interview. but here's where it

06:13:08,790 --> 06:13:14,850
gets really powerful. you can ask notebook lm to find specific moments in the video. let's say you did a two-hour interview.

06:13:14,850 --> 06:13:22,150
you vaguely remember talking about email marketing, but you don't remember when. just ask notebook lm when did we talk about

06:13:22,150 --> 06:13:28,170
email marketing. it will tell you the exact time stamp. hack number six is about learning new skills. you can use notebook

06:13:28,170 --> 06:13:34,550
lm as a personal tutor. upload a book or course materials. then ask it to quiz you or explain concepts in different ways or

06:13:34,550 --> 06:13:40,390
give you examples. here's why this works so well. most people learn by reading once and hoping it sticks. that's terrible

06:13:40,390 --> 06:13:46,390
for retention. you need to engage with the material. ask questions. test yourself. notebook lm makes this easy. you can also

06:13:46,390 --> 06:13:53,150
ask it to explain things like you're five years old or give you analogies. the ai will adapt its explanation to match what

06:13:53,150 --> 06:13:59,350
you need. if you don't understand something, just keep asking questions. hack number seven is for people who hate meetings.

06:13:59,350 --> 06:14:06,770
you can record meetings and upload them to notebook lm. then ask it for action items or decisions that were made or who's

06:14:06,770 --> 06:14:13,230
responsible for what. no more taking notes during meetings. just record it, upload it, ask the ai. i do this for every client

06:14:13,230 --> 06:14:20,290
call. now after the call, i upload the recording, ask notebook lm what the client wants, what we agreed to deliver, what the

06:14:20,290 --> 06:14:26,070
timeline is. then i send that summary to my team. everyone knows exactly what to do, and i didn't have to spend 30 minutes

06:14:26,070 --> 06:14:32,970
writing meeting notes. you can also use this to settle arguments. let's say two people remember a meeting differently. just

04:00:06,350 --> 07:45:00,520
Just ask notebook lm what actually happened. it will tell you exactly what was said. hack number eight is about combining

07:45:00,520 --> 07:45:08,640
notebook lm with other ai tools. this is where things get really powerful. you can use notebook lm to research a topic, then

07:45:08,640 --> 07:45:15,840
copy that research into chat gpt or claude and tell them to write something. here's another combo: use notebook lm to analyze

07:45:15,840 --> 07:45:22,460
customer feedback. upload all your customer reviews, all your support tickets. ask it, what are the top three complaints?

07:45:22,460 --> 07:45:31,799
what do customers love most? then take that information to chat gpt tell it to write product updates or marketing copy. now

07:45:31,799 --> 07:45:38,999
everything you create is based on real customer data. hack number nine is about organizing your ideas. you can upload random

07:45:38,999 --> 07:45:45,619
notes and thoughts to notebook lm then ask it to organize them or find patterns or turn them into an outline. this is perfect

07:45:45,619 --> 07:45:51,819
for people who have a million ideas but can't organize them. i keep a notes app on my phone. whenever i have an idea, i write

07:45:51,819 --> 07:45:58,179
it down. but then i have hundreds of random notes. now i upload them all to notebook lm ask it to group similar ideas together

07:45:58,179 --> 07:46:05,539
or find the best ideas in the list. suddenly all those random thoughts become actionable. you can also use this for brainstorming.

07:46:05,539 --> 07:46:12,339
let's say you're trying to come up with content ideas. you write down 20 random thoughts, upload them to notebook lm ask it

07:46:12,339 --> 07:46:19,679
which ideas have the most potential or how you could combine ideas to create something better. hack number 10 is the most

07:46:19,679 --> 07:46:25,779
advanced one. you can use notebook lm to create standard operating procedures. this is huge for business owners. if you want

07:46:25,779 --> 07:46:32,419
