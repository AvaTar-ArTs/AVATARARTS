1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Notebook LM is the most slept on AI tool of the year, and it's not even close.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,300
While everyone's arguing about ChatGPT vs Claude, smart people are using this to build entire

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
business systems in under an hour.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,440
I'm talking full podcast episodes generated from your notes.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,040
Complete research reports from messy documents.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,820
Entire client onboarding systems that run themselves.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,520
Here's what most people don't understand.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,640
Notebook LM isn't just another chatbot, it's a complete automation engine that most people are using completely wrong.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,520
They're asking it basic questions like it's ChatGPT.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,560
That's like buying a Ferrari and driving it in first gear.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,240
What Notebook LM actually does is turn your messy knowledge into automated systems that work

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
for you while you sleep.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,600
I'm going to show you exactly how we use this to automate client research, create training materials,

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,220
and build content systems that pump out value every single day.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,280
We're talking about uploading our entire course library, letting Notebook LM study it, then

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,380
creating custom onboarding sequences for new members in literally 5 minutes.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,900
That used to take us hours, now it's automated.

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,120
And the craziest part, this tool is free.

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,100
Google built this thing, dropped it quietly, and most people completely missed it.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,180
But the smart operators, they're already 10 steps ahead.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,620
They're building podcast networks without recording, creating complete course curriculums from

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,420
raw notes, turning client calls into training documentation automatically.

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,160
So here's what we're covering today.

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,480
First, the complete setup from scratch, no assumptions.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm showing you exactly how to get started, even if you've never touched this tool before.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,740
Then we're going into the advanced features that nobody talks about.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,900
The source management system, the citation tracking, the audio overview feature that literally

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,940
creates podcast episodes from your documents.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:53,160
Then we're hitting automation strategies, how to connect use cases.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm showing you exactly what we do at the AI Profit Boardroom, how we use this to grow our community,

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,640
how we automate member support, how we create new training content faster than anyone else in the space. This isn't theory.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,060
This is what's actually working right now, and buckle up because this is going to move fast.

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Every single second of this video is packed with value. Let's get into it.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,640
Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency, Goldie Agency.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,740
Whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to help you get the latest AI updates.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,560
Julian Goldie reads every comment, so make sure you comment below and let me know what you think.

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,940
Let's start with the first update, export notes and reports anywhere. So here's what changed.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,220
You know how you'd create notes or study guides or briefing docs inside Notebook LM?

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,740
Now you can export them.

40
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,660
Just go to your studio panel, find whatever you saved, click the three dots next to it, then choose export.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,240
You can send it to Google Docs or Google Sheets.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
And here's the cool part.

43
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,320
If your content has tables in it, Notebook LM is smart enough to send it straight to Sheets.

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,400
So you get editable tables right away, no copying and pasting, no reformatting, just instant export. Why does this matter?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,720
Because Notebook LM is now a real workspace tool.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,480
Before this update, everything lived inside Notebook LM.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,800
You couldn't really share it or edit it with your team. Now you can.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,220
You create a study guide in Notebook LM, export it to Docs and share it with your study group.

49
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,860
You make a briefing doc, export it to Sheets, and your whole team can edit it.

50
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,860
This makes Notebook LM way more powerful for collaboration.

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,000
Students can use this, researchers can use this, teams can use this.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,440
It's not just a viewer anymore, it's a real tool that fits into your workflow.

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,780
And honestly, this is what people have been asking for.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,100
The ability to take what you build in Notebook LM and actually use it somewhere else.

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,780
Now you can export to Docs if you want to write more, export to Sheets if you want to track data. It's that simple.

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,380
And it works with everything you create in the studio panel, notes, study guides, reports, all of it.

57
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,960
One click and it's in your Google Drive ready to go.

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760
But the export feature is just the warm-up.

59
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,760
The second update is the real game changer. Data tables.

60
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,140
This is the insane part.

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,620
Notebook LM can now turn your messy content into structured tables automatically.

62
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,340
Like you upload a meeting transcript or a research paper or a bunch of notes.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,220
Then you tell Notebook LM to make a data table and it analyzes everything and creates a clean organized table for you.

64
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,260
No manual work, the AI does it all. Here's how it works.

65
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,100
You go into Notebook LM, you select the sources you want to use, then you ask it to create a data table.

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,180
Notebook LM reads through everything, it finds the key info, it organizes it into rows and columns,

67
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,720
and boom, you have a table.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Then you can export that table straight into Google Sheets.

69
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,100
So now you have editable data you can analyze, sort, filter, whatever you need.

70
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,380
And honestly, if you want to stay ahead with tools like Notebook LM and automate more of your

71
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,040
business with AI, you need to join the AI Profit Bordering Lab.

72
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,200
This is where I share the exact systems and automations we use to scale our agency.

73
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,260
You learn how to use tools like Notebook LM to organize your research, automate your workflows,

74
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,880
and save hundreds of hours.

75
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,260
We've got members who are using AI to cut their workload in half.

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,280
If you want to scale your business, get more customers, and save time with AI automation, the

77
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,420
AI Profit Boardroom is the place to be.

78
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,780
Link is in the description.

79
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,300
Let me give you some use cases because this is where it gets really powerful.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
Imagine you have a meeting transcript.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,620
Lots of ideas, lots of action items, but it's all scattered.

82
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,140
You throw it into Notebook LM, ask it to create a data table, and now you have a clean table

83
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,640
with every action item, who's responsible, and the deadline done.

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Or let's say you're doing competitive research.

85
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
You have notes on five different competitors.

86
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,260
You ask Notebook LM to make a table comparing them side by side, features, pricing, target audience, all laid out.

87
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Or you're a student studying for exams.

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,880
You have lecture notes from 10 different classes.

89
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,480
You ask Notebook LM to create a study table with all the key concepts, definitions, and examples,

90
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,320
instant study guide, or you're planning a project.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,100
You have brainstorming notes, timelines, team assignments, all mixed together.

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,680
You ask Notebook LM to turn it into a project planning chart.

93
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,500
Everything organized by task, person, and deadline.

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,140
You see where I'm going with this.

95
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,140
Data tables save you hours of manual work.

96
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,420
Instead of reading through everything and typing it into a spreadsheet yourself, Notebook LM does it for you. And it's fast.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
We're talking minutes, not hours. Now here's the thing.

98
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
Data tables are live right now for pro and ultra users.

99
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,320
If you're on the free plan, it's coming soon.

100
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
Google said they're rolling it out to everyone.

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,500
So if you don't see it yet, just wait a bit.

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,560
But if you have pro or ultra, go try it right now.

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,560
Upload some content, ask for a data table, see what it creates.

104
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,660
I think you're going to be blown away by how good it is.

105
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,240
And look, this is a massive productivity boost.

106
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,840
You're not spending hours organizing data anymore.

107
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,840
You're not copying and pasting into spreadsheets. You're not reformatting tables.

108
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,420
Notebook LM handles all of that.

109
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,840
You just tell it what you need and it builds it.

110
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,200
This is perfect for students who need to organize study material.

111
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,320
This is perfect for teams who need to track tasks and projects.

112
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,120
This is perfect for researchers who need to compare data.

113
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,760
This is perfect for anyone who works with information.

114
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,040
All right, so those are the two big export anywhere and AI generated tables.

115
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
But here's what you need to know.

116
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,940
These updates are part of a bigger trend.

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,860
Google is turning Notebook LM into a serious tool.

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,100
It's not just a simple note taker anymore.

119
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,260
They've been adding features like crazy.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,180
They added an enhanced studio panel where you can create multiple outputs.

121
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,960
They added chat history that saves across sessions.

122
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,900
They're even hinting at deeper integration with Gemini.

123
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,240
So Notebook LM is evolving fast.

124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,560
Now, let me give you some tips for actually using these new features. First, the export feature. Use it to collaborate.

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,980
Don't keep everything locked inside Notebook LM.

126
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,220
Export your notes to docs and share them with your team.

127
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,140
Export your tables to sheets and let people add to them.

128
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,000
This makes Notebook LM a team tool, not just a solo tool.

129
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,760
Second, the data tables feature.

130
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,880
Think about what you want before you ask Notebook LM to create a table.

131
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,500
If you want a comparison table, make sure your sources have comparison data.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,040
If you want an action item table, make sure your sources mention tasks and deadlines.

133
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,080
The better your input, the better your output.

134
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,200
Third, experiment with different types of content.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,040
Try uploading meeting notes and creating task tables.

136
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,580
Try uploading research papers and creating fact tables.

137
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Try uploading study material and creating revision tables.

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,100
See what works best for your workflow.

139
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,600
And fourth, remember you can export everything.

140
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,000
Once you create a table in Notebook LM, export it to sheets.

141
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,420
Then you can filter it, sort it, add formulas, whatever you need.

142
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,040
The table in Notebook LM is just a starting point.

143
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,300
The real power comes when you export it and work with it in sheets.

144
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,740
We're going to see even more powerful features, deeper research capabilities, be better video

145
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,360
overview tools, full integration with Gemini so you can export to Gemini and keep working there.

146
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,760
Google is clearly investing in Notebook LM.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,460
They're adding features fast and they're listening to what users want.

148
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,520
So if you're not using Notebook LM yet, now is the time to start.

149
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,020
These new updates make it way more useful.

150
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,220
So go try it, see what you can build, and let me know in the comments what tables you create.

151
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,080
I want to hear how you're using this.

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,260

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Links in the comments and description.

163
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,580
You'll get all the video notes from there, plus access to our community of 38,000 members who

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,820

165
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
Notebook LM has some huge updates recently.

166
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,500
These are the new free updates from Notebook LM that we're going to run through today.

167
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,980
You get access to notebooklm.google and I'm going to run you through some of the latest updates.

168
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,680
So you can now, for example, turn one single document into six different things.

169
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,640
Video, slide decks, infographic, research reports, flashcards, quizzes, etc.

170
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,900
And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works.

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,400
We're testing it live right now.

172
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm going to upload one PDF to show you how fast it spits out a video, pitch deck, infographic, and more.

173
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,820
And this is the kind of stuff that used to take a full team. Designers, editors, researchers.

174
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,400
Now you can do it all with one click.

175
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,660
So if we get straight into this, you can see an example of Notebook LM here.

176
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,660
If you want to get started, you can just start running an example over here, load your sources,

177
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,980
you can do deep research.

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,820
So for example, let's say you've got an interesting example, right?

179
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,360
So for me, I want to learn more ways to grow my school community, right?

180
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,420
Now how can I do that?

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,720
What I can actually do is here is I can click on deep research and then I can type in what I

182
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
want to learn about, right?

183
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,280
So for example, like getting more customers on the school.

184
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,520
And from here, we can start doing deep research automatically with Notebook LM and you'll actually

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,300
search many different sources on the web, across the web to start building with this. All right.

186
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
If you have any questions as we go along, feel free to ask.

187
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,280
Crystal says, love Notebook LM. Absolutely, I do too.

188
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,160
Crystal said, think tuning fell asleep, man works too hard.

189
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,260
And you can see an example here of how we're loading in that deep research.

190
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,200
I've actually plugged in a bunch of examples here.

191
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,020
And if you want to generate, for example, like a podcast or a video, if you wanted to generate

192
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,220
flashcards, quizzes, infographics, slide decks, data tables, or mind maps, we can do that all

193
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,860
right here on the right hand side, right?

194
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,300
So it's automatically loading it, which is super powerful and it's free and it's easy to use.

195
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,380
It doesn't take long at all.

196
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,700
And you can start doing this without much effort at all. All right.

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,020
Now I want to show you a bunch of practical examples in a minute.

198
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
You can see how easy this is to get done.

199
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,300
So let's keep going through now.

200
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,980
Whilst waiting for these to load, I'm going to actually load up a new notebook in the background.

201
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,440
As you can see, we're going to run through some examples to test. All right.

202
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,180
So the first one, I'm actually going to create a new notebook here and I'm going to upload some

203
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,680
details about the AI Profit Boarding.

204
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
So we'll copy the text.

205
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
We'll go to the AI Profit Boarding.

206
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm actually just going to load the sales page.

207
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,080
And I'm going to plug that into the chat sources. Here we go. All right.

208
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
We'll insert that information into the sources over here.

209
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,220
And now let's create a notebook with the information from the AI Profit Boarding.

210
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,560
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to video overview to generate kind of like a course

211
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,540
trailer with AI narration explaining what members will learn.

212
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,260
But the difference here is I'm going to switch this to explainer.

213
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,920
We're actually going to change that to, we can change the visual style to like the classic.

214
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:32,520
And then I'm just going to say here create a short trailer teasing my course, plus selling the benefits of it.

215
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,160
Or create a short trailer teasing my community.

216
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,260
Then we can hit generate.

217
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
And that will actually generate a video view.

218
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,240
It's basically like a video sales letter for our community. Right.

219
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,680
And you see how easy and quick this is to do. All right. Data tables as well.

220
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,180
Data tables is another option.

221
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,600
And I pulled out, let's see, so Lalith says I pulled out a Harvard level research from Knight Sources. I can immediately publish.

222
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,100
And wow, that's pretty All right. Dr.

223
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,520
David says Notebook LM is really the best AI tool out there, especially since it became integrated into Gemini. Yeah, I would agree.

224
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
And then says shout out from India Julian.

225
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,240
I've been following you since a little more than a month and love all your videos. Appreciate that man. Greetings to you too. All right.

226
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,000
So you see here how it's beginning to generate the video overview using the information that

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,520
we've plugged in, which is just a sales page for my community. Right.

228
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,260
So that's one example of how you can use this.

229
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,120
You can use it to generate like really quick video sales letters, et cetera.

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,460
What we can also do, this is interesting too, is we can actually upload like a competitor's

231
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,160
sales page and get a video breakdown of their offer structure.

232
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,920
Let me show you exactly how that works. Right.

233
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,660
So if we go on create new over here, we're going to go to copy text.

234
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,380
And obviously I'm not going to take my competitor's page on a live stream, but I will take my

235
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,300
own and we can use it as an example. Right.

236
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,920
So I can take that and then we can go to import, paste the text in there.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,780
Or what you can do is you can just actually add it as a source, as a website source.

238
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,760
You could actually take the website here, paste in the URL like that, hit insert.

239
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,720
Oh yeah, it can import, go high level pages, which is pretty good. All right.

240
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,140
And now we can say, okay, reverse engineer my competitor's offer.

241
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,580
And we'll put that in the chat.

242
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,760
But before I actually do that, what we're going to do over here is go to the settings.

243
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm going to go to custom.

244
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,040
Yeah, we'll go to settings and then custom here.

245
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,820
You can actually explain the role, right?

246
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:19,360
So you could say, okay, you are a competitor analyst analyzing and breaking down my competitor's marketing strategies. All right. We'll disable now.

247
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,160
And then we're going to click on reverse engineer my competitor's offer.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,100
And basically you can use this as kind of like a competitor analysis.

249
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,300
They can quickly analyze your competitors, find different resources, find different use cases,

250
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,120
and then go from there.

251
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:38,500
Mim says, love your videos on X and Facebook. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. And Alkeem says, greatness. That's awesome. Thank you.

252
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,280
So you see here, for example, based on the intelligence gathered from Cordy's agency's landing

253
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,620
page materials, I've reverse engineered their marketing strategy and offer structure.

254
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,940
It's compared to analysis view.

255
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,380
This is a highly productized SEO model that relies heavily on AI automation, blah, blah, blah. Right.

256
00:14:52,460 --> 00:15:01,260
And this explains what it does, the hook and risk reversal, pricing psychology, the fulfillment mechanism, the competitive vulnerabilities. Right. And everything else.

257
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,840
And so it actually talks about ways that you can make the offer better.

258
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:14,140
And then you can say, okay, now create a sales page with a better offer than my competitors, right. It direct response style.

259
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,140
And what I actually do is reverse engineer my competitors, break down their offer.

260
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,820
And then from there, I actually create like a better sales page that we could use to create something more interesting.

261
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,140
And that's constructing the offer.

262
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
And we're good to go in here.

263
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,100
And you can see it's now create a headline.

264
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,560
The offer is actually used the offer from our competitors, as you can see here, but it's made it slightly more compelling.

265
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,160
And then you can see the whole sales page broken down, right.

266
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,660
It's so easy to start doing that.

267
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,620
And so just to recap here, what have we done?

268
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,400
We've automated deep research and pulled in a bunch of sources to fix any business problems that we have.

269
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,800
We've also loaded in a competitor page into a notebook and then reverse engineer their offer.

270
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,120
Also create a better sales page than the original one with a better offer based on reverse engineering our competitors page, right. Super simple and easy.

271
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,240
You can do all of this for free.

272
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,480
On top of that, what we've also done is we actually created flashcards, quizzes, an infographic,

273
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,480
a podcast, etc. on all the stuff that we loaded into it, right.

274
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,720
So you can actually create six or eight different automations for free directly inside notebook

275
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,620
LM, as you can see.

276
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,420
So if you click on this infographic here, you see that we've generated an infographic automatically

277
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,100
based on the information we loaded into notebook, right.

278
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,780
Super powerful, really easy to do.

279
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,540
And it doesn't take long at all, right.

280
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,960
We've literally done that in less than 10 minutes. It's ridiculously easy. All right.

281
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,780
Let me talk about the old way versus new way, right.

282
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,640
So for creating videos, the old way was like hire a video editor, wait days, it'd be expensive

283
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,860
to hire them and you go back and forth with revisions.

284
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,240
The new way is you upload your document, click a button and get video of AI narration in minutes

285
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,040
for free using notebook LM, as you can see today.

286
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,340
It's generating that video and the slide deck over there.

287
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,220
With slide decks, the old way was open PowerPoint, spend hours formatting for images, try to

288
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,840
make it look good, give up and use ugly slides anyway, right.

289
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,180
The new way is upload your PDF notes, notebook LM builds a deck for you, graphs, diagrams and visuals included.

290
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,760
The old way of infographics, you would like hire a designer on Fiverr, wait three to five days. It could be expensive.

291
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,140
Hope they understand what you want.

292
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,860
The new way is like you can upload any content for free into notebook, get a vertical horizontal infographic instantly.

293
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,420
And it's perfect for posting on LinkedIn or Instagram or TikTok, right.

294
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,720
You see an example of that infographic over here. Let's pull it up. There you go. Deep research.

295
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:23,540
The old way was like you have 47 browser tabs open, you spend all day reading, you try to notebook

296
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,240
LM to research topic, get a full report with over 30 sources synthesized, and then turn that

297
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,220
report into slides for a video of one more click.

298
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,280
The old way of training your team was like you would write long SOPs, hope your team reads them,

299
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,860
they don't, repeat yourself forever. I've been there.

300
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,180
The new way is you upload recipes, generate flashcards and quizzes, and now your team actually

301
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,120
learns and you can test them, right. And repurposing content.

302
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,560
The old way was like one piece of content equals one use.

303
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,080
You write a blog, that's all you get.

304
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Everything else takes more work.

305
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,080
New way is you get one piece of content, six outputs, video slides, infographics, podcasts,

306
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,060
flashcards, quizzes, and it's all from one single upload.

307
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,340
So you see how game-changing all this stuff is and how easy it is to implement as well.

308
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
Let's go back to over here and we'll start building with this.

309
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,800
And the next example I'm going to show you is you can actually upload like 10 of your best performing

310
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,600
YouTube videos and generate a video or a slide deck or some information explaining what makes

311
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,200
Julian's content work and just get a breakdown of what really works for the business, right.

312
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,900
What the best performing piece of content is.

313
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
So let me show you an example of this.

314
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,700
We're actually going to go into Notebook LM.

315
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,100
So I'll grab my top performing YouTube videos and we're going to sort by popular, right.

316
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,620
So which videos are the most popular and why, what were the best hooks, what was the best content, etc.

317
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,180
And it's always best to learn from what worked before.

318
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,360
So I'm going to grab that video, we'll plug it in and we'll grab the next one, all right.

319
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,100
And I'm doing this live so I can show you how quick and easy it is to do.

320
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,960
It literally only takes two minutes to build this but basically you can get like a greatest

321
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,460
hits machine that automates the best hooks and the best content for your business by figuring

322
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,640
out what worked for you previously.

323
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,800
I'm just going to do the top five actually I think, just save a bit of time.

324
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,800
All right so we've loaded the top five sources but I would recommend doing like top 10 minimum

325
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,560
just so you can have enough data, right.

326
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,560
Now what we're going to do is we're going to go to Settings over here, Custom and we say okay

327
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,340
you're a content analyzer trained on Julian Goldie's best performing content. See the videos loaded.

328
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,380
Give Julian advice on what to do based on his best performing content, e.g. hooks, etc.

329
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,180
And we'll say respond as Alex or Moe.

330
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,520
Hit save and then we're going to go inside here and we'll say okay give me five hooks for the

331
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,920
topic and we'll just save the topic from today.

332
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,340
So for example this topic, let's grab that topic up here.

333
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,020
We'll go into another glen and we'll say give me five hooks for a topic based on what worked before.

334
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,820
All right and so we're basically analyzing our content which is on the left hand side.

335
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,300
You can easily do that on YouTube by just going to popular.

336
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,700
If you're on LinkedIn or whatever you can do the same.

337
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,320
This is beginning to play out.

338
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,220
Here's an example and you can use this to build stuff out, right. Same with this, right.

339
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,460
You can see how easy it is to build this stuff out, how quick and easy it is to use.

340
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,080
So for example one could be the ultimate course value stack and it could be like today you're

341
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,960
getting my ultimate course on notebook LM updates.

342
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm going to show you how to host it, how to automate your research, how to turn one document into a full-blown podcast.

343
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,020
This complete masterclass 100% free and we are starting now, right.

344
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,180
That'll be a great hook for a video.

345
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,140
How do we come up with it?

346
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,040
We looked at our best performing content and then we generated it from that, right.

347
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,020
So it's really easy to create this stuff, really easy to automate it and this is smart stuff

348
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,280
that most people would struggle to create themselves.

349
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,520
Now what we could also do is we could go into the AI Profit Boredom community.

350
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,020
So let's do that and if we go to the community here, by the way feel free to join if you haven't already.

351
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,560
This is one of the best AI automation community on the planet my friends, not biased at all.

352
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,260
But we're going to take all the questions as you can see right here.

353
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,280
We can go into notebook LM, create a new notebook.

354
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,160
We'll paste in the text first and then we're going to change the title to FAQs for the AI Profit Boredom.

355
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,940
Alright and then from here what we're going to do is we are going to say over here slide deck

356
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,140
based on the sources loaded which are my customers top FAQs, create an onboarding document and

357
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,840
that's going to generate a slide deck based on the most common FAQs inside the AI Profit Boredom

358
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,980
community and then now we've got an onboarding presentation and when we bring new customers

359
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,960
into the community we can onboard them quickly, we can show them the presentation and they get

360
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,280
all the information and the questions and the answers that you need.

361
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,040
So these are like real business use cases and interesting ones that the people have never really seen before.

362
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,100
Another thing that you could do is you can actually upload your analytics and then use that to generate infographics.

363
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll show you what I mean in a second.

364
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,840
So let's say for example I've got my content here right and I'm going to go to lifetime.

365
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,860
So we analyze all my views and content by lifetime.

366
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,320
Now what we're going to do in a second is actually export that into a csv or a google sheet.

367
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Alright so let's export it into a google sheet.

368
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,800
I'm going to take top content from my channel and we're going to use that in a second to generate

369
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,200
an infographic inside notebook charting digit.

370
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,480
So that's loaded all the data here as you can see.

371
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,380
I'm going to put youtube stats 2025.

372
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,080
Alright then I'm going to go to google drive here, take that document and load that as a source inside notebook lm.

373
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,160
Now using notebook lm and if that fails it's okay, it might be too big.

374
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,620
Let me try and load it as a csv.

375
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,740
Can't load it as a csv, okay no problem.

376
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,900
Let's copy the text and we'll just copy a little bit of it just to make it easy and we'll load

377
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,400
that pasted text into the document as you can see and then we'll create an infographic and basically

378
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,240
you can automate an infographic based on your best content and then get information on okay

379
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,320
what's working, what's not, how to improve etc.

380
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Which content performed the best and that sort of thing which is pretty cool.

381
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,820
The other thing you can do here is you can actually train your team right.

382
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,940
So for example here we can take this like and we can go into deep research like that.

383
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:40,060
Let me say buy me the best link building strategies 2025 right.

384
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,400
We can actually generate some deep research on the best link building strategies 2025, generate

385
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,340
a massive report and then create flashcards to train the team members at my SEO agency.

386
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,920
So we can quickly generate these reports that we find extremely useful for training our team internally.

387
00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,260
So for example I've loaded my best like sales recipes and playbooks into notebook and then use

388
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,540
that as a chatbot to train my team right. Really powerful and easy.

389
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,680
So you can generate like quizzes to test new hires.

390
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,160
You could upload client briefs and create flashcards for your team to memorize client details before course.

391
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,140
You could upload your course content and then generate certification quizzes for AI Profit Boarding members right.

392
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,840
All sorts of cool stuff here and then if you want to see examples of what we've built previously

393
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,700
let me find some examples here.

394
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,660
For example like this one you can see on the right hand side we've actually for example got an infographic.

395
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,840
We have videos of slides etc podcasts even content in Chinese.

396
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,620
You can actually create content in foreign languages too.

397
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,480
Then you see some examples of like featured notebooks here as well.

398
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,120
So these are actually like featured notebooks as you can see drawn on the latest scientific

399
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,480
research and work of classic philosophers to lead a more fulfilling life right.

400
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,100
And then it's actually got like ancient wisdom all these different podcasts on the right hand

401
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,880
side that have been for this.

402
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,720
It's amazing for learning, for growing, for improving, for fixing business problems, for creating automations, content etc.

403
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,000
You could do this all inside Notebook LM. Pretty powerful.

404
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,640
And some people say AI content looks fake and looks cheap etc and that was true like two years ago but not anymore.

405
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,340
The videos Notebook LM creates look really professional. The slides look clean.

406
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,760
The infographics look like something a design agency made. Is it perfect?

407
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,800
No but nothing is perfect and it's 90% of the way there.

408
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,320
And that last 10% you could always tweak yourself in minutes.

409
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,760
So don't let the fear of AI content looks bad stop you from making any content at all.

410
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,560
A lot of people as well will say my business is different and that sort of thing.

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,820
And every business owner says this. My business is different.

412
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,500
This won't work for me blah blah blah.

413
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,380
Let me ask you something.

414
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,520
Do you have documents, pdfs, blog posts, saps, client briefs, any kind of written content at all?

415
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,300
If yes, Notebook works for you.

416
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,060
We use it for our SEO agency all the time.

417
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,280
I use it for their profit border.

418
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
I use it for YouTube content.

419
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,700
Members in our community use it for consulting, ecom, real estate agency etc.

420
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,060
Your business is not different.

421
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,240
Your business has content and this tool turns that content into more content.

422
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,400
So it's pretty simple and easy.

423
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,940
And if you have any questions as we go along, feel free to ask. It says hello.

424
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,160
Alright so you see how to use Notebook LM, how powerful it is.

425
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,040
Let me talk about an easy way to quickly generate this using the Goldie 6-in-1 content multiplier framework.

426
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,880
So this is my personal system for turning one piece of content into six different assets using Notebook LM.

427
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,620
What you'll be able to do after you learn this framework is you'll be able to take any single

428
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,460
document and create for example video of you.

429
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,680
So a short video of AI narration explaining your content.

430
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,920
Slide decks aka a professional presentation with graphs and visuals.

431
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,600
Infographics, a visual summary perfect for social media.

432
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,940
Deep research reports, a cooperative analysis with over 30 sources.

433
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,160
Flashcards which are quick reference cards for training on studies.

434
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,060
And quizzes, an interactive test to check understanding all from one upload in under 10 minutes.

435
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,380
Now it says what's the digital avatar?

436
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,620
You only make this sound in the video with your voice or it's all everything AI automatic.

437
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,860
So the digital avatar for example like the videos on my YouTube channel like this one.

438
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,800
These are videos which automatically create with AI.

439
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,920
Right so I don't create them, my team creates them, we have editors, you can train the whole process.

440
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,480
But yeah basically it's all trained.

441
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,780
The AI is trained on my voice, the video is created automatically and then you can also generate content with AI.

442
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,160
If you want to learn more about that we have trainings inside all you're going to do is just

443
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,440
go to classroom over here and then inside the AI Profit Boarding you're going to go to the playbook

444
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,680
and inside the playbook you have all of these different strategies on how to use AI avatars

445
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,960
like this one right here.

446
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,820
Right it's a full training program with step-by-step tutorial on exactly how to generate these AI avatar videos.

447
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,620
So let's get back to this now.

448
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,500
So let me show you a 30-day implementation roadmap so you can start mastering this.

449
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,880
Day one seven foundation week.

450
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,340
What you're going to do is get set up and make your first right so you could for example gather

451
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,440
your best content this could be your best your most popular blogs, pdfs, notes from your best

452
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,180
presentations, company fbs, client case studies etc and you can just upload one piece of content

453
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,140
to notebooklm but don't overthink it just pick something generate your first audio overview

454
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,100
the podcast feature listen to it and just get a feel for how notebooklm works right.

455
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,500
So you can generate podcasts like you see on the right hand side how do you do that you just

456
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,440
create a new notebook like this and then you're going to click on audio overview and that's

457
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,200
how you generate podcasts inside notebook.

458
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,640
You can click on video view up and then you can use that to generate a podcast as well.

459
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,820
The other thing to note here is that notebooklm now save chat history so inside your notebook

460
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,700
you can see all the things you've asked the notebook as you see inside the chat section here

461
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,740
so you can always reflect and go back on this stuff too if you want.

462
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,060
Alright day 8 to 14 this is like expansion time test all the different outputs try the slide

463
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,280
deck feature upload the case study report see what kind of presentation it builds etc try the

464
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,900
infographic features and then day 15 to 21 system week right so you're going to build your personal

465
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,040
console flow and that sort of thing.

466
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,720
The other cool thing is when you're building out these systems for example I've loaded my sales

467
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,000
playbook inside here I could actually ask the trainer okay what could I improve on this SAP

468
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,520
to make it better plus easier to follow right and then we can basically create like a better

469
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,040
system based on notebooklm looking at our existing systems to see okay how can we improve this

470
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,240
what do we need to change here so it's actually prioritizing the best steps looking at what

471
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,420
the best thing to do is here and it's actually giving us like a clean script document for example

472
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,280
idea or group the golden rules stop repeating yourself right organized by phase for example

473
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,880
like the setup the mindset the process the grind etc and all these other different things so

474
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,480
it's pretty cool. and then in the 30-day roadmap for using notebooklm and mastering it you know

475
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,180
ramp up production and get faster right so you're going to run the system each week you create

476
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,340
one anchor piece of content you can multiply it in six and track results see which outputs get

477
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,380
the most engagement which ones to try the most leads double down on what works and also share

478
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,160
your wins inside the airprofit board post your outputs get feedback see what other members are

479
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,440
creating and by day 30 you should have a repeatable content system it takes a fraction of what

480
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,340
you used to spend so you can post your progress inside the airprofit board here just go to the

481
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,020
win section and then you can share your wins just like everyone else is inside the airprofit

482
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,960
board like Scott, Michelle, Vladimir etc.

483
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,220
Vladimir created his own MCP server which is pretty cool telegram hosting robots being created

484
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,620
all this cool stuff that other members inside the airprofit board are building and then here's

485
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,420
a bunch of live build ideas by the way if you want the video notes from today you can get it

486
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,660
inside the AI success lab link in the comments description you can see here we have 40,000 members

487
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,000
who are serious about using AI automation so if you want to connect with them you can join the

488
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,740
airprofit board room inside the classroom here if you go to december 2025 you can see the free

489
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,740
video notes from today along with the custom build ideas and everything that i'm showing you

490
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,780
right. so let's talk about homework. what would i recommend after this? after this video here's

491
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,000
what i want you to do. go to notebooklm, it's free you get it right there. upload one document

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,420
you already have right that could be a blog post, a pdf, a case study, anything. generate at

493
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,180
least two different outputs. so for example try the video feature, try the slide depth feature,

494
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,660
see what happens. then post your results inside the airprofit board and community. show us what

495
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,580
you made, get feedback, celebrate your wins, connect with me right and do that all inside the

496
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,820
airprofit board right here and don't just take my word for it like that this stuff actually

497
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,800
works. we actually have over 100 pages of testimonials from real members getting real results

498
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,560
with real automation right. so for example if we check out the testimonials document of the

499
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,400
airprofit board you can see all of these people just getting awesome results with ai right if

500
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,610
you want to learn about this if you want to grow with this check out the airpo- board because

501
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,410
you can see all these people just winning and learning and growing with it. it's literally a

502
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,930
endless scroll at this point. all right, so just showed you something powerful. okay notebook

503
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,550
lem is free. you need to have one document, six different pieces of content. but here's the

504
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,270
thing: the tool is just a tool. what matters is the system around it. and that's exactly what

505
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,350
i'm going to show you inside the air right now. we have a offerum for the airprofit board. so

506
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,910
if you sign up now, you get access to coaching support. you get access to the community, the

507
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:31,350
classroom, the calendar. and we actually have a few spots left on our latest offer, right? which

508
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,190
is, if we scroll down here inside the community, we are offering a few things. simple number

509
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,590
one: you'll get the exact system for growing a school community. so if you want to build your

510
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,910
own school community for your business, which i know a lot of people are interested in right

511
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,510
now, we actually have training inside the airprofit board showing you exactly how to do that.

512
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,690
on top of that, you'll get the ai avatar clone system. so you'll learn how to clone yourself

513
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,770
with ai make video content without being on camera. one member inside the airprofit board actually

514
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,770
built a faceless channel that is getting like thousands of subscribers right now. we also have

515
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:09,310
a twitter ai automation method. so we'll show you how i automate my x account to reach how many

516
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:15,150
people do reach per day, like 170,000 people a day on x right? so if you want to learn how i

517
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:20,790
automated x with ai join the airprofit board. on top of that, you get the empire builder focus

518
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,890
manual. right? so when you actually sign up, you'll see the start here section inside the airport,

519
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,830
as you can see. and inside here, we actually have something called the focus protocol Julian

520
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,410
Goldie ultimate focus manual. right? and inside that manual, we'll basically show you my personal

521
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,070
productivity system so that you can avoid overwhelm and get more done in less time. you'll also

522
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:44,450
learn how to rank the board with free access to the seo circle and all sorts of stuff. so if

523
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,410
you want to get that link in the comments description to the airprofit board, and you can get

524
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,030
that directly inside there. when jan says, where can we access the document?" and if you go

525
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,230
into this live stream on youtube and then you go to the description here, you can get access

526
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,870
right here. all right, so click on that link. you can get access to the success, lab, and then.

527
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,230
inside the classroom, you go to december 2025, and you'll find all the info right here on the

528
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,310
video note. completely free. for example, here you can create a new notebook. and one of the

529
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,810
most recent updates you can use is deep research. right now, this is super powerful because

530
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,990
if you need to go in depth on something about notebook glen then you can go inside here and

531
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,710
just type in whatever you want and then get access to it directly. so let me show you what i

532
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,830
mean. let's say, for example, i want to learn 10, right? i can actually type in na10 automation

533
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,250
over here inside, and then we're going to enter like so. and that will actually plan out all

534
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,550
the deep research for our notebook. and then once we've done that, we can generate all of these.

535
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,390
now the great thing about deep research inside notebook glen is that you can load like multiple

536
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,110
sources, and you don't have to do any research yourself. and it will just go super in depth

537
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,070
across our web. now if you want to see some examples what i've built previously using notebook

538
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,610
glen let me show you some examples right here. so you see here, for example, we've got notebook

539
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:00,130
lms for google flows updates, google disco. we've got a rseo content right here, a community

540
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,550
retention engagement tool, the advanced sales operating procedure. this is actually a tool that

541
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,430
i built to train my team, my sales team, on like exactly how to use my playbook for getting

542
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,350
clients, right? and convert them on the course. now what you can also do, and this is a new

543
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:18,750
update from gemini this is not a free version, but i'm sure it will come out for free. you can

544
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,390
actually go inside gemini and load up a notebook and go super deep in with it, right? so for

545
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,050
example, if we load this up, we're gonna, for example, pull up the advanced sales operating

546
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:33,730
procedure here. then we can go to tools, canvas, and we can say, okay turn this into a beautifully

547
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,610
designed web page or landing page," right? basically what that would do is connect notebook

548
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:48,770
glen to gemini and then we can start using that notebook to build out a new tool. or a you can

549
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,050
actually select multiple notebooks on the list like this, and it will reference some more. now

550
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,370
you can't do that inside notebook glen directly, so it's a pretty powerful tool. and then if

551
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,790
we get into the cell, it will start to do that and start to work its magic. now if we go back

552
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,730
to notebook glen it's still doing the deep research, as you can see right here. but yeah, google

553
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,070
has just dropped like tons of new updates to notebook, glen, and here's. the thing: like most

554
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,890
people have no idea these even exist yet, right? now we're just testing these updates together.

555
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:14,250
i haven't used all of them, but you're watching me discover them in real time. and we've looked

556
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,850
at, for example, the deep research agent. you can also use image uploads inside notebook glen

557
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:23,830
as well, right? so if we go inside here, we can start plugging in sources here. and if we go

558
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,970
inside this section, we can click on add sources, and you can see that you can actually upload

559
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:32,830
images as a source, right? now this is pretty cool because then you can actually use images

560
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,150
and use that as training data for your systems. let me show you an example why that'd be useful.

561
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:41,990
so let's say, for example, you wanted to automate creating facebook ads, right? and you already

562
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,850
create a lot of facebook ads copy. be like, okay i want to use even more of this to generate

563
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,290
better outputs." let me show you what i mean. so we can take a recent facebook ad from some

564
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,990
of my campaigns, and then it's the copy that we write inside the ad, plus the creative, right?

565
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:00,390
so we can take that like so. we can copy that. we can actually upload that as a file inside

566
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:06,010
here, right? so if we x off here, go to create new, upload that screenshot, and that's actually

567
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,230
training the notebook glen on the ads campaign that we've just built. why is that useful? it's

568
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,990
useful because now we can automate anything that's image-based to create more or better related

569
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:21,150
media. right now, you got to see, love glen it's not just like a chatbot like gemini or a custom

570
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,990
gpt or whatever. this is more like a media station where you can, for example, generate audio

571
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,950
views or video views and that sort of thing. now i'm going to show you why that's important

572
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,550
in a minute. but in the meantime, let's go back to the deep research that is now completed.

573
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,550
that took a few minutes. you can open up the sources it's generated here. if you don't like

574
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,450
any of them, you can unclick them. like and now this is going to use all the deep research we've

575
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,950
built using nsn so you can see here we've got 38 sources inside our nsn research. we can click

576
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,950
import, and that will now train the notebook glen on all that information around around nsn

577
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,130
and ai automation. now why is that useful? it's useful because now we can actually ask a custom

578
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:01,890
trained nsn automation expert, which is all the best access to all the best resources on the

579
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,590
internet for nsn and use that to help us build stuff out. all right, we'll come back to that

580
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,130
in a second. let's see what else we got here. spawner says, nice session, thank you very much."

581
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,810
fairly says, notebook glen is the best research tool on the market right now, so helpful." yeah

582
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,570
i would agree with that. i think it is incredibly powerful and helpful, right? as you can see

583
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,470
here, for example, we've now got the notebook lm nsn automation expert. now if we wanted to

584
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,830
understand how nsn works, we can click on infographic, right? or if we wanted to really master

585
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,890
the art of nsn we could actually create flashcards or a quiz based on that. so we could quiz

586
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,250
ourselves on an nsn and we could learn things really quickly based on that, right? what we can

587
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:43,350
also do here is we could go inside here and say, okay how do i build an ai agent on nsn right

588
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:48,170
and that's a super simple question, but you could go as in-depth as you needed to, right? now

589
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,090
once whilst waiting for that, we're still training the notebook on this ad image. but once that's

590
00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:01,750
done, we'd be able to ask it to add or infographics, etc. we could actually take that facebook

591
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,030
ad image that we're training the custom notebook lamp on, and then from here, we could even

592
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,290
generate, for example, a video sales letter using the video view section, and that could like

593
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,330
pair with what you're doing right now. so yeah, there you go. mac says, yeah i did a whole teardown

594
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,470
using that strategy from prompts chat to the custom gpt prompts for the seven cards." all right,

595
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,870
so now we've got the example here based on the information that it has. here's how you build

596
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,290
a ai agent using nsn and then it's given the information. like you set up the trigger, then

597
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,850
you connect the chat model, right? then you connect the tools, etc. and what we can do over

598
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,630
here as well is create like a nice slide deck, so like a powerpoint presentation about that

599
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,790
topic. so let's say, for example, you are presenting on a particular topic, and let's say you're

600
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,170
a content creator, or let's say you've got loads of information about this topic, and you need

601
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,910
to organize it all together. you could upload all your documents on the left-hand side, then

602
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,250
ask nsn to generate a slide deck using that custom training information in order to create a

603
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:57,430
powerful presentation that you're good to go on, right? super simple and easy. wait it takes

604
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,870
images also now too? yeah that's something that's new but pretty amazing. and you can see here

605
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,850
as well, we can generate video views, my maps, etc. by the way, if you want to get all the video

606
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,010
notes from today, it's all inside the ai successor lab where you can connect with 40,000 members,

607
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,290
as you can see in post inside the community. get help, etc. people introducing themselves and

608
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,270
sharing cool stuff and that sort of thing. if you go to the classroom here, then you go to december

609
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,370
2025. so this is brand new. all this stuff is brand new and newly updated, etc. and you can

610
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:28,750
see the video notes from today inside the ai successor lab so. that's all available to you along

611
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,130
with many other tutorials, right? i mean, this is one of the most powerful resources on the

612
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,210
planet for research, and it's completely free. if you want to get access to that notebook clip,

613
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,190
you can also, for example, check out this quiz. so you see here, what is the primary metric,

614
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,750
blah blah, and then you can just go through here and select whichever one you want and test

615
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,990
yourself, right? so you can see if you actually know what you're talking about or not. and then

616
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,210
let me paint you a picture. so this is a research every entrepreneur knows, right? you're trying

617
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,690
to create content about your topic. maybe it's for a client, maybe it's for your own business,

618
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,870
maybe you're just trying to understand something new in your industry. so what do you do? you

619
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,510
might have 47 browser tabs open. you copy and paste into google doc you watch youtube videos

620
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,170
and take notes. you screenshot things from x right? you save pdfs that you'll read later. and

621
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,710
three hours later, you're drowning in information with no clear answer. your brain is fried.

622
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,470
you still haven't created anything, and you're not even sure if the information you found out

623
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,990
is good or not. that is the old way, right? and the old way, this is how things used to work.

624
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,330
is like you have to find every article, video, and document yourself, right? there was no image

625
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:32,010
support. you had sources cluttered everything, right? you have to start from scratch every time.

626
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:37,410
no chat history. you couldn't combine like different resources and that sort of thing together.

627
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,470
whereas now, with the new update from notebook on that google just dropped, you can use a deep

628
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,010
research agent. so you just tell it what you want to know, and it finds and analyzes like over

629
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,870
20 sources automatically. you can use image uploads like screenshots, stem diagrams, and visual

630
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,750
data as a searchable source. you can clean up everything in one click. so you can just import

631
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,790
all the sources i've shown you today, like the deep research that we did for this natan agent.

632
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:03,130
you can take photos and add sources from your phone. you can also combine knowledge from different

633
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,310
projects inside gemini like we did today, right? you can see how we created this nice little

634
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,030
landing page based on multiple different notebooks at the top. it looks pretty nice, right?

635
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:15,090
that looks pretty. and then you can have custom outputs. so for example, infographic, select

636
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,130
videos in different visual styles. and so it's pretty amazing what you can build with this stuff.

637
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,070
this looks super nice as well. and how quick and easy was it to do? super fast, right? you can

638
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,690
see that we built a quiz, and we can just learn anything that we want or research anything that

639
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,050
we want, manage it really well, right? so some people think like they need to manually find

640
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,530
every source themselves when they're using research tools. and here's what most people think:

641
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,750
if you want good research, you have to hunt down every single source yourself. maybe people

642
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,590
think like they need to know where to look, or you need to spend hours researching. and that's

643
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,750
what i used to think too. but it's what actually happens when you use deep research. you type

644
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,390
one sentence about what you want to know. the agent goes out and finds 20 relevant resources.

645
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,590
it reads them all, creates a comparative report, citations, imports sources into your notebook,

646
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:56,790
all in about five minutes. and so the real problem isn't finding sources. the real problem is

647
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:01,370
like wasting hours doing what an agent can do in minutes, right? and notebook is like one of

648
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,650
the most powerful tools i've ever seen. robbie says, woo just joined. good to see." it all right,

649
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,950
cool. and yeah, let's talk about the Goldie Research Acceleration System all. right, so what

650
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,670
the system actually does, this is how you turn any topic into complete research content assets

651
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,150
and presentations in under 30 days using notebook lm's new features. most people use notebook

652
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,130
lm to ask basic questions. that's like buying a car and using it to sit in your driveway. this

653
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:28,250
system shows you the difference between using a tool and actually leveraging it to build business

654
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,790
assets. and the core concept here is like you've got one research hop with multiple outputs,

655
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:37,490
right? so if you go on to this, for example, you can even create like a data table inside notebook

656
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,910
lm and this is on the na10 agent, as you can see. but basically, the old way was like different

657
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,590
files scattered everywhere, no connection between your research and your content. and the new

658
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,550
way is one notebook becomes your research hop. so everything that you create flows from that

659
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,150
single source of truth. and you upload sources once, then you extract research reports for your

660
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:59,070
own understanding, infographics for social media, slide decks for client presentations, videos

661
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,510
for content marketing, and organized notes for articles or scripts. it's the same research,

662
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,770
but you get multiple formats with maximum leverage. and this works for you specifically because

663
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,910
if you're watching this, you probably have a smaller business, and you want to learn a automation,

664
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,530
but you don't want to hire loads of people to help you, right? because that would be a nightmare.

665
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,330
and so maybe you don't have a research team, you don't have a content team, you don't have a

666
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,150
design team, but you're one person trying to stay informed in your industry, create content

667
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,530
consistently, look professional to clients, and actually deliver your core service. and so this

668
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,830
amount showing you gives you a research team, a content team, and design team capabilities without

669
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,370
hiring anyone. that is the entire point, my friends. all right, so if we go to this notebook,

670
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:39,070
as you can see, we've automated the infographic, and now you don't need a designer, right? you've

671
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,550
got this nsn method right here that's basically taken all the information from our notebook

672
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,570
and then turned it into a beautiful infographic, right? you see we've got the slide generator

673
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,690
over here. we have the data table method for research. we also have the mind map, right? so

674
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,230
you can explore whatever you want inside here. so let's say you want to go deeper on ai and

675
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,010
agenda workflows. you can do it like this. then you can open that up and go deeper and deeper

676
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,790
as you want to. and then you've even got the quiz that we talked about earlier, where you can

677
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,430
test yourself based on what you learn it. and then you see here it's generating the video, the

678
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:11,490
audio, and the slide deck, but they tend to take a bit more time, right? that tends to take

679
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,210
a lot longer to generate. here's an example, right? so if we actually open this up, you can

680
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:20,510
see, for example, we have the video right here. so this is a video that's generated and animated

681
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,830
based on the information we've loaded, right? and it's actually a narrated video that we've

682
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,710
automated using the research as well, right? now if you want a 30-day plan for implementing

683
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,250
this stuff, we'll actually put it inside the ai success lab link in the comments description.

684
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,410
inside there, you'll be able to connect with 40,000 different ai entrepreneurs who are trying

685
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:40,790
to grow and scale with ai automation. you can post inside the community, connect with cool people

686
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,990
inside the classroom here. if you go to december 2025, you'll get all the video notes from today,

687
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,010
and you can just read through and implement the 30-day plan, as you can see right here. and

688
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,090
it gives you homework for every single stage of the process, which is pretty amazing. so super

689
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,990
actionable, easy to implement. you learn exactly what to do. i've given you some example prompt

690
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,330
packs as well. so for example, i've given you a prompt pack for research report generation,

691
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,530
content creation, client and business use. and there's stuff that i could build for my own business.

692
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:10,450
for example, i have an seo agency, so i could create notebooks for each major seo update or

693
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,790
algorithmic change, ai tool evaluation process. when google releases new tools, like for example,

694
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:19,390
these notebook lm updates, i could create a notebook with the announcement posts, early user

695
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:26,050
reviews, comparison articles, and the can give me a complete analysis, which i can turn into

696
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,970
content for my live streams or infographics for my community or training materials, right? and

697
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,530
so, you can see how powerful this stuff is. most people fail with ai tools because they're using

698
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,570
like search engines. one question, one answer, move on. this system builds a knowledge asset

699
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,050
that grows more valuable over time because every source you add makes this notebook smarter,

700
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,950
right? and every output you generate is based on comprehensive research, not surface-level prompts.

701
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,210
and every notebook becomes a specialist that you can consult instantly. that's the difference

702
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,930
between using a tool and building a system. and don't measure this by how good is the infographic,

703
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,930
correct? that's not the way to look at this. you want to measure it by how much time did you

704
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:04,140
save. on research per week, what client education materials you can create in minutes instead

705
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,680
of days? what's the quality of answers when prospects ask you tough questions? what's the speed

706
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,960
of content creation when you need to post something valuable? and i've given a list of like

707
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,560
common mistakes to avoid. but you can see here how you can navigate after that 30-day plan that

708
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,760
you've implemented, that i've shown you a second ago. by day 30, you'll have five to ten active

709
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,660
notebooks on different topics, a library of generated infographics, slide decks, and videos,

710
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,100
a weekly routine for adding source and creating outputs, client-facing materials ready to use,

711
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,180
elite magnets that are actively generating you new audiences and new potential customers. all

712
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,720
right, now if you want to see some examples of how people winning with this source, you can

713
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,720
see our AI Profit Boarding testimonial document here. it's got over 106 pages, not 106 testimonials,

714
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,720
106 pages of testimonials from people winning with AI automation inside the AI Profit Boarding.

715
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
let's just scroll to a random example. for example, here i actually built out an amazing tool,

716
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,440
and Gerson said, wow thanks! this would make a huge difference for all. it's i really appreciate

717
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,100
and now i have direction. will continue to learn from the courses laid out here. appreciate

718
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,960
it." for example, here Nora asking for a content humanizer. i sent her a link. as you can see,

719
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,340
Nora says, thanks used it, and it worked pretty amazing." Paolo, happy to share with you, just

720
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,800
create my first avatar, and we'll start sharing insights and social media platforms using it.

721
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,680
comments critiques are welcome. thanks Julian, for inspiring us. so like, my goal is really

722
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,720
just to help as many people as i can on the planet with automation. and if you want to learn

723
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,680
this stuff, you can get it inside the AI Profit Boarding here. all right, so let's talk about

724
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,600
what you actually get when you join the AI Profit Boarding. see what's happening. i'm teaching

725
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,340
all this stuff about Noble GLAM. we're testing these tools live. you'll see how it works. but

726
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,660
you know what? that's just one single tool. and if you leave here today with just knowledge

727
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,980
about Noble GLAM, you're still stuck with the same problem you had before, right? with just

728
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,840
too many tools, not enough systems, and no clear path forward. so here's what i built: the AI

729
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,160
Profit Boarding, where solopreneurs and small agency owners come to turn scattered AI knowledge

730
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,520
into actual business systems that save time and get you more customers. right and so what you're

731
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,640
going to get is the complete AI Profit Boarding training library. this includes the 85 formula

732
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,800
for cutting work, to complete AI automation ecosystems for Google, including Gemini, Noble GLAM,

733
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,160
AI Studio, and Workspace, automation setup training for NHSN, make and other platforms, content

734
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,960
creation systems that works all the stuff i do is based on that. lead generation automation

735
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,680
frameworks and SEO and traffic strategies, right? and inside the AI Profit Boarding, you can

736
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,360
get inside the classroom all of these different trainings, as you can see right here. now one

737
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,860
of the best things about this is the daily accountability. so you can post your goals and what

738
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,320
you're going to work on today. hold each other accountable, learn and grow together, as you

739
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,240
can see. and then inside the community here, if you get questions, if you want to share stuff,

740
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,560
for example, look at this. right Paris said, this is how powerful AI is." right and you can

741
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,540
see how powerful this is based on this post shared right here. and people are just sharing new

742
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,320
cool stuff like this all the time. so we're learning and growing. we're winning. but we also

743
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,440
do daily check-ins, weekly deep dives, and monthly strategy goals so that you're not learning

744
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,480
alone, right? you're in a community of people building the same systems that you are. plus you

745
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,540
can jump on camera with me on my team during coaching calls, like you see today. also if you

746
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,200
get stuck on something, you can message me directly inside the AI Profit Boarding. so you can

747
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,240
DM me, as you can see right here. ask me any questions, and that means that I answer member

748
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,980
questions throughout the day. no waiting for the next group call. no posting in the forum hoping

749
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,520
someone responds. top of that, you get unlimited tech support, right? so our team helps you

750
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,240
troubleshoot, set up automations, and solve technical problems. and you don't need to figure

751
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,940
this out alone. and then you also get ready-to-use templates and prompts. every training comes

752
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,040
with these app prompts, templates, and frameworks to use. you don't need to start from scratch;

753
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,820
you just copy what works. so for example, inside here, if you go to classroom, inside the playbook,

754
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,780
you can learn how to, for example, create AI avatar videos, like you can see right here. you

755
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,660
can learn how to, for example, generate leads from Instagram shorts. how I create shorts on

756
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,560
YouTube that are AI generated and get tons of views. right let's have a look. for example, if

757
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,460
we go on to my shorts recently here, you can see all the shorts were posted, and most of these

758
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,900
are generated. check this one out: 66,000 views on this AI generated short on YouTube. so you

759
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,120
know, the more people you reach, the more people that know about your business, the better you

760
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,500
do, right? how can you reach more people? you can use systems like this to basically automate

761
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,560
content creation. so that's all inside the AI Profit Boarding. link in the comments description.

762
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,920
how to do ARSEO with notebook LM, which is a super powerful and free tool you can use. you can

763
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,420
actually combine it with Gemini now as well.

764
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:12,400
I'll show you what I mean in a second. and if you love notebook you're going love this video,

765
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,980
I think. so what you see here is this a traffic chart of juliangolder.com, and you can see with

766
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,500
AISEO, we're like, we're just getting awesome results. we've taken this website from literally

767
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,860
zero clicks per day to getting thousands of clicks with AISEO, as you can see. and you can see

768
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,900
the traffic chart is just popping off right now. so it's growing up really nicely. we generate

769
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,500
traffic to this website, and obviously, this funnels traffic to our agency, as you can see.

770
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,880
so we're posting blogs on the blog over here all the time, and these pages actually rank in

771
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,860
traffic and do well. all right, so if you want to steal the processes work for me personally,

772
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:48,260
then you can get this today. all right, so if you never checked out notebook LM, this is what

773
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,260
it looks like. it's a free tool within limits, and on notebooklm.google, you can get access

774
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,080
to it. and then you can go inside here and get all these featured notebooks. now you can do

775
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,600
the basics, right? so for example, let's say I wanted to create a new notebook and then generate

776
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,260
some SEO content for that, right? let me show you how that works. we're going to go to YouTube here.

777
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,980
I'm going to pull in some sources that I can create content around. so for example, let's say

778
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,300
I want to create a blog about, I don't know, genspark right? so I'm going to take the transcript.

779
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,420
we'll plug that into notebooklm in fact, you know what?

780
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,860
I'll just copy the video, and then we can load the video. and from here, we have to load in

781
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,200
our sources. so I'm going to click on YouTube up here. all right? and then what I'm also going

782
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,360
to do is I'm going to add a new source, right? to add sources, we're going to plug in website.

783
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,800
I'm just going to plug in my website URL, and basically, this will custom train the notebook

784
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,540
on genspark and the new update, which we're going to create content around. and then also my

785
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,120
website, which is where I want to funnel traffic to, right? and so it's concentrating on YSL

786
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,180
and also the latest update that I want to create content around for SEO. so from here, what

787
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,840
we can do is we can then take this notebook and create, for example, a video of you that we

788
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,880
actually rank directly on YouTube, right? so if we type in that, like so, it will start to generate

789
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,840
that. now why is that what it's important? because you can actually get a lot of traffic directly

790
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,620
from YouTube itself, right? so for example, if we type in like notebook SEO, you can see that

791
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,800
I'm ranking directly on YouTube for that particular keyword. all right, that's great. and so

792
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,260
you can create videos from notebook LM, and then you could actually upload those to YouTube

793
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,180
directly and rank them on YouTube. now the other cool thing about this is if we go on to Google,

794
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,900
we can see that we also rank number one for that keyword several times, right? so for notebook

795
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,600
LM SEO, right? and so the video that you create from notebook LM can actually rank directly

796
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,200
on YouTube and also directly on Google, right? nice that's pretty cool. all right, now if we

797
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,060
go on to perplexy this should also rank inside AI search engines as well. all right, so if we

798
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:39,080
type in notebook LM SEO over here and we'll search on perplexy and it's being super buggy, but

799
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,860
we'll see what it does in a sec. maybe it's broken. if not, we'll go to chat your team generally,

800
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:47,960
and you can see that actually uses sources from YouTube to generate the outputs inside, right?

801
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,760
so for example, it's actually used, for example, my video here as a source inside perplexy and

802
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,940
so when. you're generating these videos or when you're creating content on YouTube around that

803
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,780
particular topic, you rank in inside YouTube, on Google, and directly inside search engines

804
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,380
as well, right? as a source, pretty insane. and so one video can rank multiple times. how to

805
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,440
generate the video? you can just generate a video overview inside notebook LM, or you could

806
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,240
use some of the AI efforts to teach inside the AI proctor boardroom as well. now what you can

807
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,220
also do is you could go inside here and you could take a prompt. this is one of my favorite

808
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,540
prompts from the AI proctor boardroom and you can take this prompt like that. we can type in

809
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:28,040
the topic we want to rank for. so example: genspark AI update. we'll take that, and it's actually

810
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,280
going to analyze the sources from here and then generate a blog post based on that particular

811
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,740
topic. all right, so we've custom trained our sources. now we need to create a blog post. how

812
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,840
do we create the blog post? we can use a prompt like this. it's inside the AI proctor boardroom

813
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,760
if you want to steal it. and then you can see this generate a whole blog for that particular

814
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,600
topic. all right? and so then inside notebook you can generate the topic itself, plus you can

815
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:53,060
generate the video, right? so a blog and a video that's going to rank directly on google and

816
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,740
AI search engines like publicity as you can see right here. now here's another example what

817
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,860
you can do. so you can actually load the notebook. it's a nice little hack just came out this

818
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,860
week, right? so we can take that notebook that's custom trained on the sources we want to create

819
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:09,500
content around. we can plug that in, and then what we can actually do here that's really interesting

820
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:15,300
is we can rank custom tools that we build on an exact match domain on google for that particular

821
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,960
keyword. let me show you what i mean. so if we go into ahs and let's say you want to rank directly

822
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,900
on google for a keyword, let's say for example, enterprise seoi calculator. you get 600 searches

823
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,600
per month, so that's 6,000 searches per year if you write for it. that would be great, right?

824
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,760
now you can actually see a website that i've custom built with AI ranking number one for that

825
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,600
particular keyword, right? and it funnels traffic to book in an SEO strategy session with my

826
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,060
agency. so we can use this as a way to generate more leads, and all we have to do is create

827
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,620
a simple tool on an exact match domain. for example, like if the keyword is enterprise seoi

828
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,840
calculator, then we just create a website called enterprise seoi calculator. and then from there,

829
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:54,000
we can start working our magic, right? and so how would we do this with notebook let we can

830
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,320
take in the notebook that we've just generated, so notebook and then we can go to tools canvas

831
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:06,500
right? and we can say, okay create a custom sass tool about the new genspark ai update plus

832
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:13,360
have a cta on page to funnel traffic to the ai profit boardroom which is here via this link."

833
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,460
all right? so create a custom sass tool, the update, plus have a cta on the page to funnel traffic

834
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,980
to there, right? and then from here, what we're also going to say optimize the landing page

835
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,760
content plus headlines, etc., to get the keyword genspark ai update, right? and so just to recap

836
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,580
here, we can create a custom sass tool that ranks number one for our exact match domain. so

837
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,340
if our keyword is this, we would create an exact match domain for that, right? and then we can

838
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,400
rank it on google funnel traffic to our website, and all we need to do is create one single

839
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,700
page that can rank, right? how do we do that? we can load in the notebook plus generate a tool

840
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,240
on canvas so we're going to click enter like so, and that will start generating the tool inside

841
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,180
canvas based on the notebook that we've got over here. and we're good to go on this. standby

842
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,160
loading says, good morning! i have a question. when i have a lot of information, but i want

843
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,480
to separate a part of them for a video, how does it work?" my result? yeah all right. so if

844
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,800
you want to generate a video inside notebook alemba you want to separate the information. what

845
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,820
you can do is inside notebook alemba here, with the sources loaded and your notebook custom

846
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,540
trained, you can go to video overview. but you're going to click on edit here, and then you

847
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,160
can actually change the design visual style. if you're from germany so for example, standby

848
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,480
loading, i know you're from germany so we can go to germany and create the content in german

849
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,500
i believe. oh yeah, deutsch so you can use deutsch i guess, right? and then from here, we'll

850
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,340
switch back to english but we can choose our custom design like this. we can choose between

851
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,780
whether it's a brief video or an explainer. i would recommend going with the explainer. and

852
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:37,100
then here, you tell it what to focus on, right? so if you have individual pieces of information

853
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,360
that you want to generate, like standby loading does, you just put it inside the custom instructions,

854
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,720
and you tell it exactly what to focus on. and that's how it works, right? super easy and simple.

855
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,200
so then inside of canvas we now have the tool, as you can see. we can share that. but the main

856
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,040
thing is here, you want to get the code, save it as a file offline, and then upload it to netlify

857
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,660
so you can host it, right? that's what i did for the page that you can see here. we actually

858
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,680
coded this with bolt but using this node new notebook lm framework, you can use notebook lm

859
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,940
instead to generate the outputs. so it's simple, super simple and easy. and then you can see

860
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,600
the here we can test it out. we can create a report, etc. you see how it's got a cta to join

861
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,060
the air profit boardroom at the top. click on that, it goes straight to our landing page. boom

862
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,480
shaka laka, my friends! and then it's got cta at the bottom as well, as you can see. so anyone

863
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,600
who lands on this page is interested about ai what would be the natural next step? join our

864
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,040
automation community where they can learn new workflows and implement this stuff inside their

865
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,100
business. and so it links naturally together, and it funnels traffic from that keyword to this

866
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,800
that much domain and from the exact match domain to our funnels where we generate clients and

867
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,080
customers. and that's what... all right, pk says, good morning! a bit different question. what's

868
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,240
your ai tool stack that you recommend called code max cursor and gemini there are so many changes,

869
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,100
that's hard to determine what's best." all right, so if you go to the ai profit board all right,

870
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,720
once you're in the start here section. so in the start here section, here, if you want to know

871
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,360
what tools i use, i actually have an updated tools list here. i'm not going to share it because

872
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,040
if someone's watching this video, that changes, and we update it as we go along. but if you

873
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,140
want to know what tools i personally use so you don't feel overwhelmed, get it inside the air

874
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:08,720
profit boarding start here post. right what you want to see is that when new updates come out,

875
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,080
i review them. so i spend about 80 hours a week testing, and my team spends about eight hours

876
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,720
a week testing. we condense all those hours of testing into a five-minute update where you can

877
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,440
quickly learn what to focus on here. so for example, like july you can see back in july we broke

878
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,420
down, okay here are the new updates. here's why i've created this. here's my top three most

879
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,640
useful this week. here's some decent stuff, and here's the stuff to completely ignore." right

880
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,700
and so we. break down the most important updates, and then we keep you updated like that. and

881
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,740
that's the best way to stay up to date because you can get the latest tools that i'm using,

882
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,540
my tool stack, and that's updated week to week, day to day. and then also, you get the weekly

883
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,420
updates, which you can feel down to here and just learn what's worth your time and what to skip.

884
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,220
that's some of the best stuff. flatland says, great content! using ai i've created a lot of

885
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,220
real professional stuff. kayak website, awesome for you! good to see you!" and yeah, that's

886
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,340
basically how you can use this stuff, right? so if we go back to notebook i was stuffing great,

887
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,880
like reports. this another cool thing as well. you can actually create infographic and images

888
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,840
can rank really well for particular keywords, right? so if i type in notebook glen asio yes,

889
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,640
we'll rank in on the first page of google for that particular keyword. all right? and also,

890
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,160
my website is ranking first page as well. so this is interesting too, right? this is really

891
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,860
interesting. all right, so we're basically dominating the first page of google because we're

892
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,360
creating videos about that topic, like i showed you how to do with notebook we're creating blog

893
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,780
posts about the topic, like i've shown you to do with notebook right we're actually creating

894
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,700
school posts that rank on the first page as well, which is pretty cool. so it generates traffic

895
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,740
to my community. we also create unique posts and create them and post them on linkedin and then

896
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,140
share that information too. all right? and you can see, for example, if you have a look at this

897
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,280
page, i see how many how much traffic you got. yes you got 128 views, which is not bad. oh there

898
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:49,220
we go! 741 article views, pretty insane, right? so we get a lot of people looking at that content,

899
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,940
and then you can see how easy it is to rank. like another video ranking down there as well.

900
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,460
all right? so you can rank multiple times on the first page google for the keyword that you're

901
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,120
targeting using these methods that i'm showing you today. covered a lot. all right? and then

902
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,800
also, you can create these exact match domains that rank for the tools as well. so that's basically

903
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:08,400
my master class on how to use notebook for aico if you want to get a free seo strategy session,

912
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,500
link in the comments description. google just dropped something crazy with notebook, lm, ultra,

913
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:51,040
this. thing can now handle 600 sources in one notebook. you get watermark-free slide decks and

914
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:56,120
way more power. if you use ai for research or content, this changes everything. let me show

915
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,940
you what just happened. all right, so notebook lm just got a massive upgrade. and i'm talking

916
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:07,180
game-changing stuff here. google put notebook lm inside their ai ultra plan. that's their top-tier

917
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,140
subscription. and when i saw what they added, i had to make this video because if you're doing

918
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,980
research, making content, or building presentations, this update is wild. let me break down

919
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,800
what just happened. and stick around because i'll show you exactly how to use this stuff. so

920
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,920
first, notebook lm is google's ai research tool. you upload sources like pdfs articles, videos,

921
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:35,020
whatever. then it makes summaries, slide decks, infographics, even audio and video overviews.

922
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,800
it's basically an ai research assistant that does all the heavy lifting for you. now here's

923
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:45,740
what changed. google just rolled notebook lm into their ai ultra subscription. this is huge.

924
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:51,340
you now get access to gemini's most powerful models inside notebook lm we're talking the absolute

925
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:57,720
best ai google has. faster processing, smarter outputs, deeper reasoning on everything you feed

926
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,680
it. but the model upgrade is just the start. let's talk about limits. before ultra the free

927
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:09,820
version gave you 50 sources per notebook. the pro version gave you 300. ultra you get 600 sources

928
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:14,320
per notebook. think about that for a second. you can dump entire research libraries into one

929
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:20,550
notebook. hundreds of pdfs dozens of every article you've ever saved, all in one place, all

930
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:26,210
processed by ai this matters because most people hit the source limit fast. you're researching

931
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:32,730
a topic, you add 20 articles, then 30 more, then some pdfs boom you're maxed out. with 600 sources,

932
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:37,150
that problem is gone. you can build massive knowledge bases that actually work. and it's not

933
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:43,950
just sources. ultra massively increases your usage limits across audio overviews, way more video

934
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:49,510
overviews, way more deep research sessions, way more slide deck and infographic generation,

935
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:54,130
way more. google didn't give exact numbers, but they said the increases are huge. we're talking

936
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,590
professional-level capacity here. now let's talk outputs. this is where it gets really good.

937
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:03,050
ultra removes watermarks from your slide decks and infographics. that means when you generate

938
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:07,730
a presentation, it's clean. no google branding, no watermarks, just professional-ready materials

939
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:11,930
you can use in meetings, pitches, client presentations, whatever. you look like you spent hours

940
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:17,390
making it when it took you five minutes. and here's something else. ultra brought back the long

941
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:21,990
option for slide decks. before you could only make short summary decks. now you can generate

942
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:27,070
full, detailed presentations. we're talking comprehensive decks with tons of slides, perfect

943
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:31,790
for lectures, workshops, deep dives, anything where you need real substance. now i want to talk

944
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:38,030
about something. if you're serious about using tools like notebook lm ultra to scale your business,

945

save time, and automate your workflows, you need to check out my ai profit boardroom this. is

949
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:05,290
into actual business results. link is the description. back to it. so who is this for? ultra

950
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:10,990
is built for power users, researchers who need to process tons of information, content creators

951
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:16,910
making videos and courses, business analysts building reports, students handling heavy coursework,

952
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:22,850
anyone who uses notebook lm seriously and hits those limits. if you're casual, the free or pro

953
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:27,850
versions are fine. but if you're doing real work, ultra is the move. say you're a student writing

954
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:33,110
a thesis. you've got 100 sources to review: books, journals, articles, interviews. you dump

955
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:37,790
them all into ultra then you ask notebook lm to summarize each source, pull out key quotes,

956
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:42,850
find connections between sources, generate an audio overview you can listen to while driving,

957
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:47,590
then create an infographic showing how all the ideas connect. all of that happens automatically.

958
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:53,410
you just saved yourself weeks of work. all right, so how do you get ultra you need to subscribe

959
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:59,850
to google's ai ultra plan. this is their premium tier. it includes ultra access for notebook

960
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:05,790
lm plus their other ai tools. you can't just buy notebook lm ultra by itself. it's part of the

961
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:10,790
whole package. google is bundling everything together. smart move on their part. now let me

962
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:16,010
give you some pro tips for using ultra first maximize your sources. don't just add a few articles.

963
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:21,230
go deep. add everything relevant. the more sources you add, the better notebook lm understands

964
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:26,410
your topic. it can make connections across sources, pull insights from multiple places, give

965
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:33,030
you way outputs. second customize your video and audio overviews. you can give notebook lm specific

966
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,070
prompts. tell it what angle to focus on, what tone to use, what points to emphasize. don't just

967
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:43,250
hit generate and hope for the best. guide it. you'll get way better results. third use long

968
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:48,670
slide decks for anything serious: client pitches, lectures, training materials, workshops. the

969
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:53,370
long format gives you real depth. you're not stuck with surface-level summaries. you get comprehensive

970
01:04:53,370 --> 01:05:00,170
presentations that actually deliver value. fourth experiment with deep research. this feature

971
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:06,110
lets notebook lm dive into specific questions. it pulls from all your sources, synthesizes information,

972
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:11,150
gives you detailed answers with citations. it's like having a research assistant that actually

973
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:16,470
knows your material. fifth combined features. don't just use one thing. generate a slide deck,

974
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:21,670
then make a video overview explaining the deck. then create an infographic summarizing the key

975
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:27,110
points. then use deep research to answer questions people might have. stack these features together

976
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:33,390
and you've got a complete content system. here's the thing. notebook lm ultra isn't just a note-taking

977
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:38,310
tool anymore. it's a full research and content engine. you can feed it massive amounts of information,

978
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:44,130
then turn that information into every format you need: presentations, videos, audio, infographics,

979
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:49,630
reports. all professional quality, all fast, all automated. and because you're using gemini's

980
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:54,410
best models, the quality is top tier. the summaries are accurate, the presentations make sense,

981
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:59,210
the overviews sound natural. it's not just spitting out generic ai slop. it's actually processing

982
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:04,170
your specific sources and creating useful outputs. now i know some people are thinking, is this

983
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:08,470
worth paying for? here's my take. if you're doing serious research or content work, yes. the

984
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:13,050
time you save pays for itself immediately. think about how long it takes to read 100 sources,

985
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:18,690
pull out key points, create a presentation, write a script, make an infographic. you're looking

986
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:23,630
at days or weeks of work. ultra does it in minutes. the roi is obvious. but if you're just taking

987
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:28,230
notes or doing light research, maybe not. the free version or pro might be enough. ultra is

988
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:33,610
for people who need scale, who hit limits, who are building real projects with ai one more thing.

989
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:39,050
ultra gives you priority access to new features. when google releases something new for notebook

990
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:44,070
lm ultra users get it first. that's huge. if you want to stay ahead, you're not waiting months

991
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:50,090
for features to roll out. you get them. so bottom line. notebook lm ultra is a massive upgrade:

992
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:57,190
600 sources, better models, higher limits, professional outputs, watermark removal, long slide

993
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:02,870
decks. this turns notebook lm from a nice tool into a serious productivity weapon. if you're

994
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:07,370
doing research, creating content, or building presentations, this is worth checking out. now

995

1003
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:55,910
38,000 members who are crashing it with ai it's completely free, and you'll learn how to use

1004
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:02,070
tools like notebook lm along with everything else in ai right now, notebook lm went from cute

1005
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:07,190
note-taking app to absolute monster. they twinix the customization limit, and it's completely

1006
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:12,190
free. i'm about to show you how to turn your boring documents into genius-level ai assistants.

1007
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:17,970
this is wild. all right, so december 4th, 2025, google quietly released an update that's going

1008
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:23,310
to change everything. notebook lm just expanded their chat customization from 500 characters

1009
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:27,570
to 10,000 characters. and i know what you're thinking: who cares about character limits, right?

1010
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:32,290
wrong this is massive because now you can turn notebook lm into basically any expert you want:

1011
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:37,930
product managers, teachers, scientists, seo specialists, whatever. you and it grounds every

1012
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:44,230
response in your document. so no hallucinations, no made-up facts, just pure accurate insights

1013
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:49,170
from your own sources. let me show you why this is absolutely insane. before this update, you

1014
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:54,290
had 500 characters to describe what you wanted. that's like two sentences. you couldn't build

1015
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:59,270
detailed personas. you couldn't set specific formats. you couldn't create real expert-level

1016
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:05,130
assistants. now 10 000 characters, that's enough to build incredibly detailed instructions with

1017
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:09,970
specific tone of voice, exact output formats, constraints, and rules. everything you need to

1018
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:14,290
make ai actually useful. and here's the best part: it's completely free. no credit card, no

1019
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:20,010
subscription. just go to notebooklm.google.com, and you're ready. now let me show you three

1020
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:24,150
examples that google shared when they announced this update. and i'm going to demo these live

1021
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:29,690
so you can see exactly how powerful this is. first example is a ruthless product manager. this

1022
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:34,130
persona gives you decision memos. it looks at your documents and tells you what's actually going

1023
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:39,210
on with user evidence, feasibility checks, blind spots you missed, and contradictions in your

1024
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:44,390
data. it's like having a senior pm review everything you upload. second example is a middle

1025
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:50,330
school teacher. this one breaks down complex topics into kid-friendly explanations. it gives

1026
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:56,210
you analogies, vocabulary lists, and true or false quizzes. perfect for educators or anyone

1027
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:01,650
learning new subjects. third example is a scientific researcher. this persona analyzes papers

1028
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:07,330
with academic rigor, giving you key findings, methodological strengths and weaknesses, and contradictions

1029
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:13,390
with proper citations. it's phd level analysis without the phd now i'm going to show you these

1030
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:19,610
in action. but first, let me tell you how to access this. go to notebooklm.google.com and upload

1031
01:10:19,610 --> 01:10:24,670
your documents: pdfs text files, whatever you have. then click the gear icon in the chat, and

1032
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:29,610
you'll see a custom prompt field. that's where the magic happens. that field now supports 10,000

1033
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:34,510
characters instead of 500, and that's where you paste these detailed persona prompts. all right,

1034
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:38,790
let me show you demo number one: the product manager persona. before i show you these demos,

1035
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:43,450
let me tell you about something that will take your ai skills to the next level. it's called

1036
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:48,390
ai profit boardroom and if. you're watching this video because you want to save time and work

1037
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:53,870
smarter with ai tools like notebook lm you need to check this out. artificial intelligence profit

1038
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:59,510
boardroom. teaches you how to automate your business processes using the latest ai tools. we're

1039
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:04,570
talking about saving hours every single day, streamlining your workflows, and getting more done

1040
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:09,050
with less effort. and the best part? you learn from real examples and practical strategies that

1041
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:14,090
actually work. no theory, no fluff, just actionable steps you can implement immediately. if

1042
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:18,910
you want to master tools like notebook lm and dozens of other ai platforms that can transform

1043
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:23,690
how you work, click the link in the description. ai profit boardroom is waiting for you. now

1044
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:30,210
back to these insane demos. okay product manager persona. i uploaded a sample roadmap document,

1045
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:35,150
just a basic product features list. now i'm pasting the exact prompt that google shared. it

1046
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:39,970
tells the ai to act as a ruthless product manager where every response must be a decision memo

1047
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:45,870
with user evidence bullets, feasibility checks, blind spots, and contradictions in a very specific

1048
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,830
format. now i'm asking it to review the q3 features, and watch what happens. boom it gives me

1049
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:55,530
a full decision memo. the user evidence section shows which features customers actually ask

1050
01:11:55,530 --> 01:12:00,390
for. feasibility checks highlight which ones are realistic versus pipe dreams. the blind spots

1051
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:04,610
section points out what we're missing, and contradictions it found two features that directly

1052
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:09,590
conflict with each other. this is insane. i just uploaded a document and got instant expert-level

1053
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:14,350
analysis. no back and forth, no vague responses, just actionable insights. and this works because

1054
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:19,470
the ai is grounded actual document. it's not making stuff up. it's analyzing what i gave it.

1055
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:26,170
okay demo 2: the middle school teacher persona. i grabbed a science textbook section about photosynthesis.

1056
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:31,830
it's way too complex for most kids. i pasted the teacher prompt, which tells the ai to simplify

1057
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:38,050
everything, give analogies, create vocabulary lists, and add quizzes. i ask it to explain photosynthesis,

1058
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:43,870
and look at this output. first a tldr summary that's super simple: just plants make food using

1059
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:49,270
sunlight. then an analogy where photosynthesis is like a factory kitchen. the leaves of the

1060
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:54,710
kitchen, sunlight is the electricity, water and carbon dioxide are the ingredients, and glucose

1061
01:12:54,710 --> 01:13:00,030
is the meal they cook. brilliant then a vocabulary list with chlorophyll, glucose, and stomata,

1062
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:05,350
each term explained in simple language. and at the end, a true or false quiz asking if plants

1063
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:10,930
need sunlight to make food. this is perfect for educators or anyone trying to learn. it breaks

1064
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:16,270
everything down, makes it digestible, and adds interactive elements, all from one prompt. now

1065
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:21,850
demo 3: the scientific researcher persona. i uploaded two biology research papers with dense

1066
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:27,670
academic stuff, methodology sections, and statistical analysis, the works. i pasted the researcher

1067
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:33,250
prompt, which demands formal academic analysis with key findings, with bold headers, strengths

1068
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:38,450
and weaknesses, and contradictions with citations. i ask about the methodology, and watch this.

1069
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:43,650
it gives me a structured breakdown with a bold section for key findings that lists the main

1070
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:48,410
methodological approaches from both papers. then a bold section for methodological strengths

1071
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:53,990
that points out robust sample sizes, proper control groups, and valid statistical tests. then

1072
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:59,750
a bold section for weaknesses that highlights potential confounding variables and limited generalizability.

1073
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:04,730
then the best part: a bold section for contradictions. it compares both papers and shows where

1074
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:10,690
they disagree with exact citations. paper one claims x paper two claims y and these contradict

1075
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:16,230
on this specific point. this is phd level analysis, and i got it in 30 seconds. now here's what

1076
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:20,890
makes this update so powerful. you can adapt these prompts for anything. marketing create an

1077
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:26,350
seo auditor persona that reviews your content, finds keyword gaps, and suggests improvements.

1078
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:31,550
legal make a contract analyze a persona that highlights risky clauses and suggests revisions.

1079
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:37,350
finance build a budget analyst persona that spots overspending and recommends cuts. the possibilities

1080
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:42,370
are endless. and because you're uploading your own documents, the ai stays accurate. it can't

1081
01:14:42,370 --> 01:14:47,290
hallucinate facts. it can't make up data. everything comes from your sources. let me show you

1082
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:52,850
this table that breaks down the three sample personas. product manager is best for ruthless

1083
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:57,810
insights and needs about 800 characters minimum to define the structure. middle school teacher

1084
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:03,320
is perfect for kid-friendly explanations. with around 700 characters, plus quiz rules. scientific

1085
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:08,580
researcher is ideal for objective analysis, with about 900 characters for proper formality.

1086
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:13,920
all of these fit comfortably in the new 10,000 character limit. so you can go way more detailed

1087
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,500
if you want. now let me give you some real-world use cases. if you're a content creator, build

1088
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:23,880
a video script reviewer where you upload your outlines and ask the ai to critique structure,

1089
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:29,420
pacing, and hooks. if you're a student, create an exam prep tutor where you upload your textbooks

1090
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:35,040
and get custom quizzes and study guides. if you're a business professional, make a contradiction

1091
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:41,100
finder where you upload reports from different departments and let the ai spot inconsistencies.

1092
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:46,460
this tool pairs with gemini 3; that's google's latest ai model. so you're getting cutting-edge

1093
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:51,800
performance for free. now here's a pro tip: don't use vague queries. the more specific your

1094
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:56,600
question, the better the response. instead of asking, to tell me about this document," ask,

1095
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:02,060
what are the three main contradictions in the methodology section?" for specifics and get better

1096
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:06,780
outputs. another tip is to copy and paste the exact prompts google shared. i'll link them in

1097
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,540
the description. start with those, test them, see how they work, then adapt them for your needs.

1098
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:16,100
change the tone, adjust the format, add your own constraints, and make it yours. and here's

1099
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,220
the biggest mistake people make: they forget to upload sources first. notebook lm needs documents

1100
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:26,000
to ground its responses. if you just chat without sources, you're wasting the main feature.

1101
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,420
always upload first, then customize your persona, then start asking questions. that's the workflow.

1102
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:36,040
now let's talk about why this matters. most ai tools are generic. chat gpt gives you generic

1103
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:41,080
responses. claude gives you generic responses. they try to be everything to everyone. notebook

1104
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:45,660
lm is different. it's an ai that becomes exactly what you need based on your documents, based

1105
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:50,300
on your instructions, based on your goals. it's personalized ai without the personalization

1106
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,300
tax. and with this 10,000 character limit, you can get incredibly specific. the old limit let

1107
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,980
you say, act like a teacher." the new limit lets you say, act like a middle school science teacher

1108
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:05,660
who uses pop culture references, breaks concepts into three-step processes, and ends every explanation

1109
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:10,240
with a quiz question that reinforces the core concept." see the difference? the old version

1110
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:16,000
was a suggestion. the new version is a complete persona with style, with structure, with rules.

1111
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,320
that's what 10,000 characters unlocks: real customization, real expertise, real value. and again,

1112
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,740
this is free. google isn't charging for this; they're just giving it away. google says, here

1113
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:31,400
take it. no credit card required." that's insane. now here's what you need to do right now:

1114
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,740
go to notebooklm.google.com and create an account. if you don't have one, upload a document

1115
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:41,580
you work with regularly. could be a report, a research paper, a client brief, whatever. and

1116
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,960
then go to the chat settings, click the gear icon, find the custom prompt field, and paste one

1117
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,280
of those sample prompts i showed you: product manager, teacher, researcher. pick one, test it,

1118
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,600
and ask a question about your doc. see what happens. you're going to be blown away because you're

1119
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,580
going to get expert-level insights from a free tool in about two minutes. and once you see how

1120
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:06,020
it works, start customizing. build your personas. create an seo expert, a legal advisor, a data

1121
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:11,180
analyst, whatever you need. the 10 000 character limit gives you room to be creative, to be

1122
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:16,240
specific, to build something actually useful. this isn't hype. this is a legitimate game changer,

1123
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:22,080
especially for people who work with lots of documents: researchers, students, business professionals,

1124
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:27,220
content creators, anyone who needs to extract insights from text. notebook lm just became your

1125
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:32,140
secret weapon. and with this update, it went from good to incredible. all right, before you

1126
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:37,880
go, one more thing about AI profit boardroom. if watching this demo got you excited about what's

possible with AI tools, you need to join because notebook lm is just one tool. there are dozens

1133
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,320
regret it. what if i told you that you could turn a 50-page report into a video, a slide deck,

1134
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,840
an infographic, and a full research paper in under 10 minutes? no design skills needed, no hours

1135
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,580
in powerpoint just click a button and it's done. today i'm showing you how notebook lm just

1136
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:29,560
became the most powerful content creation tool for seo and it's going to change everything.

1137
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,400
this is brand new. this is huge. and if you're still making content the old way, you're already

1138
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:39,880
behind. so notebook lm dropped four massive updates, and i'm not talking about small tweaks.

1139
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,300
i'm talking about features that turn this simple note-taking app into a full content studio.

1140
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:50,480
we're talking slide decks, infographics, deep research that searches hundreds of websites for

1141
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,260
you, and custom video styles that make your content look professional without touching a single

1142
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:00,000
design tool. let me break down what's actually happening here. notebook lm used to be just an

1143
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,620
AI assistant that helped you summarize documents. you'd upload a pdf and it would give you notes.

1144
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:10,180
that was it. but now, now it's completely different. you can upload your sources: pdfs google

1145
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:17,500
docs spreadsheets, even images of handwritten notes. and notebook lm builds an entire knowledge

1146
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:23,620
base from all of it. then here's where it gets crazy. from that same knowledge base, you can

1147
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:28,980
generate slides for a presentation, an infographic for social media, a video for youtube and

1148
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:33,960
a full research report with citations, all from the same sources you upload. your content, click

1149
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:38,320
slide deck, and boom! you get a full presentation ready to go. no manual work, no designing

1150
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,340
each slide, no copying and pasting bullet points. it's done. and the best part? the slides stick

1151
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:48,220
to your original content. they don't make stuff up. they don't hallucinate. they pull straight

1152
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,820
from your sources. so if you're doing client presentations, or webinars, or teaching a class,

1153
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:58,840
you just saved hours of work. the second update is infographics. these are visual summaries

1154
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:03,560
of complex information. you can choose if you want it vertical for instagram horizontal for

1155
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,680
a blog post, or square for linkedin you can control the colors, the layout, the number of key

1156
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:13,220
points, all through prompts. you just type what you want, and notebook lm creates it. this takes

1157
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:18,560
what used to be hours in canva or photoshop and turns it into seconds. you're going from research

1158
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,620
to design to share in literally minutes. now here's where it gets really interesting. the third

1159
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:29,040
update is deep research. this is wild. you give notebook lm a topic, it goes out and browses

1160
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,880
hundreds of websites. it compiles everything, it synthesizes the information, and it gives you

1161
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:39,120
back a structured report with citations, all automatically. and remember, you can also upload

1162
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,140
google sheets word docs, images, whatever you have. so you're building this massive knowledge

1163
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:49,800
base, and notebook lm is doing all the heavy lifting for seo research. game changer for school

1164
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,640
projects, unbeatable for content planning. this is what you've been waiting for. and one more

1165
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:59,080
thing: if you're creating all this content with notebook lm but nobody is finding it online,

1166
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:03,960

1208
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:51,830
the video slides, narration, everything. and here's the beautiful part: all four of these pieces

1209
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:58,210
of content came from the same research, the same sources, the same knowledge base. so now you've

1210
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:03,290

1212
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:15,330
tool. and this same exact process works for any topic: meal prep, sleep optimization, trip planning,

1213
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:19,910
fitness routines, marketing strategies, whatever your niche is. the workflow is the same. you

1214
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:24,110
start with deep research, then you generate your slide deck, then your infographic, then your

1215
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:29,810
video. same sources, multiple formats, maximum reach. and you didn't need design skills. you

1216
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:34,910
didn't need video editing. you just needed notebook lm and good prompts. here's the bottom line:

1217
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:40,530
notebook lm went from being a simple summarization tool to a full content creation studio. slide

1218
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:46,130
decks, infographics, deep research, custom style video overviews, it's all there, and it's changing

1219
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:50,570
how we make content. if you're serious about content creation, if you're serious about research,

1220
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:55,350
if you're serious about building an online presence, you need to try this workflow yourself.

1221
01:26:55,350 --> 01:27:01,130
upload a document, let notebook lm build you a slide deck, an infographic, video, all in under

1222
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,670
10 minutes, then polish it and publish it. and one more thing: if you're creating all this content

1223
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:10,170
with notebook lm but nobody is finding it online, you've got a traffic problem. that's where

1224
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:14,590
seo comes in. if you want more leads, more traffic, and more sales, my team can help you rank

1225
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:20,050
higher on google check the link in the comments and description to order aico online and let

1226
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:24,310
us handle your backlinks while you focus on growing your business. google just rolled out two

1227
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:30,010
massive features to notebook lm infographics and slide, and they're powered by something called

1228
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:36,790
nano banana pro this. is google's gemini 3 image model built right into notebook lm what does

1229
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:42,110
this mean for you? you can now take any notes, any pdfs any documents you have, and turn them

1230
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:46,790
into professional visual content. we're talking charts, timelines, icons, full presentation

1231
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:52,350
slides, all generated automatically. no design skills needed, no expensive software. just upload

1232
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:56,950
your stuff and let the ai do the work. now before i show you exactly how this works, let me

1233
01:27:56,950 --> 01:28:01,910
explain why this is such a big deal. most ai image generators just make random pretty pictures.

1234
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:06,670
they don't understand your content. they don't care about accuracy. but, nano, banana, pro.

1235
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:11,290
is different. it actually reads your sources. it understands your research. it creates visuals

1236
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:16,830
that match your specific content. so if you upload a report about sales data, it makes charts

1237
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:22,430
about sales data. if you upload notes about history, it creates relevant timelines. everything

1238
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:27,350
is based on what you actually uploaded. that's the game changer here. let me walk you through

1239
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:33,450
the infographics feature first. you go to notebook lm you upload your documents, notes, pdfs

1240
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:38,630
whatever you've got. then you click on the new infographics option. the ai reads through everything.

1241
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:43,370
it identifies the key points. it figures out what visuals would work best, and boom! you've

1242
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:48,210
got a professional infographic: charts showing your data, icons representing your concepts,

1243
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:53,030
timelines organizing your information, sleek layouts that actually look good. and here's the

1244
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:58,350
crazy part: you can customize everything. change the colors to match your brand, adjust the

1245
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:03,170
fonts, rearrange the layout, make it exactly what you need. then export it as a pdf or image.

1246
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:08,250
use it in reports, presentations, social media, whatever. the slide deck feature works the same

1247
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:13,470
way. upload your content, click the slide deck option. notebook lm generates an entire presentation

1248
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:19,290
for professional slides, clean design, your content organized perfectly. and just like the infographics,

1249
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:25,270
you can customize everything, then export to google slides or pdf ready to present immediately.

1250

1261
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:28,410
for. students can turn study notes into visual study guides. educators can create lecture presentations

without hiring designers. business professionals can turn reports into engaging presentations.

1264
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:43,350
anyone who needs to communicate information visually just got a massive upgrade. and remember,

1265
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:47,430
this is all free right now. you don't need notebook lm pro. you don't need to pay anything.

1266
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:52,850
just go to notebook lm google and start using it. let me give you some specific use cases so

1267
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:57,690
you can see how powerful this really is. say you're a student studying for exams. you've got

1268
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:02,950
pages and notes. upload them to notebook lm generate an infographic that summarizes everything

1269
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:08,070
visually. suddenly your study material is way easier to remember because our brains love visual

1270
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:11,830
information. or say you're a teacher preparing a lesson. you've got your lesson plan written

1271
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:18,270
out. upload it to notebook lm generate a slide deck. now you've got a full presentation ready

1272
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,890
to go with visuals that help students understand the concepts better. or maybe you're pitching

1273
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:31,830
a client. you've got graphics showing the market opportunity. generate slides for your pitch

1274
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:36,970
deck. now you look incredibly professional, and it took you maybe 20 minutes total. the productivity

1275
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:42,150
boost here is massive. things that used to take hours now take minutes, and the quality is actually

1276
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:46,690
good. this isn't some janky ai output that looks amateur. these are professional grade visuals.

1277
01:31:46,690 --> 01:31:50,770
now here's something most people don't realize yet. you can combine this with other notebook

1278
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:55,490
lm features. remember notebook lm already does audio overviews. it can turn your notes into

1279
01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:00,030
podcast style summaries. now you can do visual overviews too. so you could take the same source

1280
01:32:00,030 --> 01:32:04,810
material and create an audio version for listening, a visual infographic for quick reference,

1281
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:10,430
and a slide deck for presenting. three different formats from one upload. that's insane efficiency,

1282
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:15,450
and it all stays synced because it's from the same sources. let me talk about nano banana pro

1283
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:20,390
for a second. this is what's powering everything behind the scenes. it's google's latest image

1284
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:26,130
generation model, part of the gemini 3 family. and what makes it special is how it handles source

1285
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:31,350
material. most ai image generators work like this: you give them a text prompt, they make an

1286
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:36,090
image based on that prompt, but they don't really understand context. they're just pattern matching.

1287
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:41,630
nano banana pro is different. it actually processes your documents, reads the text, understands

1288
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:46,970
the relationships between ideas, then generates images that accurately represent that information.

1289
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:52,110
so if your document talks about a process with five steps, it creates a visual showing those

1290
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:56,730
five steps in order. if you've got data comparing three different things, it makes a chart comparing

1291
01:32:56,730 --> 01:33:01,650
those three things. the accuracy is what sets it apart, and that's why these visuals are actually

1292
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:05,770
useful instead of just decorative. now let me give you some tips for getting the best results.

1293
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:10,450
first organize your sources before uploading. the clearer your input, the better your output.

1294
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:16,230
if you upload a messy pile of random notes, you'll get messy visuals. but if you upload well-organized

1295
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:21,830
information, the ai has clear material to work with. they second use the customization options.

1296
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:27,070
don't just accept the first version the ai generates. adjust colors to match your brand. rearrange

1297
01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:32,570
elements to emphasize what matters most. the ai gives you a great starting point, but you can

1298
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:37,950
make it perfect. third export in the right format for your use case. need to edit more later?

1299
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:43,550
export to google slides need a final version? to export to pdf need. something for social media?

1300
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:48,390
export as an image. pick the format that makes sense for what you're doing. fourth don't overthink

1301
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:53,050
it. just start creating. upload something and see what happens. the interface is super simple.

1302
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:57,810
you'll figure it out in five minutes, and because it's free, there's zero risk to experimenting.

1303
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:03,670
right let me talk about some advanced strategies. one thing you can do is create a content library.

1304
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:13,150
every time you research a topic, upload it. to now you've got a visual content library you can

1305
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:18,150
pull from anytime. need a quick social post? grab an infographic. need slides for a meeting?

1306
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:22,870
you've already got them ready. this is especially powerful if you work in a specific niche.

1307
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:28,290
build up your library over time, and you'll always have relevant visuals ready to go. another

1308
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:33,690
strategy is batch creation. set aside one hour per week. upload everything you've worked on

1309
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:39,210
that week. generate all your visuals at once. way more efficient than doing it one at a time

1310
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:44,550
as you need it. you can also use this for client work. if you're an agency or freelancer, this

1311
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:50,570
is a goldmine. clients love visual deliverables. use notebook lm to create professional looking

1312
01:34:50,570 --> 01:34:55,570
reports and presentations. your clients think you spent hours on design work. reality is, you

1313
01:34:55,570 --> 01:35:00,490
spent 10 minutes uploading their data and letting ai do the heavy lifting. that's how you scale

1314
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:05,290
without hiring a design team. one more thing about the integration with google's ecosystem.

1315
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:10,110
since this exports to google slides it plays nice with everything else you're probably already

1316
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:16,150
using. easy to collaborate with team members. easy to present in meetings. easy to share with

1317
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:21,270
clients. everything just works together. no weird file format issues. no compatibility problems.

1318
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:25,630
just smooth integration. now i know some of you are thinking, what's the catch? there's got

1319
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:30,050
to be limitations, right? honestly not many. the main thing is you need good source material.

1320
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:35,290
garbage in, garbage out. if you upload poorly written notes, the ai can't magically fix that.

1321
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:39,150
but if you give it decent content to work with, the results are excellent. the other thing is

1322
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:44,370
this is still new. google just rolled this out, so there might be some bugs or quirks as they

1323
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:49,270
work through things. but from what i've tested so far, it's pretty solid. way better than i

1324
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:54,210
expected for a free tool. here's what i think is coming next. right now, you can do infographics

1325
01:35:54,210 --> 01:36:00,110
and slides. i bet google adds more formats soon. maybe social media graphics optimized for different

1326
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:05,510
platforms. maybe video thumbnails. maybe even short form video content. they're clearly investing

1327
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:10,510
heavily in making notebook lm a complete visual content creation tool, not just a note-taking

1328
01:36:10,510 --> 01:36:15,190
app anymore. and with nano banana pro behind it, they've got the technology to do pretty much

1329
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:20,010
anything visual. so expect more features rolling out over the next few months. now before i

1330
01:36:20,010 --> 01:36:25,660
wrap up, i want to hit one more time on why this. we're living in a world where visual content

1331
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:30,580
is everything. social media, presentations, reports, education, marketing, everything needs

1332
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:36,860
visuals. but creating good visuals used to require design skills or hiring designers. that barrier

1333
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:42,060
just disappeared. anyone can now create professional visual content. students competing with

1334
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:47,160
other students. creators competing with other creators. businesses competing with other businesses.

1335
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:52,880
if you're not using tools like this, you're falling behind because your is using them, and they're

1336
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,920
creating better content faster than you. that's just reality. so the question isn't whether

1337
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:01,240
to use these tools. the question is how fast can you learn them and implement them? and with

1338
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:05,640
notebook lm being this easy and this free, there's no excuse not to start today. all right,

1339
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:10,540
last thing before i go. if you're serious about staying ahead with ai tools and want to learn

1340

is the best place to learn how to leverage ai automation for real business results. link is

1349
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:01,240
in the description below. trust me, if you're watching this video, you need to be in that community.

1350
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:08,180
notebook lm has just given you the ability to automate slides, infographics, and podcasts from

1351
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:14,220
anything in like under 60 seconds. so i'm gonna show you exactly how this works, how to use

1352
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:19,160
notebook lm and how to create these crazy infographics like you can see right here. plus how

1353
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:25,220
to create these absolutely insane presentations in one single click. you can see here we've

1354
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:31,200
got a full designed presentation step by step, and i literally just automated it before this

1355
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:36,340
live stream in one click. it was ridiculous. now if you've never used this before, i'm going

1356
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:42,020
to talk you through how notebook lm works. so don't worry. just dropped. it's free. it's brand

1357
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:46,380
new. and when i saw what it could do, i pretty much had to go live immediately because if you're

1358
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,120
a business owner who creates any kind of content, presentations, guides, trainings, client materials,

1359
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:56,700
this is about to save you hours every single week. and the other thing about this is you don't

1360
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,800
need any design skills. you don't need to use canva you don't need any powerpoint you don't

1361
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,840
need to hire anyone. you just upload yourself, click a button, and it gives you a finished slide

1362
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,420
deck with infographics, charts, and professional designs. or an infographic that explains your

1363
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:16,200
process in one image. or a podcast where two ai hosts can discuss your content like it's a real

1364
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,840
radio show. or from your existing documents, sources, youtube videos, whatever you want to plug

1365
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:26,060
in. it's all completely free. now here's why it matters for you specifically. okay if you've

1366
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:30,360
ever felt overwhelmed by all the ai tools out there, if you've tried stuff before and it didn't

1367
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:35,400
work, if you don't have time to learn complicated tech, this is different. it's simple. it works.

1368
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,780
i'm going to show you exactly how to use it step by step, so stay until the end because i'm

1369
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:44,880
also going to give you my prompts, my workflows, and some custom automations you can copy inside

1370
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,720
the video notes. let's get straight into it. okay so what you can see here, this is notebook

1371
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:55,480
lm you can get free access at notebooklm.google.com. and to make it as simple as possible, all

1372
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:59,740
you do is you go to create a new notebook like you can see right here. and then you can upload

1373
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:03,640
sources. so for example, you can copy and paste tags. you can add a link. you can add a website,

1374
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:08,340
google drive doc. you can have multiple different sources. in fact, you can actually add 300

1375
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:15,220
different sources, which is pretty wild. so what i'm going to show you exactly today is a step-by-step

1376
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:21,280
guide for the process described in this video as psx has requested. all right, so if you want

1377
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,600
to get access to this, you can get it at notebook lm and then for example, we can grab a video

1378
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:30,940
from a youtube channel or any source you want to paste in. let's take something brand new, like

1379
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:35,720
for example called opus 4 5 which you know most of the internet doesn't have much information

1380
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:40,580
on yet because it literally just came out 24 hours ago. we can paste in a youtube source like

1381
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:46,300
so, and that's going to load up a new notebook right now. inside that notebook, we are custom

1382
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:51,040
training it on our information and our sources. okay you see that example right here? we've

1383
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:55,820
got the source loaded on the left-hand side. then we have this custom gpt and then if we want,

1384
01:40:55,820 --> 01:41:01,240
i mean, it's basically a notebook. and then inside here, we can just click this and this, and

1385
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,920
literally in one click, what we are generating is an audio view, a video view, some flash cards,

1386
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:10,320
a quiz, an infographic, and a slide deck all in one single click. all right, and you can automate

1387
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,340
all of those literally instantly just by loading in the source and then quickly creating these.

1388
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:18,740
now you might be wondering, okay, what's the quality of these? what do they look like? here's

1389
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:23,820
one i actually created earlier. so if we go back to notebook lm here, we can go over to building

1390
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:28,740
applications with google's new ai stack. you can see i've loaded in some information and sources

1391
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:35,320
about google's ai stack over here. and then if we click on this example, as you can see, what

1392
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:41,620
you can see here is a custom infographic, very detailed. and the difference here, you may not

1393
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:47,520
notice this, but the difference here is that you've never been able to create an infographic

1394
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,420
as detailed as this, as well designed as this, with perfect text. look at the icon, for example.

1395
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:56,900
you got smashed up laptop there with the excuse these tools probably don't work well. we've

1396
01:41:56,900 --> 01:42:01,680
talked about the old limiting beliefs versus the new limiting beliefs that help you build stuff

1397
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:07,420
and automate stuff with ai right? and so you can see how quick and easy it is now to generate

1398
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:12,180
these custom built infographics as well as video views, podcasts, and everything else. and you

1399
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:17,500
can do this for free. it's absolutely mind-blowing. so if you've never done this before, definitely

1400
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:21,640
check it out. now i'm going to show you some other cool stuff that you can do and also have

1401
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:25,720
a look at the outputs from opus so you can see we've already got a quiz ready, already got the

1402
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:29,860
flashcards ready, and we are just going to have to wait a couple of minutes for the rest of

1403
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,560
this to be automated and built. and this is the thing, if you've not realized this already,

1404
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:40,460
right now notebook 11 google's technology in general, i would say it's a total level above everyone

1405
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:45,760
else's because if you were using ai a few years ago, you know that google was way behind everyone

1406
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,780
else. whereas now, what they're creating is something that is pretty much changing the internet,

1407
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:55,500
right? and changing the way that we learn, changing the way that we create content is absolutely

1408
01:42:55,500 --> 01:43:00,740
mind-blowing. now if you want to know, okay, what are all the new key features? because i know

1409
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:05,220
a lot of you are using notebook lm already. you already understand it. you're already like,

1410
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:10,080
okay, what's actually new in november 2025? so let me talk you through that. these notes are

1411
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,820
inside the air profit boardroom. so if you want to go and grab that, you can just go to the

1412
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:18,240
air profit boardroom in the link in the comments description. go to the classroom or just go

1413
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:23,360
to airprofitboarding com and then. from here, what you're going to do is go to sop updates,

1414
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:27,540
as you can see. and then we've got november 2025. this gets updated every day. so you've got

1415
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:33,100
25th there with opus we've got 23, 22, etc. right and if you scroll down, you can see we've

1416
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:38,340
got the key notes and features here. so one of the biggest new updates, and this is due to nano

1417
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:43,580
banana, which is a brand new image update from notebook. and you can see that we can now turn

1418
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:48,540
documents into visual infographics powered by nano banana. what do they look like? they look

1419
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:52,560
like this. how do you automate them? you just go up here. so you load in your source inside

1420
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,140
notebook lm and then you are going to click infographic over here, and this generates an infographic

1421
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:01,900
for you. all right, now if you want to see what the infographic looks like, so i literally just

1422
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:06,780
clicked generate, as you saw a couple of minutes ago. then you can see that right here inside

1423
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:12,080
this section, right? and see for ai showdown, claude opus versus gemini 3 pro, the comparison

1424
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:17,420
based on initial hands-on testing, the powerful record opus and a top competitor. and then you

1425
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:21,900
can see the head-to-head verdict with this infographic. it is mind-blowing. now you can share

1426
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:26,740
that. you can download that. you can go full screen on it, and you can use this on social media,

1427
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:32,400
for example. so for example, we wanted to use this. what we could do is just download that image

1428
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:37,000
over here. then we can go over to whatever social media platform you prefer. so i'm just going

1429
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:43,160
to do this x for example. then we're going to upload the image of the infographic we just created,

1430
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:55,560
and we can say claude opus 4 5. versus versus gemini 3 pro. who wins? here's my take and plus

1431
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:01,220
our success right. and you can see that we can easily create not just the infographic itself

1432
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:06,040
in one click. but we can also generate social media content that we could post on linkedin on

1433
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:09,760
facebook and in any sort of platform where you're trying to reach a lot of people, right? and

1434
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:14,720
if you have questions as we go along, this is live, so feel free to ask, and i will be happy

1435
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:19,020
to help you. all right, so we go back to this infographic as well. you can zoom in, you zoom

1436
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:23,080
out, but you can actually read the text. you can see the text is pretty much perfect, right?

1437
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:30,100
so this is using nano banana pro which is the new update from google and it's integrated inside

1438
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:34,320
notebook lm so all you do is you click a button. boom shakalaka! you've got an infographic ready

1439
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:38,620
to go. i just love the design of this. i love the way it's laid out. i actually think it's better

1440
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:42,780
than most designers. it's better than most infographics i've paper in the past, and you can

1441
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:48,100
just automate it in one click. all right, that's just one single update from notebook lm in

1442
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,160
november 2025. let's have a look at the rest of the stuff. all right, so we also got slide deck.

1443
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:57,320
so we can create comprehensive and complete presentations from our sources, customized to our

1444
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:02,700
source in one single click. how do we do that? so if we go back here, we'll go back inside notebook

1445
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:07,220
lm we're gonna x off that and then scroll down, and you can see this is generating the slide

1446
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:10,920
deck. so i'm going to go to a previous one i've generated. it does take a bit longer to create

1447
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,560
a slide deck because they have so much detail inside them. and you can see i've generated a

1448
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,500
few different ones over here. so each time this generates, this should be unique as well. so

1449
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:23,480
for example, here we've got build your business with google's new ai slide. that's actually

1450
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,720
an infographic. we've actually got a presentation over here. i'm going to go full screen on

1451
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:32,480
that. we can actually start and play the slideshow as well. and you can see here that based

1452
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:37,400
on my video that i generated and loaded into notebook lm it's taken the whole transcript and

1453
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:41,500
then created a beautiful presentation about it, right? so you can see here it says, google just

1454
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,480
dropped gemini and it's changing everything. here's the google ai building stack: how to build

1455
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:50,560
apps, automate work, and create infinite minutes." and then it's got a quote from the actual

1456
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,020
transcript, right? so you can see it's quoted, this is the craziest ai release i've ever seen,"

1457
01:46:55,020 --> 01:47:00,260
which is something that she used inside the presentation, right? then we've got the presentation,

1458
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:04,380
as you can see right here. again it's using nana banana and all the custom notes from the transcript.

1459
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:10,880
and we again automated that in one single click. even took some sort of screenshot from the

1460
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,800
video and then plugged that in, right? and it's actually got a link as well inside that video,

1461
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,180
right? so you can see here it's super detailed. it's even got the office stack from the video

1462
01:47:20,180 --> 01:47:24,540
as well, and it's absolutely mind-blowing what this can generate and how quick and easy it is

1463
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:29,460
to generate this stuff. all right, now if you want to do that, all you do is you go back to

1464
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:34,480
notebook lm go to that custom automation that you've plugged in the sources to, and then you're

1465
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:38,960
just going to go over here and you're going to click slide deck, right? you just click side

1466
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,920
deck. now you can actually edit the slide deck before you start creating content with it. so

1467
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:47,640
you can see, for example, you can select detailed or you can select to present slides. so this

1468
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:52,180
is clean visual slides. this is something more comprehensive. you can select between short and

1469
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:56,000
default. you can choose your language. you can actually create in multiple languages, as you

1470
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,480
can see. and then you can actually describe what you want to include inside the slide deck if

1471
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:05,720
you want to customize it more before you actually publish it. so easy to do this stuff, and

1472
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:09,100
it's never been easier. and this is better than most humans can do, right? and this is the thing

1473
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:13,040
that i'm finding with most of these tools that are coming out now, especially the new releases,

1474
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:17,660
right? so i think the ai has really stepped up over the last couple of weeks. if you look at

1475
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:21,420
the latest releases from google i've got tons of videos and training inside. they are profitable

1476
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:25,340
to run that. but if you look at the latest updates, they are mind-blowing. they're doing things

1477
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:29,240
that are better than humans at this point, right? and it's the same with notebook lm it can

1478
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:33,880
create better presentations. it can create better infographics for most human designers, and

1479
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:41,080
it's absolutely mind-blowing what it can do. now again, that's only two updates that came from

1480
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:45,260
notebook collect so we've got deep research, we've got custom personas, we've got audio overviews,

1481
01:48:45,260 --> 01:48:50,300
we've got flashcards, video views, and this is free, right? there are capacity limits in terms

1482
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:54,280
of how many you can create based on the demand, but basically that's what you can do and how

1483
01:48:54,280 --> 01:49:00,180
you can use it, right? and again, these presentations are absolutely amazing, right? you can

1484
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:03,720
click on them, you can view them, you can switch around, you can actually download them, play

1485
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:08,020
them, go full screen, etc., right? and you can load that onto whatever platform you want to

1486
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:12,840
use. you can probably adapt it to instagram carousel, whatever you want to use, right? the thing

1487
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:18,020
is, right, i have an seo agency, and this is absolutely mind-blowing with this new technology

1488
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:22,480
that's coming out because i would have done things so different if notebook lm had these features

1489
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:27,380
when i was building my seo business. picture this, right? it's 3am i'm staring at my wall of

1490
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:31,900
research tabs. my eyes hurt, my brain is fried. i need to turn 47 different sub p's and seo

1491
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:37,460
guides into a training for my team. and back in the day, i would have spent like six to eight

1492
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:41,520
hours just reading everything, and then another four hours making notes, and then another three

1493
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:47,240
hours turning those notes into slides, and then another two hours actually making it look good,

1494
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:52,500
right? it's almost 20 hours for one single training. that was the old way. now imagine if you

1495
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:58,080
could dump all 47 guides into one place, aka notebook lm click a button, and get a full slide

1496
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,880
deck that looks like a designer just made it, ready to present in minutes. that's basically

1497
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:07,000
what notebook lm has just dropped for free. and here's where it gets wild. okay let's say you're

1498
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,340
building content for a client. well you have their brand guidelines that you can plug into notebook

1499
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:14,380
you have their old blog posts, you have their competitive research, you have their keyword data,

1500
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:18,900
and the old way was that you would read everything, you would take notes, you try to remember

1501
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:23,200
what goes where, miss stuff, go back, read again, make a dot, format it, hope it makes sense,

1502
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:28,780
right? the new way with notebook lm is literally all you do is you plug in a source over here,

1503
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:33,140
you get your custom notebook lm over here, and you can actually ask your questions inside here

1504
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:37,400
and create a mind map or whatever. and then you just create your presentation or your infographic,

1505
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:42,680
as you can see, right? how easy is this stuff? it's absolutely mind-blowing how powerful this

1506
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:48,760
is and how easy it is to do. okay and i don't think most people are aware of, especially business

1507
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:52,780
owners, because they're too busy running their business. so again, the new way is that you upload

1508
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:57,180
everything, ask notebook lm to make an infographic or a presentation or a video showing the

1509
01:50:57,180 --> 01:51:01,020
content strategy, and it's done. you ask it to make a slide deck for a client meeting, done.

1510
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:04,700
on a podcast-style breakdown where you can listen to this stuff whilst driving or whatever,

1511
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:09,260
it's done, right? and i remember sitting in my home office, frustrated, tired, thinking there

1512
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:13,540
has to be a better way to process all this information. i was building automations, i was building

1513
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:19,620
tools, but the gap between raw research and something i can actually use was still huge. and

1514
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:24,860
today that gap just closed. this week i've uploaded my notes from like 12 different videos about

1515
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:29,500
ai trends. i've uploaded three pdf reports. i've uploaded my own google docs about what i've

1516
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:33,700
learned. and then i've asked notebook lm to make me a slide deck about the top five ai tools

1517
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:38,880
solopreneurs should learn in 2025. and it gives me the slides back: beautiful design, charts

1518
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,520
in the graphics, key points pulled from everything i uploaded, and i didn't write a single slide,

1519
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,560
right? this is a mind-blowing thing. i didn't design anything. i just uploaded my research,

1520
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,140
clicked a button, and now think about what that means for someone starting out or a solopreneur

1521
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:56,640
running a business, right? you don't need designers. you don't need to spend hours formatting.

1522
01:51:56,640 --> 01:52:01,540
you don't need to struggle with making your research actually useful. you just need to know

1523
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:06,360
how to ask the right questions and then how to feed it the right sources. and you can see how

1524
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:10,160
easy that is. you know what sources you want to feed it, okay? and that's exactly what i teach

1525
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:13,940
inside the airprof water it's not just like the basic stuff that everybody already knows. these

1526
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:17,880
are the frameworks to think it, the way to combine tools like this into systems that actually

1527
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:22,200
automate and run parts of your business. because here's the truth: this tool is free. anyone

1528
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,260
can use it. but most people upload one pdf and give up, okay? and the people who win today are

1529
01:52:27,260 --> 01:52:30,840
the ones who understand the bigger picture, right? who know how to stack these tools together,

1530
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,920
have a community showing them what's working right now. and that's why today i want to show

1531
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:39,480
you exactly how this works step by step so you can see what's possible when you know how to

1532
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:45,160
use what's already available to you. so we're going to talk about the goldie source to asset

1533
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:49,820
framework, and this is basically my approach to turning messy research into polished business

1534
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:54,220
assets without design skills or spending hours formatting, right? and the framework has five

1535
01:52:54,220 --> 01:53:00,560
steps: source, stack, shape, style, and share. so let's talk about source. so for example, what

1536
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:05,160
we can do here is we can start finding relevant sources. so i'm going to go to create a notebook.

1537
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:10,660
again this is available on notebook lm and from here, we can start uploading our sources. at

1538
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:14,700
this point, source means gathering everything related to your topic that you want to create

1539
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:20,240
around, right? pdfs, google, docs, youtube. links, website urls blog posts, even images, whiteboards,

1540
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,840
or handwritten notes. notebook can read it. most people upload one or two things and wonder

1541
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:28,880
why the output is weak. the secret is volume and quality. more sources and better sources equals

1542
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:34,960
better output. so let me talk you through exactly how to do this step by step. and tisha says,

1543
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,280
can you direct the style of the infographic? let's have a look at that in a second. all right,

1544
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:43,380
so what i'm going to do first is we are going to upload these sources. this is step one of the

1545
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:47,480
five-step framework that i'm teaching today, right? so where do you get the sources from? let's

1546
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:56,020
say for i want to do a new post on the latest ai news. i can grab videos from my youtube channel,

1547
01:53:56,020 --> 01:54:00,120
as you can see. so we're going to grab this one, and let's go over to notebook lm and we will

1548
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:04,360
load that in. i'm going to just paste i in. boom there we go. all right, now we're going to

1549
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:10,220
add another source. and the thing here to note is, let's say for example, you wanted to research

1550
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:17,200
the web, right? you can actually just put, okay, ai news november 2025 here, right? like that.

1551
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:22,180
so you could add and research the web here, plug in the fast research, etc. and then that's

1552
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:27,380
pretty simple and easy to do, all right? or you can go to add sources here, paste in some more

1553
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:32,860
text, add some youtube etc., right? so let's say for example, i want to grab more information

1554
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:38,260
about the latest tools this week, right? what i can do is i can open up this one. all right,

1555
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:42,480
so we're going to go to youtube here. we're going to open up this video on copilot ai we'll

1556
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:47,240
go back to notebook lm we're going to add another source right here. all right, there we go.

1557
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:52,540
and then we're going to add another one. so we're going to just keep going and add a bunch of

1558
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:57,520
sources. again the more and the better quality your sources are, the better the outputs from

1559
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,500
this particular process. all right, so we're going to take this training. it's a very in-depth

1560
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:08,000
training. it's a one-hour mega course on the new updates from gemini 3, which just came out.

1561
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,960
and we're going to go inside here, and we shall add another source, my friend, right? that we're

1562
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:17,420
going to plug in youtube there we go. and it's just loading up these sources. and once it's

1563
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:21,040
done, it's going to have a tick box next to it, right? so it's loaded in three sources that

1564
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:26,160
are custom trained for this particular notebook right here. now we could add many more sources.

1565
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:30,720
i'm on a live stream, so obviously i'm just going to keep it short. but we could add 300 sources

1566
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:35,940
if we wanted to, if we wanted to create like an insane amount of volume of sources. and again,

1567
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:39,800
you could add more if you don't want to load this manually, and you can search across web or

1568
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,260
even your content from google drive if you just wanted to automate this, right? super simple

1569
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:50,440
and easy to do. so that is the sourcing step of the five-step framework. and again, we've got

1570
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:54,560
a five-step framework, and it starts with source, and it's going to be stack, shape, style,

1571
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:00,400
and share. all right, so we've covered sources. now let's talk about stack. okay so you want

1572
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,450
to organize your sources by project or outcome, and you want to create separate notebooks for

1573
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:09,030
different purposes. so let me show you how that works. so if we go back to the home here inside

1574
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:13,250
notebook lm you can see all of these different notebooks i've created. so for example, claude

1575
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:19,030
opus building applications. with google's new ai stack. my sales recipe uploaded as a source,

1576
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:23,990
and create a custom notebook right here. google antigravity my book, seo link building mastery.

1577
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:28,490
right? you can actually see the dates, and you can organize your sources. you can actually delete

1578
01:56:28,490 --> 01:56:32,810
them, or you can edit the title to create a more organized, right? so for example, here we can

1579
01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:40,830
say, okay, edit the title, and let's call this the November, AI, news November. 2025. all right,

1580
01:56:40,830 --> 01:56:47,590
so we've got a notebook that's organized here based on the latest updates. okay so that is the

1581
01:56:47,590 --> 01:56:53,390
stack process. so again, you can create different notebooks for different purposes. so one for

1582
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:57,550
client presentations, one for your own training materials, one for content ideas, and just keep

1583
01:56:57,550 --> 01:57:03,150
them separate so that ai stays focused on what matters for your specific goal. and that is stage

1584
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:08,570
number two. okay now stage number three, and i'm blasting through this because i want to make

1585
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:13,470
sure that you get the most value possible in the shortest amount of time here, is shape. so

1586
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:18,370
that is stage number three. this means choosing the right output format for your goal. so notebook

1587
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:23,050
lm now gives you multiple options. so if we go over here, you can see, for example, we can select

1588
01:57:23,050 --> 01:57:27,370
between audio overview, video for you, mind map, reports, flashcards, quiz, infographic, slide

1589
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:31,950
deck, right? we can also add notes down here, and we can edit the outputs before we publish

1590
01:57:31,950 --> 01:57:36,770
them. in terms of shaping, slide decks will be for presentations, infographics will be for visual

1591
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:41,170
summaries, audio overviews for podcast-style breakdowns, flashcards for learning, and then quizzes

1592
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:46,770
for testing and understanding. each format serves a different purpose, right? so for example,

1593
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:54,290
here we can go into the infographic section, right? and we can select between our different

1594
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:58,150
languages. we could have portrait or square, depending on what orientation we want, or landscape.

1595
01:57:58,150 --> 01:58:03,450
we could choose level of detail, so you go with concise, standard, or detailed, right? and then

1596
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:07,150
inside the describe the infographic you want to create, you can talk about what you want to

1597
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:13,570
talk, right? so for example, here we can say, okay, talk about the use cases of chloride opus

1598
01:58:13,570 --> 01:58:18,810
4 5. which is the new update that literally just came out 24 hours ago, right? so you can do

1599
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:22,810
with some really cutting-edge stuff because you're loading in your custom sources, and because

1600
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:27,710
you're loading in custom from youtube you can take videos that are brand new with very in-depth

1601
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:32,490
training, right? and let's be honest, you can find almost anything on youtube about the topic

1602
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:37,850
you want to learn, right? so for example, michelle says, it's incredible what notebook lm does,

1603
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:43,050
and i would 100% agree with you, michelle that's a great point, right? we've covered three stages

1604
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:48,590
so far: sourcing, stacking, shaping, right? and this is a custom framework. this is the goldie

1605
01:58:48,590 --> 01:58:54,370
source asset framework now. step number four: style means customizing the output to match your

1606
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:59,230
brand and audience. so you can now set like custom personas, or you can tell it exactly how

1607
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:03,830
you want to write and create. so let me show you how that works, right? so for example, let's

1608
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:09,710
say we wanted to create a video over here. we can choose between explainer or brief, right?

1609
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:14,590
so we could go with brief and really just simplify that video overview. we can go with the language

1610
01:59:14,590 --> 01:59:20,010
is english we can choose between visual styles, right? so we can select something that's designed

1611
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:25,330
based on the style that we want, right? so let's say for example, i can load in classic up here,

1612
01:59:25,330 --> 01:59:30,250
and then we can tell it exactly what we want the ai host to focus on inside the video overview,

1613
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:35,710
and we can shape it exactly how we want it. so let me show you how that works. we can say, okay,

1614
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:43,790
then show the benefits of joining the ai profit boardroom community with an offer stack at the

1615
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:50,250
end, and you could shape it exactly how you want. we or you can say, okay, then give a custom

1616
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:58,010
offer on how you can learn ai automation and save time using the ai profit boardroom community.

1617
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:05,800
okay and you can say, okay then transition naturally and give a custom offer. right we can then

1618
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:10,300
click generate, and we're shaping that video overview exactly how we want it, based on the custom

1619
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:14,680
sources and the guides we're giving, and the custom instructions we're giving to notebook ellen

1620
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:20,160
right and that is stage number four, which is style. okay now once you've done that, then you're

1621
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:24,520
going to come on to the fifth and the final stage, which is sharing. right sharing means actually

1622
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:28,380
using and sharing what you create. so there's no point creating this stuff if you're not going

1623
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:32,960
to use it. right it's all fun in games playing with tools, but if you're a business owner and

1624
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,400
you're a solopreneur, and you're trying to grow your business and trying to automate and save

1625
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:41,000
time, then you've actually got to use this stuff. right so for example, like a lot of my videos

1626
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,160
are ai avatar videos on youtube and the reason that i do that is because i want to showcase

1627
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:51,980
the power of ai right the same, for example, if we have a look at this page, i actually redesigned

1628
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:57,960
this whole page yesterday, which is a for our seo agency. and actually redesigned this whole

1629
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:03,980
page using cord opus 4 5. yesterday. so my main point here is don't just play with these tools,

1630
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:09,240
actually use them, actually create them. right diamond says i get this question every single

1631
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:14,100
live stream, which is this a real goldie or avatar? this is a real goldie unfortunately we're

1632
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:18,560
not at the point yet where ai avatars could do live streams yet, but i'm sure that's coming

1633
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:23,380
one day, along with zoom calls and sales calls and else. all right, but my main point here is

1634
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:31,680
like this beautiful page was created using claude opus right and how did we do it? we just asked

1635
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:35,860
opus to redesign the page, create html plug it into to go high level if you want more training

1636
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:40,640
on that, join the air profit boardroom basically. that's how it goes. right diamond says legend,

1637
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,280
love the content, big fan, appreciate you. thanks so much, diamond that's super kind, appreciate

1638
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:50,420
you. all right, so you can see how this works. and yeah, you can export slide decks as pdf so

1639
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:54,100
you can download the audio over use and embed that into a blog post. you can share the infographics

1640
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:59,760
on social media like i did a minute. all right, so if we go back to x right now, then i'm talking

1641
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:05,080
about using this stuff practically. and for example, we've got the example here, and diamond

1642
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:11,980
has actually replied to this. all right, so you can see here we've taken the infographic from

1643
02:02:11,980 --> 02:02:16,420
notebook ln plug that onto x we could use the same on linkedin or whatever platform we want

1644
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:21,120
to create content around and then share that. and that's literally in the space of what, 20

1645
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:26,860
minutes? that's got 147 views. all right, we've reached 147 new people. you know about our stuff,

1646
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:31,780
know about me because i've created that content and automated it with notebook right this stuff

1647
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:35,360
is crazy powerful if you know how to use it. you can reach a lot of people if you know how to

1648
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,560
use it, and that's what i'm showing you today in an actual practical way. right you might have

1649
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:43,360
been thinking, and i want to break down, okay, what's stopping you right now? okay so you might

1650
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,760
be thinking this sounds too good to be true, but let me address pretty much every doubt you

1651
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,760
have about notebook or these ai tools in general. okay so number one, some people want to say

1652
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,140
i'm not technical enough for this, but notebook lm is made for people who aren't technical.

1653
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:01,020
you upload files, you click buttons, you get results. right there's no code, there's no complicated

1654
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:06,160
setup. if you can use google drive or if you can click buttons, you can do this. right and if

1655
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:10,820
you can't click buttons, and you can hire a virtual assistant to click buttons for you. michelle

1656
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:14,980
says i joined, looking forward to more. thanks so much, michelle i really appreciate you. thanks

1657
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:19,620
so much for joining the aircraft recording and that is awesome. welcome on board. all right,

1658
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:24,100
so yeah, i can actually see you just joined now. that's awesome, thanks so much. you know, other

1659
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:28,400
people want to say i tried my ai tools before, and they gave me garbage. all right, so if we

1660
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:33,840
have a look at claude opus and the infographic that we just automated whilst i was on the live

1661
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,500
stream with you, so i'm not even concentrating fully. i'm just talking to you and guiding you

1662
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:41,300
through the process, and you can see how easy it is to create a beautiful infographic that,

1663
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:45,480
again, we could share. and you can see here, like the text is pretty much perfect, the copyright

1664
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:49,700
is super nice. it looks better than most human designers can make. it looks better than anything

1665
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:54,960
i could create. right we just did it in one click. some people are going to say i tried ai tools

1666
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:59,880
before, and they gave me garbage, but that's because most ai tools pull from the entire internet

1667
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:05,000
and make things up. right whereas notebook lm only uses what you give it. it can't hallucinate

1668
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,500
facts because it only knows what's in your sources, and every answer comes with citations you

1669
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:14,800
can check. right so for example, if we go back here, we escape off there, and then we start

1670
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:19,420
typing here, and we say, okay, let's take one of these auto-suggest questions. so it says, how

1671
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:23,500
does claude opus compare functionally and economically to its top competitors like gemini pro

1672
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:27,960
and it'll actually analyze and examine these sources that were plugged in, and then it gives

1673
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:32,000
the sources for each answer. right so you can see it's used the sources that we've given it.

1674
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,720
right so the only time this would mess up is if we give it bad sources, which is why we need

1675
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:41,120
to make sure that we load in good sources into this. right michelle says they turned out quite

1676
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:45,680
nice. 100, they're looking really nice. it's looking really good. all right, some people are

1677
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:50,240
going to say i don't have time to learn another tool, but this tool actually saves you time.

1678
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:53,960
the learning curve is maybe 10 minutes, and you've pretty much been through the learning curve

1679
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:59,100
with me today. so you know the time savings hours per week, and you can generate a full presentation

1680
02:04:59,220 --> 02:05:03,420
just by clicking a button. you go off, make some coffee, and you come back, and it's ready to

1681
02:05:03,420 --> 02:05:09,500
go. also some people say free tools always have a catch, and the thing is with notebook lm or

1682
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:15,880
with gemini with nano banana pro with ai studio etc., the catch is that google wants you in

1683
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:19,820
their ecosystem. that's it. all right, the core features are actually free. i think you get

1684
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:24,200
up to something like 100 notebooks, 50 sources per notebook, three audio overviews per day,

1685
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:28,780
and that's more than enough. most people watching this, i would say for 99, i've never created

1686
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:33,320
more than three audio reviews in one. i've never created more than 50 sources per notebook.

1687
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:38,780
right so this is more than enough for most people. and other people say my business is different,

1688
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:43,100
this won't work for me, but this works for any business that deals with information. coaches

1689
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:47,500
you need to create training materials. consultants who need client presentations. content creatives,

1690
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:52,260
you need to research topics. freelancers you need to organize project notes. if you read or

1691
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:57,380
write anything, this is probably going to help you. okay and so this is what i'm talking about

1692
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:01,760
here. and then if we have a look, we've got the video overview. so i'm actually going to mute

1693
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:06,020
this because i don't think the sound will be that good, but it does come with these examples,

1694
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:12,880
and this is what it's all about. all right, now our legends. hi julian i'm standing at the chow

1695
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:17,620
fryer. my first day in bangkok welcome to bangkok just out of the gym, i'm watching a live stream.

1696
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:21,300
what a great synergy. that's what we're talking about. what sort of a legend goes to the gym

1697
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:26,920
at what, 6:50 a.m., and then comes out and watch a video and learns about ai like you're absolutely

1698
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:31,460
smashing it. that's a great way to start the game. so good for you, man. if you, i would read

1699
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:35,280
out your name, but it says out on the name, but it's good to see here, and welcome to bangkok

1700
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:40,720
good on you for getting yourself out there. michelle says omg i have a creator. i love his trainings.

1701
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:44,880
he gives us transcripts with the replay and a problem all into notebook to keep track and quick

1702
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,880
reference. that is what we're talking about. so there's some great ways to use this stuff. right

1703
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:54,500
it's really exciting, and honestly, i think it's never been such a great time to learn, but

1704
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:58,660
also to be running a business. if you're running a business, if you're in a business, what a

1705
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:03,400
time. right like you don't need a team, you don't need a big squad of people to manage. you

1706
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:08,660
just create stuff like this, and you've got a whole marketing team in one click using ai and

1707
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:12,500
you can automate a lot of this as well. other people, when i say i don't have anything to upload,

1708
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:17,720
but i would just start with whatever you have. right so for example, michelle uses the transcripts

1709
02:07:17,720 --> 02:07:22,600
from a creator that she really likes. right and that's a perfect way to use it. you could plug

1710
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,620
in past client calls, you could plug in your own notes, articles, you say competitive websites,

1711
02:07:26,620 --> 02:07:31,060
youtube videos in your niche. you have way more sources than you think. anything you consume,

1712
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:36,100
you can pretty much plug into this. here and story box maker says can we share to folks about

1713
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:41,060
a google account? the link is not totally public in my opinion. as far as i know, i think you

1714
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:45,480
do need to log in with google account. again this is why it's free. right they want more people

1715
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:50,320
inside the ecosystem, and one of the ways to do that is by making sure people log in. by the

1716
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:54,620
way, if anyone's watching this and you want to share this stuff, so you can click on share in

1717
02:07:54,620 --> 02:07:57,960
the top right over here, and then you can share your notebook. and then you can actually add

1718
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:03,580
a welcome note here. you can add people's emails, you can choose between full notebook, chat

1719
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:08,080
only, and you can make this restricted or give anyone with link access. and then you just copy

1720
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:12,160
the link, hit save once you make the changes. boom shakalaka, you can share this with the world.

1721
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:19,300
right so it's crazy powerful, super easy to use, doesn't take a long time, and you can see how

1722
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:25,340
this works step by step. right so let's keep going through the official. davey b says hey everyone,

1723
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:30,160
good to see you. so let's have a look at this video that we're going to play back now. so this

1724
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:35,620
is a video. it does come with a narrated voiceover at the top. you can download that as well.

1725
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:41,100
so if we download that, we can download over here, and i'm just going to go full screen with

1726
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:45,720
this. and also we can play the video. let's see what it's like. right now, i have muted the

1727
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:51,540
sound because i don't think it'll sound very good on the replay, but you can see that it's it's

1728
02:08:51,540 --> 02:08:56,760
created a quote from the particular transcript, designed the whole presentation, added a narration,

1729
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:01,920
made it downloadable. it's just playing it back automatically. it's clean, it's nicely designed,

1730
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:08,020
and it's created using the directions we gave it. it's even great some nice charts, as you can

1731
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:14,480
see in terms of the test scores. it talks about what makes opus 4 5 so different, and then you've

1732
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:17,640
got the old way and the new way, which is something that i always like to look at. it's okay,

1733
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:21,420
what were people doing previously, and what are they doing now? and it's taking that information

1734
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:26,820
from the transcripts that i plugged in and then started to use that. so you can see how easy

1735
02:09:26,820 --> 02:09:31,560
and powerful this is and how quick it is to make it. so as that's playing, let me talk you through

1736
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:34,900
some other stuff. some people want to say the outputs won't be good enough for clients. i would

1737
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:38,880
argue that these outputs are starting points. you can customize everything. you can choose format,

1738
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:43,140
set the tone, add your own polish. this tool does 80% of the work, and then you just add the

1739
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:48,020
20%. how do you do that? you give it the alternative, so you give it the custom instructions.

1740
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:54,340
michelle says this is a great alternative to gamma i would agree with you. and some people say

1741
02:09:54,340 --> 02:09:58,640
i can't afford to pay for tools, but this is free for the core features. it's free. there is

1742
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:03,120
a premium pricing that you can sign up to on notebook alembic you can just use the free stuff

1743
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:07,740
and then see what you think. now other people say i'm overwhelmed by all the tools out there.

1744
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:12,240
julian you talk about a new tool every single day, and that's true, to be fair. like we talk

1745
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:16,960
about opus and then copilot and then gemini and then red plate and then genspark and this is

1746
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:21,860
all within the last 24 hours pretty much. right what i would say here is that's exactly why

1747
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:26,040
you need one place that teaches you what actually matters. so for example, inside the air, profit,

1748
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:29,120
board, and. we just cut free the noise. we show you what's working right now. we help you build

1749
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:36,000
systems, not just random tools. some people, some wild people might say what if google shuts

1750
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,460
down and then we lose access to this tool? google has been building notebook alembic since 2023.

1751
02:10:40,460 --> 02:10:45,820
they just added it to google workspace for businesses. they released mobile apps this year for

1752
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:50,300
notebook alemb they're investing more, not less, and i think this tool is becoming part and

1753
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:55,020
core of how google thinks about ai productivity. and then some people say i'm already doing

1754
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:59,980
okay without ai but okay is the enemy of great. okay your competitors are learning these tools.

1755
02:10:59,980 --> 02:11:05,200
the ones who don't use them and learn them will fall behind. the question isn't whether ai will

1756
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:09,460
change how business works, is whether you'll be ahead of that change or just playing catch up.

1757
02:11:09,460 --> 02:11:15,720
okay that was the video generated. as you can see, pretty simple and easy to do, and you can

1758
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:19,780
download this stuff. you can customize it. you can create many different notebooks. we've got

1759
02:11:19,780 --> 02:11:25,160
the chatbot as well inside here. what's pretty cool about this, this is great for training your

1760
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:29,780
team. so if your team has questions and you're getting a little bit bored of explaining the

1761
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:34,240
same thing over and over again, but at the same time, maybe your sap and your step-by-step instructions

1762
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:39,480
are too long as a playbook. for example, like our sales sap it's 70 pages. if that's the case,

1763
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:43,540
if your playbook is too big, then they can actually just go inside something like this. it's

1764
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:47,640
custom trained on our playbook, as you see on the left, and then they can start typing and asking

1765
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:52,300
questions. that's great because now it saves you time, and you don't have to train people over

1766
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:57,960
and over again, which, as we all know, can be quite monotonous. all right, this stuff is really

1767
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:02,540
simple and easy to use. and again, you might be saying this content, maybe it's ai where it's

1768
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:07,200
not that useful, people don't like it. but you can see here, for example, this infographic that

1769
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:12,260
we just posted and automated on the live stream today, it's already got 200 views. all right,

1770
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:17,080
so it's already reached 200 new people. all right, now if you reach 200 new people every single

1771
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:22,040
day, would that help you reach more customers? 100. right now, imagine if you 10x out if you

1772
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:26,200
got a virtual system to help you with that. right wouldn't it be powerful? 100. and that's what

1773
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:30,960
we're talking about here. now what i want to do is i want to show you a 30-day plan in terms

1774
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:35,940
of how you can implement this step-by-step into your business. right because really what i want

1775
02:12:35,940 --> 02:12:40,220
you to do is just take this stuff and learn it and actually implement it. there's no point just

1776
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:44,280
watching the video about it. take action so that you can see the transformative effects. all

1777
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:49,440
right, so what to do from day 1 to 30, and this is all inside the notes of the ai profit boarding

1778
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:54,000
so. again, you just go into the air profit boarding comes with an amazing community of 1,700

1779
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,460
people just like me, interested in ai sharing their latest information. you can also get a calendar

1780
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:04,720
of coaching calls. all right, and if you want to start using this stuff, what you can do is

1781
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:08,380
you can just jump on the coaching course here, jump on the live calls, ask any questions you

1782
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:15,660
have, etc. super simple and easy to do. so if we go back to that 30-day plan, what you're going

1783
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:19,660
to do is just go to the air profit boardroom go to classroom then you're going to scroll down,

1784
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:26,820
and you would go to the sap update section, as you can see. and then inside this, you can see

1785
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:33,280
the link to the, okay, are these actually brand new updates? so you can see here, for example,

1786
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:38,680
this was just announced literally like a couple of days ago, this new slide decks feature. and

1787
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:43,220
what's interesting about this, they've said with slide decks, is less about making slides, more

1788
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:48,700
about telling stories. so this is the official notebook lm website, sorry, account on x and

1789
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:53,980
you can add sources to the storybook, deep research, simplified slides, remove the messy notes,

1790
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:59,260
and basically take all your messy notes and turn it into something amazing, like you can see.

1791
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:04,640
all right, so let's talk about this 30-day plan that we're talking about here. all right, so

1792
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:09,720
i would just go to notebooklm.google.com, assign them with your account, and create your first

1793
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:14,640
notebook. right just test out, upload three to five sources related to something you're working

1794
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:18,340
on right now. generate an audio. if you listen to it, this just gives you an immediate sense

1795
02:14:18,340 --> 02:14:23,120
of what's possible. all right, so in terms of a 30-day plan to get results with this stuff,

1796
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:27,940
that's what i would do. day one to day three, in terms of day four to seven, i would build your

1797
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:31,900
first business notebook. all right, so pick one recurring task in your business. maybe it's

1798
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:35,480
creating content, maybe it's client onboarding, maybe it's research, and create a dedicated

1799
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:40,000
notebook for it. okay upload everything related to that task, and that could be old documents,

1800
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,160
reference materials, examples you like, and generate a slide deck or infographic from it. and

1801
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:50,320
just see how much time this saves compared to you doing it manually. all right, so for example,

1802
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:57,240
here, let's say, for example, i want to create a new presentation for my team based on a sales

1803
02:14:57,240 --> 02:14:59,480
page we've created recently about seo right

1804
02:15:04,840 --> 04:14:59,640
SEO. Right could do here. i'm hoping this works. if not, i've got a backup idea. and if it doesn't

1805
04:14:59,640 --> 04:15:03,900
work, then that's okay as well. so what we're going to do is we're going to grab this page,

1806
04:15:03,900 --> 04:15:08,779
which is our new black friday deal for seo agency. check it out if you want. it's available

1807
04:15:08,779 --> 04:15:13,439
at juliangoldie.com if you're interested in ranking on google and llms and so what we're going

1808
04:15:13,439 --> 04:15:17,679
to do is we're going to take that url then we're going to go back to notebook.lm. like you can

1809
04:15:17,679 --> 04:15:21,739
see, we are going to plug in the websites. we'll just paste in the over here. and then we're

1810
04:15:21,739 --> 04:15:28,859
going to use that as training data so that we can create a custom notebook lm based on the information.

1811
04:15:28,859 --> 04:15:33,599
as you can see, right? so we've got this notebook lm this is custom trained. now there's a few

1812
04:15:33,599 --> 04:15:38,399
different ways that my team could use this, okay, to save me time from training them. so what

1813
04:15:38,399 --> 04:15:41,899
else? what could we do here? number one, we could create a slide deck. and inside the slide

1814
04:15:41,899 --> 04:15:49,039
deck, we could say, okay create a sales presentation, the client-facing course that sells the

1815
04:15:49,039 --> 04:15:57,639
new seo packages we have, plus the black friday deal we have on right now." okay we'll hit generate,

1816
04:15:57,639 --> 04:16:02,299
and then that's going to create a custom presentation based on the black friday deal that we

1817
04:16:02,299 --> 04:16:07,559
have for seo at the same time, what we can also do is, let's say, for example, i'm training

1818
04:16:07,559 --> 04:16:14,419
a new sales rep. he's got questions about how this works. i can share this tool with them. and

1819
04:16:14,419 --> 04:16:22,379
then i can go inside here, and i can say, okay give me a, uh, or tell me the 80/20 this deal,

1820
04:16:22,379 --> 04:16:28,079
plus what it includes," right? and what that's going to do is dig through the details of the

1821
04:16:28,079 --> 04:16:32,719
source we loaded in, which is a web page, right? so this sales page we literally just copied

1822
04:16:32,719 --> 04:16:37,639
and pasted in. and then we're going to go back to this tab, and you can see here that we've

1823
04:16:37,639 --> 04:16:42,839
got all the details for the 80/20 of this seo package that we're selling for our agency, right?

1824
04:16:42,839 --> 04:16:49,059
and so, now we're waiting for the slide deck to generate. we can use that to present back to

1825
04:16:49,059 --> 04:16:53,839
our clients once it's done. we can change the style of it. we could even create a video overview,

1826
04:16:53,839 --> 04:16:57,739
and with the video view, we could send that to clients, right? and then they can watch that

1827
04:16:57,739 --> 04:17:02,639
video breakdown of the sales page. or we could take that video overview, upload it, and then

1828
04:17:02,639 --> 04:17:07,519
embed it inside the page and plug it in right here. okay that's another example of how we do.

1829
04:17:07,519 --> 04:17:12,699
now taro says, cheers welcome to help." and story box maker. says, if you try it tomorrow, it

1830
04:17:12,699 --> 04:17:16,619
will be even better." yeah here is, uh, everything seems to get better, especially notebook

1831
04:17:16,619 --> 04:17:20,599
11. like when i was testing this out a year ago, it was already mind-blowing, but now it's even

1832
04:17:20,599 --> 04:17:25,079
better. so notebook 11 is crazy powerful, and this stuff just gets better pretty much every

1833
04:17:25,079 --> 04:17:29,599
single day. but i think the best time to start using it is now because the thing is, if you

1834
04:17:29,599 --> 04:17:33,199
wait, then your competitors are going to start using it. they're going to start learning it.

1835
04:17:33,199 --> 04:17:37,499
and if you understand how to use it now, then you've got a much better shot of getting better

1836
04:17:37,499 --> 04:17:41,319
results. whereas if you wait, like, you're going to fall behind. people going to start using

1837
04:17:41,319 --> 04:17:46,619
this without you, etc. okay so we're waiting for that slide deck to generate, but let's come

1838
04:17:46,619 --> 04:17:52,239
back to the 30-day plan. so we've talked about days 4 to 7, which is building your first business

1839
04:17:52,239 --> 04:17:57,599
notebook. and then days 8 to 14, you want to really start mastering custom personas. all right,

1840
04:17:57,599 --> 04:18:01,779
this is where most people plateau. so inside notebook LM you can just go into your settings,

1841
04:18:01,779 --> 04:18:05,959
create a custom persona. tell notebook LM exactly how you want it to respond, what time to use,

1842
04:18:05,959 --> 04:18:10,299
what level of detail, what format you prefer. test it with different prompts. refine until it

1843
04:18:10,299 --> 04:18:14,219
matches your style. so how do you do that? for example, here you can go to the settings, and

1844
04:18:14,219 --> 04:18:19,019
you can add, like, custom. here you can just add a custom example of how you want it to reply,

1845
04:18:19,019 --> 04:18:25,739
right? so for example, here, if you wanted, you could actually give this tool to your audience.

1846
04:18:25,739 --> 04:18:31,359
train it on whenever you want to teach your audience. and then inside the responses, you could

1847
04:18:31,359 --> 04:18:36,379
say, okay every time respond to links to my funnels," right? so let me show an example. up so

1848
04:18:36,379 --> 04:18:45,519
people ask questions. every time, answer it, plus transition into pitching booking a call here.

1849
04:18:45,519 --> 04:18:50,699
all right, what it's going to do is it's going to pitch our funnel links every time someone

1850
04:18:50,699 --> 04:18:55,479
uses it. so it's kind of like a sales tool that works without us having to do anything. so for

1851
04:18:55,479 --> 04:19:00,979
example, here, now we can ask a question. okay what happens if rank one is missing?" and then

1852
04:19:00,979 --> 04:19:05,919
you can see it's answered the question based on the custom source, which is great. but we were

1853
04:19:05,919 --> 04:19:10,199
talking about those custom personas that we're using, right? so for example, here, you can say,

1854
04:19:10,199 --> 04:19:15,659
if you're ready to implement this powerful A20 SEO framework with a guarantee, the absolute

1855
04:19:15,659 --> 04:19:20,359
best next step is to book a strategy call right now. this will allow us to discuss your specific

1856
04:19:20,359 --> 04:19:25,239
goals and how we can secure those page one rankings for you." and boom, it's got a link to our

1857
04:19:25,239 --> 04:19:30,759
funnels. all right, and then if we click, it's linked to our funnels right here. beautiful right?

1858
04:19:30,759 --> 04:19:35,779
so now it's a sales tool that's working for us, and we can share it to our audience. so pretty

1859
04:19:35,779 --> 04:19:40,079
amazing. you can upload this live on youtube to watch it later. so i actually have done that.

1860
04:19:40,079 --> 04:19:46,739
if you go to youtube on my live streams here, let me show this tab. so if you go to live, you

1861
04:19:46,739 --> 04:19:53,019
can watch back my recordings here. you can see here each day i do like a one to two-hour training

1862
04:19:53,019 --> 04:19:58,299
on AI. we do one pretty much every single day, and you can watch them back on youtube there.

1863
04:19:58,299 --> 04:20:04,799
all right, so it's pretty simple and easy to do this stuff. if we go back to the 30-day plan,

1864
04:20:04,799 --> 04:20:11,539
we've talked about day 1 to 3, which is set up first and win. all right, day 4 to 7, build your

1865
04:20:11,539 --> 04:20:18,139
first business notebook. day 8 to 14, master custom personas. all right, day 15 to 21, you want

1866
04:20:18,139 --> 04:20:22,559
to build your own content system. okay so create a notebook for your content ideas, and you

1867
04:20:22,559 --> 04:20:26,079
can upload articles you want to reference. you could upload transcripts, your own videos. you

1868
04:20:26,079 --> 04:20:30,779
could upload notes from your brainstorm. so just use this as a content brain. and then when

1869
04:20:30,779 --> 04:20:33,699
you need ideas as well, you could ask the notebook. and when you need to create something, just

1870
04:20:33,699 --> 04:20:38,039
generate it from your existing sources. so you can see how quick and easy it is to start building

1871
04:20:38,039 --> 04:20:44,219
your own custom content system. days 22 to 28, you can start creating client-ready assets. you

1872
04:20:44,219 --> 04:20:47,799
can use what you've learned to create something you can actually use with customers or clients.

1873
04:20:47,799 --> 04:20:51,779
that could be a presentation, guide, a training video outline, an infographic explaining your

1874
04:20:51,779 --> 04:20:56,479
product process, or something that adds value and looks professional without hours of design

1875
04:20:56,479 --> 04:21:01,379
work. and again, that's pretty simple and easy using notebook. and then the final day, i told

1876
04:21:01,379 --> 04:21:05,619
you this was a 30-day plan to make sure you can actually implement it into your business. the

1877
04:21:05,619 --> 04:21:10,919
final step is you can start documenting what works for you. so you can create templates you

1878
04:21:10,919 --> 04:21:15,799
can reuse. share your wins inside the alprofitboarding community. get feedback. help others

1879
04:21:15,799 --> 04:21:20,199
who are starting up. this is basically how you solidify your learning. become part of a community

1880
04:21:20,199 --> 04:21:24,879
that keeps you sharp, right? as an example of that, we go back to the alprofitboarding here.

1881
04:21:24,879 --> 04:21:29,059
we click on wins. you can see all of these different wins right here that people are sharing

1882
04:21:29,059 --> 04:21:35,819
right here. so for example, like steve steve just shared a youtube api that uploads from computer

1883
04:21:35,819 --> 04:21:39,839
directly to youtube right? pretty crazy. and then he shared how he's done it, and he's actually

1884
04:21:39,839 --> 04:21:44,179
shared a pdf right there. pretty crazy. you can see here, for example, we're sharing what we're

1885
04:21:44,179 --> 04:21:47,979
grateful for. we actually got 50 ways to be grateful. and i think that's one of the best things

1886
04:21:47,979 --> 04:21:54,579
about this community is, yes, we like ai but at the same time, let's enjoy the journey. let's

1887
04:21:54,579 --> 04:21:58,459
learn together. let's grow together. let's create something amazing, right? it's not about me.

1888
04:21:58,459 --> 04:22:02,919
it's about community and how we can share and learn and grow. also you can see here justin sharing

1889
04:22:02,919 --> 04:22:08,579
his heygen avatar and how he made his digital twin based on the tutorials we share inside the

1890
04:22:08,579 --> 04:22:12,619
alprofitboarding so you really want to just become part of that community and just share your

1891
04:22:12,619 --> 04:22:17,399
wins and systemize, right? the way that i would recommend you really grow is just by finding

1892
04:22:17,399 --> 04:22:20,999
people who are doing the same things as you or some people who are doing better things than

1893
04:22:20,999 --> 04:22:25,919
you. and then, in terms of prompts, you can see a bunch of prompts you can use right here. and

1894
04:22:25,919 --> 04:22:32,699
yeah, that's basically how it if we go back to notebooklmp here, we've still got the slide deck

1895
04:22:32,699 --> 04:22:36,959
being built out, and we'll come on to that in a second. but yeah, it's just, it's absolutely

1896
04:22:36,959 --> 04:22:42,019
amazing what you can do, what's possible, how powerful this is. and this is a free tool that's

1897
04:22:42,019 --> 04:22:46,739
just perfect for people learning about this stuff, people growing with this stuff, right? and

1898
04:22:46,739 --> 04:22:52,679
that's what the game is about, my friends. now if you're ready to start using this notebooklmp

1899
04:22:52,679 --> 04:22:59,059
if we go back to here, now we've got the presentation. so let's play that back. so you can see

1900
04:22:59,059 --> 04:23:03,919
here it's created that sales presentation. if we pull this up, there we go. so this presentation

1901
04:23:03,919 --> 04:23:08,359
created with notebooklmp based on that page we just loaded. we've got the details of the black

1902
04:23:08,359 --> 04:23:13,019
friday deal, right? and the cool thing about this is my team could easily just use this as a

1903
04:23:13,019 --> 04:23:17,739
sales presentation. now you probably want to customize it with your own branding, which you

1904
04:23:17,739 --> 04:23:22,159
can do inside notebooklmp as well. but you can see how powerful this is, right? and then it's

1905
04:23:22,159 --> 04:23:28,019
even created like the icons. everything's really nicely presented. it's really easy to use.

1906
04:23:28,019 --> 04:23:32,679
it's got the problem and the solution, right? so here's the problem. people waste time on audits.

1907
04:23:32,679 --> 04:23:37,419
here's our fix. we deliver what matters: content published, links built, rankings tracked, etc.

1908
04:23:37,419 --> 04:23:42,719
you can see here, for example, it talks about seo mess, which is a very common problem, right?

1909
04:23:42,719 --> 04:23:47,179
we built the system to fix it, which the aico engine. here's what you get inside the package.

1910
04:23:47,179 --> 04:23:51,939
here's a simple step-by-step process. and this is all accurate because it's based on our sources.

1911
04:23:51,939 --> 04:23:57,659
and then the black friday deal, what you get, etc., right? and this is all generated using notebooklmp

1912
04:23:57,659 --> 04:24:01,519
using that simple automation that i've shared with you today. and then we can download that,

1913
04:24:01,519 --> 04:24:06,379
or we could just share the link and give clients access to it directly. so for example, here

1914
04:24:06,379 --> 04:24:12,919
we could actually switch to anyone with link, hit save, and then if we click on the share button,

1915
04:24:12,919 --> 04:24:18,879
copy link slides, we're gonna open that up in a new tab. here we go, link to the slides over

1916
04:24:18,879 --> 04:24:25,399
here, right? pretty nice, pretty nice. that is notebooklmp and exactly what you get right here.

1917
04:24:25,399 --> 04:24:29,659
and the thing that i would say here is you've seen exactly how notebooklmp works. you've seen

1918
04:24:29,659 --> 04:24:33,699
how to turn messy research into slide decks, infographics, and audio content in minutes instead

1919
04:24:33,699 --> 04:24:38,019
of hours. but here's the things this is just one single tool, one single update, one piece of

1920
04:24:38,019 --> 04:24:42,319
the puzzle, okay? every single week and pretty much every single day now, there's something

1921
04:24:42,319 --> 04:24:46,439
new, whether that's a new tool, a new update, new ways to automate what used to take forever.

1922
04:24:46,439 --> 04:24:50,899
the question is, how do you keep up, right? how do you know what's worth learning and what's

1923
04:24:50,899 --> 04:24:55,359
a waste of time? how do you turn all these tools into actual systems that run your business?

1924
04:24:55,359 --> 04:25:00,199
and that's exactly why i built the AI profit boardroom right? if you haven't seen the AI profit

1925
04:25:00,199 --> 04:25:05,739
boardroom here it is. this is our community. this is everything that you get. you get a community,

1926
04:25:05,739 --> 04:25:11,559
classroom, calendar, etc. the main thing to note here, right, is that i put this together because

1927
04:25:11,559 --> 04:25:16,379
i used to be drowning in. every week, i'd spend hours figuring out if it was useful. most of

1928
04:25:16,379 --> 04:25:20,459
the time, it actually wasn't. i wasted months on things that didn't move the needle. so i've

1929
04:25:20,459 --> 04:25:24,519
started documenting what actually works: the frameworks, the automations, the combinations of

1930
04:25:24,519 --> 04:25:29,119
tools that have saved me time. so for example, here you see all these different trainings and

1931
04:25:29,119 --> 04:25:33,219
courses. if you've never used AI before, you don't know where to start, you can get that inside

1932
04:25:33,219 --> 04:25:38,019
this six-week automation classroom right here. you can also see we have a playbook on all our

1933
04:25:38,019 --> 04:25:44,319
best automations for shorts, avatar videos, etc. we even have, for example, all my latest trainings

1934
04:25:44,319 --> 04:25:48,999
from november 2025, where i just keep you updated with the frameworks that are working right

1935
04:25:48,999 --> 04:25:54,359
now. and basically, how it works, and thing to note here is like we update this every single

1936
04:25:54,359 --> 04:25:59,279
day, the latest stuff. i started sharing this stuff first with a few people, then more, and

1937
04:25:59,279 --> 04:26:03,339
now we have a community of business owners basically helping each other figure this out together.

1938
04:26:03,339 --> 04:26:08,379
and everything i've learned, every shortcut, every system is all right now. here's what you

1939
04:26:08,379 --> 04:26:12,799
get when you join the AI Profit Boarding today. number one, you get the AI avatar engine. it

1940
04:26:12,799 --> 04:26:17,399
looks something like this, right? so you go to the playbook, and you can see inside here we

1941
04:26:17,399 --> 04:26:23,919
have our AI avatar video process. and basically, this is how to duplicate yourself without hiring

1942
04:26:23,919 --> 04:26:28,679
anyone. you get automated AI systems that create content, handle delivery, and clone your best

1943
04:26:28,679 --> 04:26:34,339
processes. i've spent months building and testing this. i spent thousands of, but the value

1944
04:26:34,339 --> 04:26:39,059
of having a virtual team that works around the clock or an AI avatar that publishes youtube

1945
04:26:39,059 --> 04:26:44,979
videos for you all day, that's worth so much in terms of save time. you also get unlimited custom

1946
04:26:44,979 --> 04:26:48,999
automation requests. so normally, if you wanted someone to build a custom AI workflow, you'd

1947
04:26:48,999 --> 04:26:52,979
spend a lot, right? but inside the boardroom, you can request custom automations built specifically

1948
04:26:52,979 --> 04:26:57,639
for your business. if you need a workflow that connects your tools or a simple custom gpt you

1949
04:26:57,639 --> 04:27:02,599
can do that, right? so let me show an example. that if you go to this thread inside the AI Profit

1950
04:27:02,599 --> 04:27:08,599
Boarding, here you can see that we've got this free custom gpts request. inside the AI Profit

1951
04:27:08,599 --> 04:27:12,519
Boarding, you can post what you want, and then we create it. so chris requested the lead magnet

1952
04:27:12,519 --> 04:27:17,359
custom gpt and then we're like, here you go," his video notes. and then i create a custom video

1953
04:27:17,359 --> 04:27:21,539
showing how it works, plus the automation itself. i don't know any other community that's actually

1954
04:27:21,539 --> 04:27:25,559
doing that right now. the other thing that i would say here is you get daily live access to

1955
04:27:25,559 --> 04:27:30,139
me. so every single day, i go live. you can hop on. you can ask questions. you get coached in

1956
04:27:30,139 --> 04:27:35,939
real time. you also get the coaching inside the AI Profit Boarding as well. so if we go back

1957
04:27:35,939 --> 04:27:41,699
into the calendar section here, you can jump up the live streams here and just ask any questions

1958
04:27:41,699 --> 04:27:46,679
you have live on the course, okay? you get unstuck immediately because instead of spending hours

1959
04:27:46,679 --> 04:27:50,719
googling we just help you directly on that call. you don't have to wait for email replies, and

1960
04:27:50,719 --> 04:27:55,439
i'm guessing you just get direct help when you need it. you also get the fast track implementation

1961
04:27:55,439 --> 04:27:59,879
kit. so this is a copy and paste system so you can start implementing it immediately, right?

1962
04:27:59,879 --> 04:28:04,279
this is for people who want momentum right away. so there's no theory, no someday plans, just

1963
04:28:04,279 --> 04:28:09,299
actual implementation you can do within 24 hours to join it. so let me show an example. if you

1964
04:28:09,299 --> 04:28:13,919
go to the six-week AI automation master class here, you can learn how to build your own AI agent

1965
04:28:13,919 --> 04:28:19,679
in under five minutes, right? pretty crazy. and that's inside the AI Profit Boarding. just go

1966
04:28:19,679 --> 04:28:24,299
to the classroom and then go to start here as well. and then you also get the black vault, which

1967
04:28:24,299 --> 04:28:29,119
is my back-end system. so these are the exact automations behind major client work and deals,

1968
04:28:29,119 --> 04:28:33,639
right? so i'm opening this up for people who join during this window during black friday and

1969
04:28:33,639 --> 04:28:39,099
this alone took me months to refine. so for example, here, if you go to classroom and then you

1970
04:28:39,099 --> 04:28:44,239
go down here to the agency mastermind section, you learn how to land clients, how to grow your

1971
04:28:44,239 --> 04:28:47,319
agency. if you want to do more client work, if you're a freelancer, if you're a coach, etc.,

1972
04:28:47,319 --> 04:28:52,819
and you need clients, go right here. it shows you how to do sales leads, how to generate content

1973
04:28:52,819 --> 04:28:58,199
that actually attracts people into your business, etc. right so you can sign up now during black

1974
04:28:58,199 --> 04:29:03,439
friday just click the link below this video or go to the AI Profit Boarding.com. you can choose

1975
04:29:03,439 --> 04:29:07,239
between monthly or annual, and you get all the video notes from today as well. so if you go

1976
04:29:07,239 --> 04:29:12,039
to the classroom, you get all the video notes for today, plus previous calls, just to get the

1977
04:29:12,039 --> 04:29:16,659
coaching call recordings, the Q&A call recording bowl as well. if you go to the SP updates,

1978
04:29:16,659 --> 04:29:21,999
you can see this is updated with new video tutorials and step-by-step processes, as you can

1979
04:29:21,999 --> 04:29:25,779
see right here. and if you want to indicate how to get the latest stuff, you just go to the

1980
04:29:25,779 --> 04:29:31,459
date, right? so november 25th, november 26th, etc. i would just constantly add in new information

1981
04:29:31,459 --> 04:29:37,199
and new helpful tutorials inside the AI Profit Boarding.com to help you. all right, muller says

1982
04:29:37,199 --> 04:29:41,779
this one is pretty AI. i'm pretty sure this is actually me, but i appreciate that. i must be

1983
04:29:41,779 --> 04:29:47,239
quite smooth in presenting, so thank you very. i'll say that as a compliment. but yeah, so you

1984
04:29:47,239 --> 04:29:50,579
can see exactly how this works. if you haven't joined the AI Profit Boarding already, make sure

right now. and yeah, no book limit is absolutely amazing. and just to recap on what we've done

1988
04:45:05,559 --> 04:45:11,780
today, all right? so if you go back to here, in terms of what we've done, we've talked through

1989
04:45:11,780 --> 04:45:16,440
all the new features. so infographics, slide decks, deep research, custom personas, audio reviews,

1990
04:45:16,440 --> 04:45:20,960
flashcards and quizzes, video reviews, and how it's free for new users, right? so you can get

1991
04:45:20,960 --> 04:45:25,300
access to this stuff. and also, i've talked about my best prompts. and i've shown you the five-step

1992
04:45:25,300 --> 04:45:30,780
process to the Goldy Sourced Asset Framework, which is basically sourcing, stacking, shaping,

1993
04:45:30,780 --> 04:45:34,479
styling, and sharing. we've also talked about some limiting beliefs and how to avoid them holding

1994
04:45:34,479 --> 04:45:38,619
you back, so you can keep growing your business. and finally we've talked about the 30-day plan,

1995
04:45:38,619 --> 04:45:43,059
so you can start winning now and implement this for your business, right? and Mullo says, is

1996
04:45:43,059 --> 04:45:46,679
it just me or has AI got to the point where it's improving by the second? i would agree with

1997
04:45:46,679 --> 04:45:50,319
that. i think it's getting better and better. and i think the slower you are to implement this

1998
04:45:50,319 --> 04:45:54,659
stuff into your business, the more you fall behind, right? that's basically it.

1999
04:45:54,659 --> 04:45:59,879
Mullo says anticipating grok 5 in q1 january of this year. hopefully it's better than 4.1 because

2000
04:45:59,879 --> 04:46:04,639
i was pretty disappointed with that. but yeah, that's basically it, my friends. all right, google

2001
04:46:04,639 --> 04:46:11,879
just gave notebook lm superpowers. you can now upload photos of your handwritten notes, textbook

2002
04:46:11,879 --> 04:46:17,359
pages, even screenshots, and it reads them like they're typed documents. no more retyping anything

2003
04:46:17,359 --> 04:46:22,459
ever again. this is huge, and i'm about to prove it to you live. all right, so here's what just

2004
04:46:22,459 --> 04:46:26,979
happened. google rolled out a massive update to notebook lm and it's not just a small tweak.

2005
04:46:26,979 --> 04:46:33,379
this thing now accepts images as sources: photos of handwritten notes, textbook pages with diagrams,

2006
04:46:33,379 --> 04:46:38,999
screenshots of graphs, whiteboards from your office meetings, all of it. you drag it in, and

2007
04:46:38,999 --> 04:46:44,699
notebook lm reads it. it runs something called ocr which means optical character recognition.

2008
04:46:44,699 --> 04:46:49,199
that's just a fancy way of saying it looks at your photo and extracts all the text and meaning

2009
04:46:49,199 --> 04:46:53,519
from it. that you can ask it questions about what's in the image, like you're talking to someone

2010
04:46:53,519 --> 04:46:58,019
who just read your notes for you. let me show you why this matters. you know how you take a

2011
04:46:58,019 --> 04:47:02,199
photo of notes in class or at a meeting, or you screenshot something important from a website?

2012
04:47:02,199 --> 04:47:07,419
most people never look at those photos again. they just sit in your camera roll, collecting

2013
04:47:07,419 --> 04:47:13,159
digital dust. now you can upload those into notebook lm and actually use them. you can ask questions

2014
04:47:13,159 --> 04:47:18,479
like, what were the three main points from this meeting? or explain this graph to me in simple

2015
04:47:18,479 --> 04:47:24,019
terms. and notebook lm will answer based on what it sees in your image. it's like having a research

2016
04:47:24,019 --> 04:47:28,919
assistant who never sleeps and never complains. but here's where it gets even better. notebook

2017
04:47:28,919 --> 04:47:35,039
lm also added something called deep research and discover. these tools can automatically find

2018
04:47:35,039 --> 04:47:40,559
web sources for you, so you're not just limited to what you upload. you can tell notebook lm

2019
04:47:40,559 --> 04:47:46,139
to go find additional information on a topic, and it will pull articles, studies, and data from

2020
04:47:46,139 --> 04:47:51,939
across the web. then it combines everything: your uploads and the web sources into one big research

2021
04:47:51,939 --> 04:47:57,479
notebook, all in one place. no more juggling 10 browser tabs and three different note apps.

2022
04:47:57,479 --> 04:48:02,899
now let me walk you through exactly how this works. first you open notebook lm you create a

2023
04:48:02,899 --> 04:48:07,539
new notebook. then you drag in your images. let's say you have a photo of handwritten notes

2024
04:48:07,539 --> 04:48:12,839
from a lecture. you drop it into the sources panel. notebook lm processes it for a few seconds.

2025
04:48:12,839 --> 04:48:17,399
then boom, it shows up as a source you can reference. now you go to the chat and ask a question,

2026
04:48:17,399 --> 04:48:22,419
something like summarize the key points from my handwritten notes. notebook lm reads the image,

2027
04:48:22,419 --> 04:48:27,379
extracts the text, and gives you a clean summary. now okay, this is cool, but how do i take

2028
04:48:27,379 --> 04:48:32,619
this to the next level and actually scale my business with ai i want to tell you about the ai

2029
04:48:32,619 --> 04:48:37,819
profit boardroom this. is the best place to scale your business, get more customers, and save

2030
04:48:37,819 --> 04:48:43,459
hundreds of hours with ai automation. inside you'll find a community of entrepreneurs and business

2031
04:48:43,459 --> 04:48:49,420
owners who are using ai to grow faster and work smarter. we share case studies, tools, workflows,

2032
04:48:49,420 --> 04:48:53,939
and strategies that actually work. if you're serious about using ai to build your business,

2033
04:48:53,939 --> 04:48:58,100
you need to be in there. i'll drop the link in the description. check it out. all right, back

2034
04:48:58,100 --> 04:49:02,839
to notebook lm but it doesn't stop there. you can ask follow-up questions like, what did i write

2035
04:49:02,839 --> 04:49:08,239
about marketing strategies? or which section talked about customer retention? and it pulls the

2036
04:49:08,239 --> 04:49:13,539
exact info from your photo. let me give you a real example. say you photographed a textbook

2037
04:49:13,539 --> 04:49:19,320
page with a complex diagram. you upload it, then you ask, explain this diagram in simple terms.

2038
04:49:19,320 --> 04:49:24,540
notebook lm looks at the image, understands the visual layout, reads any labels or text, and

2039
04:49:24,540 --> 04:49:29,460
explains it back to you like you hired a tutor who can see what you're looking at. or imagine

2040
04:49:29,460 --> 04:49:35,120
you screenshot a graph from a research report. you upload it and ask, what's the shown in this

2041
04:49:35,120 --> 04:49:40,059
graph? notebook lm analyzes the data points, the axis, the legend, and tells you what the graph

2042
04:49:40,059 --> 04:49:46,600
is saying. no manual data entry, no squinting at tiny text, just instant analysis. now here's

2043
04:49:46,600 --> 04:49:51,280
the part that makes this a total game changer. you can mix image uploads with other source types:

2044
04:49:51,280 --> 04:49:56,739
pdfs, google docs, google sheets. even urls all in the same notebook. so you could have a photo

2045
04:49:56,739 --> 04:50:02,760
of your meeting notes, a pdf of a research paper, a google sheet with your data, and a few web

2046
04:50:02,760 --> 04:50:07,839
articles. notebook lm treats them all as sources and can answer questions that pull from any

2047
04:50:07,839 --> 04:50:12,539
of them. it's like building your own personal knowledge base. and the new discover and deep

2048
04:50:12,539 --> 04:50:16,939
research tools make it even more powerful. let's say you're researching a topic, but you don't

2049
04:50:16,939 --> 04:50:22,179
have all the sources yet. you can tell notebook lm to use deep research. it goes out and finds

2050
04:50:22,179 --> 04:50:27,920
relevant articles, studies, and data for you. then it adds those as sources to your notebook

2051
04:50:27,920 --> 04:50:33,760
automatically. you don't have to hunt down links or copy-paste urls notebook lm does the heavy

2052
04:50:33,760 --> 04:50:38,479
lifting. then you can ask questions that combine everything: your uploads and the web sources

2053
04:50:38,479 --> 04:50:43,719
it found. it's like having a research team working for you around the clock. but i need to be

2054
04:50:43,719 --> 04:50:50,039
real with you about the limitations because no tool is perfect. and if you don't know the weak

2055
04:50:50,039 --> 04:50:57,459
spots, you're going to get burned. first ocr is good, but magic if your handwriting is messy.

2056
04:50:57,459 --> 04:51:03,459
the accuracy drops. if your photo is blurry or the lighting is bad, is going to miss stuff.

2057
04:51:03,459 --> 04:51:09,559
so always double-check what it extracted. compare the image side by side with what notebook

2058
04:51:09,559 --> 04:51:16,479
lm says it found. don't just trust it blindly. second there are upload limits. you can't just

2059
04:51:16,479 --> 04:51:22,199
dump a thousand images into one notebook. google has caps on the number of sources and the file

2060
04:51:22,199 --> 04:51:27,699
sizes. so if you're working on a massive project, you might need multiple notebooks. third some

2061
04:51:27,699 --> 04:51:33,039
features are still english only, like the audio overview feature where notebook lm generates

2062
04:51:33,039 --> 04:51:38,119
a spoken summary. if your content is in another language, that feature won't work yet. now let's

2063
04:51:38,119 --> 04:51:43,059
talk about privacy. this is important. when you upload an image, notebook lm processes it in

2064
04:51:43,059 --> 04:51:48,859
the cloud. the that means google sees it. if you're uploading sensitive information like medical

2065
04:51:48,859 --> 04:51:53,239
records or confidential business documents, you need to be careful. you might want to redact

2066
04:51:53,239 --> 04:51:58,579
names, account numbers, or anything private before you upload, or just avoid uploading it until

2067
04:51:58,579 --> 04:52:03,159
notebook lm offers local processing options. right now, everything goes through google servers,

2068
04:52:03,159 --> 04:52:07,639
so treat it the way you treat any cloud service. if you wouldn't put it in google drive don't

2069
04:52:07,639 --> 04:52:12,099
put it in notebook lm all right, so how do you get the best results with this image feature?

2070
04:52:12,099 --> 04:52:17,739
here are my tips. number one, take clean photos. shoot straight on, not at an angle. make sure

2071
04:52:17,739 --> 04:52:22,699
the lighting is bright and even, no shadows across the page. the cleaner your image, the better

2072
04:52:22,699 --> 04:52:29,219
the ocr number two, use high resolution. don't upload a tiny compressed screenshot. if you can,

2073
04:52:29,219 --> 04:52:35,099
use the original photo or a high-quality scan. more pixels means better text recognition. number

2074
04:52:35,099 --> 04:52:40,799
three, test it first. upload a sample image and see what notebook lm extracts. if it's missing

2075
04:52:40,799 --> 04:52:45,439
words or getting things wrong, retake the photo with better conditions. number four, verify

2076
04:52:45,439 --> 04:52:50,659
the output. always check the original image against what notebook lm says, especially for numbers,

2077
04:52:50,659 --> 04:52:55,779
dates, or critical facts. ocr can misread similar-looking characters like an eight and a capital

2078
04:52:55,779 --> 04:53:01,139
b or a zero and the letter o if you're using this for something important, you have to verify.

2079
04:53:01,139 --> 04:53:05,979
now here's something cool you can do with this. you can build a personal research library. every

2080
04:53:05,979 --> 04:53:15,159
time you read a book, take photos of the you print out notes from meetings, whiteboard sessions,

2081
04:53:15,159 --> 04:53:19,459
anything. over time, you'll have this massive searchable database of everything you've learned.

2082
04:53:19,459 --> 04:53:25,399
and you can ask notebook lm to pull ideas from across all your sources, like show me everything

2083
04:53:25,399 --> 04:53:31,159
i've learned about email marketing from all my sources, or what are the common themes in my

2084
04:53:31,159 --> 04:53:35,399
meeting notes from the last three months. it's like giving yourself a photographic memory, but

2085
04:53:35,399 --> 04:53:40,319
better because you can search and analyze it. another use case: students can photograph their

2086
04:53:40,319 --> 04:53:45,539
class notes and textbooks, then use notebook lm to quiz themselves or generate study guides.

2087
04:53:45,539 --> 04:53:51,299
instead of rereading 100 pages, you ask questions and get targeted answers. freelancers and

2088
04:53:51,299 --> 04:53:56,119
consultants can use it to organize client research. upload notes from discovery calls, screenshots

2089
04:53:56,119 --> 04:54:02,539
of competitor websites, pdfs of industry reports, then ask notebook lm to find patterns or create

2090
04:54:02,539 --> 04:54:07,239
summaries for your client presentations. content creators can it to gather research for videos,

2091
04:54:07,239 --> 04:54:13,379
articles, or courses. take photos of books, upload pdfs add web sources, and let notebook lm

2092
04:54:13,379 --> 04:54:17,579
help you outline your content. the possibilities are kind of endless. but here's the thing:

2093
04:54:17,579 --> 04:54:23,439
this tool is only as good as the sources you give it. if you upload garbage, you get garbage

2094
04:54:23,439 --> 04:54:28,719
out. so be intentional about what you add and always fact-check. notebook lm can summarize and

2095
04:54:28,719 --> 04:54:33,559
cite, but it can also get things wrong, especially if the source itself is wrong or if the ocr

2096
04:54:33,559 --> 04:54:38,479
misreads something. so use it as a starting point, not the final answer. now let me hit you

2097
04:54:38,479 --> 04:54:43,159
with one more feature that ties this all together. the discover tool doesn't just find random

2098
04:54:43,159 --> 04:54:47,359
articles. it actually tries to find sources that are relevant to the question you're asking

2099
04:54:47,359 --> 04:54:52,219
or the topic you're researching. so if you're writing a paper on climate change and you've uploaded

2100
04:54:52,219 --> 04:54:57,619
some notes, you can tell notebook lm to discover more sources. it will go find scientific studies,

2101
04:54:57,619 --> 04:55:03,299
news articles, and expert opinions. then it adds them to your notebook, and you can ask questions

2102
04:55:03,299 --> 04:55:08,159
that pull from all of them. it's like having a librarian who knows exactly what you need before

2103
04:55:08,159 --> 04:55:13,679
you even ask. and because everything is in one notebook, you're not switching between apps or

2104
04:55:13,679 --> 04:55:18,159
losing track of where you found something. all your sources are right there. you can see them

2105
04:55:18,159 --> 04:55:22,579
in the sources panel. you can click on any source to read the full text or view the original

2106
04:55:22,579 --> 04:55:27,879
image. and when notebook lm. gives you an answer, it cites which source it pulled from, so you

2107
04:55:27,879 --> 04:55:32,699
can trace every claim back to the original. that's huge for credibility, especially if you're

2108
04:55:32,699 --> 04:55:37,239
doing research for work or school. use it to build a personal research library, create study

2109
04:55:37,239 --> 04:55:42,519
materials, organize client work, or gather content research. start small, be consistent, and

2110
04:55:42,519 --> 04:55:46,999
let the tool do the heavy lifting. that's everything you need to know. now go try upload an

2111
04:55:46,999 --> 04:55:51,679
image, ask a question, see what notebook lm can do. and here's what i want you to do: drop a

2112
04:55:51,679 --> 04:55:55,419
comment below and tell me what kind of image you're going to test first. handwritten notes,

2113
04:55:55,419 --> 04:56:00,599
a textbook page, screenshot? i want to know. julian goldie reads every comment, so make sure

2114
04:56:00,599 --> 04:56:06,299
you comment below. today we're going to be running through the latest updates from notebook

2115
04:56:06,299 --> 04:56:13,559
lm so, notebook lm have. released three new big updates today. one of them is the deep research

2116
04:56:13,559 --> 04:56:17,339
update. this literally just been announced a few hours ago, as you can see. and they've said

2117
04:56:17,339 --> 04:56:22,279
rolling out now, deep research browses hundreds of sites to craft an organized report and give

2118
04:56:22,279 --> 04:56:27,639
you an annotated list of sources for deeper exploration, all of which you can add directly to

2119
04:56:27,639 --> 04:56:32,639
your notebook. so that is update number one. we also have update number two, where they've said

2120
04:56:32,639 --> 04:56:36,139
finally the moment you've been waiting for, rolling out today, you can now create your own custom

2121
04:56:36,139 --> 04:56:40,479
video overview styles by tapping the prompt in the customization box. drop your favorite examples,

2122
04:56:40,479 --> 04:56:45,899
blah blah blah. we also have another update which says chat history is rolling out now, so you

2123
04:56:45,899 --> 04:56:51,059
can actually close the resume it later without losing your conversation, which is another new

2124
04:56:51,059 --> 04:56:56,379
update on notebook lm now if you've never used notebook lm before, it's a really powerful and

2125
04:56:56,379 --> 04:57:02,959
free tool that you can use to generate outputs like you can see right here, right? and you can

2126
04:57:02,959 --> 04:57:08,819
use this to generate like videos, podcasts. you can create some really powerful tools, kind

2127
04:57:08,819 --> 04:57:12,719
of like custom trained on whatever you want, essentially. and i'm going to show you exactly

2128
04:57:12,719 --> 04:57:16,959
how to use this. all right, so if we go to create new, we're going to test out the deep research

2129
04:57:16,959 --> 04:57:23,679
mode first. we can use deep research mode here inside notebook lm so let's have a look here,

2130
04:57:23,679 --> 04:57:27,939
and we'll test this out. so you can see we've got this try deep research for an in-depth report

2131
04:57:27,939 --> 04:57:31,779
on new sources, and you've got an option between deep research and fast research, right? so

2132
04:57:31,779 --> 04:57:37,579
fast research was the old option where you could pretty much just quickly get answers and search

2133
04:57:37,579 --> 04:57:41,439
and that sort of thing. now deep research is where you can get more in-depth reports, and then

2134
04:57:41,439 --> 04:57:46,159
you can use those to create audio or to create videos or to create mind maps or reports or flashcards

2135
04:57:46,159 --> 04:57:52,599
or quizzes, right? so we can go over here, and we shall say, okay, research do deep research

2136
04:57:52,599 --> 04:57:58,599
and the latest ai updates this week, right? just as an example, you can change this prompt to

2137
04:57:58,599 --> 04:58:03,979
whatever you want, but we're going to just use that as a basic example for exploring degrees.

2138
04:58:03,979 --> 04:58:08,719
nicolas says it's the essential ai tool. it is indeed, my friends. i think out of everything

2139
04:58:08,719 --> 04:58:14,019
that i've tested, honestly, like, um, is miles ahead of 99% of the stuff i've tested. i've put

2140
04:58:14,019 --> 04:58:18,419
like thousands of hours into this, right? so if you've never tried notebook lm before, definitely

2141
04:58:18,419 --> 04:58:22,459
check it out. whilst we're waiting for the deep research mode to run, i'm going to open up a

2142
04:58:22,459 --> 04:58:25,779
new tab, and i'll show you some of the other examples that we do. for example, here we have

2143
04:58:25,779 --> 04:58:29,959
the deep research running, and then if we this tab instead, you can see some examples of what

2144
04:58:29,959 --> 04:58:34,139
i created previously. for example, here we've loaded up a bunch of sources into our content,

2145
04:58:34,139 --> 04:58:38,559
and then we can use this kind of custom train tool to answer any questions that we have. but

2146
04:58:38,559 --> 04:58:43,339
also, we can automate audio overviews, video views, mind maps, etc. so it's really easy to use,

2147
04:58:43,339 --> 04:58:50,039
quite simple. and the next option that we have is the custom video overview styles, right? so

2148
04:58:50,039 --> 04:58:54,819
if we go to video overview here, and then we click on edit based on the sources that we have

2149
04:58:54,819 --> 04:58:59,179
on the left-hand side, we can start using this for video views, right? so we choose our language,

2150
04:58:59,179 --> 04:59:03,059
like you can see you can get all sorts of languages down here on the left-hand side. and then

2151
04:59:03,059 --> 04:59:07,279
you can choose what sort of visual style you want. now you can actually click on custom here,

2152
04:59:07,279 --> 04:59:13,019
and you can type what the visual style is that you want for your particular presentation. so

2153
04:59:13,019 --> 04:59:17,419
if we open this up, you've got, for example, whiteboard style, anime, or heritage, or watercolor,

2154
04:59:17,419 --> 04:59:21,579
or paper craft, or retro print, right? all these. and now, you can, so if you've got a certain

2155
04:59:21,579 --> 04:59:26,439
style in mind, or even like a certain artist that you want to use for this, you can use it inside

2156
04:59:26,439 --> 04:59:31,119
notebook lm like you can see just by going to the video overview and then describing what you

2157
04:59:31,119 --> 04:59:35,439
want as a prompt. so we'll try that in a second here. you could also, for example, try 8-bit

2158
04:59:35,439 --> 04:59:41,199
pixelated, and then you can see like this really interesting video view style, pop art, hyper-realistic,

2159
04:59:41,199 --> 04:59:46,359
and super cute or super weird, like surreal. so let's go over here. we'll try this out. so i'm

2160
04:59:46,359 --> 04:59:49,979
going to say, okay, super weird style. in fact, you know what? i'm going to take a screenshot

2161
04:59:49,979 --> 04:59:55,069
here, and then we go over to chat gpt and i'm pasting that screenshot, and i'll say, okay. come

2162
04:59:55,069 --> 05:00:02,849
up with some ideas of notebook llm styles, visual styles for a video i'll create. and that should

2163
05:00:02,849 --> 05:00:07,069
give me some ideas personalized to me that i can use to start creating these videos. nicolas

2164
05:00:07,069 --> 05:00:11,209
says, oh that's a nice addition to have video styles. just wish it would do british english

2165
05:00:11,209 --> 05:00:15,409
rather than american english voices." hopefully that's coming out soon. i know they've just

2166
05:00:15,409 --> 05:00:21,589
released a bunch of new updates to ai studio where you can essentially plug in different voices.

2167
05:00:21,589 --> 05:00:25,249
some of them are much more realistic than previous, so that's something really cool. and i think

2168
05:00:25,249 --> 05:00:30,589
that'll come to notebook lm too pretty soon. all right, so it's giving us some ideas here. so

2169
05:00:30,589 --> 05:00:36,209
for example, hyper neon cyber lab. let's try that. if we go to video overview style, add a custom.

2170
05:00:36,209 --> 05:00:40,549
you can also auto select, so if you're not sure what to use but you want some ideas, you can

2171
05:00:40,549 --> 05:00:44,649
always just select auto select instead if you want. i'm going to go with custom, and we'll try

2172
05:00:44,649 --> 05:00:50,049
this out. so i'm gonna say hyper neon cyber lab. and then we can give it a specific use case.

2173
05:00:50,049 --> 05:00:54,429
so we could say, okay present this to a book club" or help me review for a quiz" or focus on

2174
05:00:54,429 --> 05:00:59,269
a specific source." right you can also describe the show structure. right so now i'm going to

2175
05:00:59,269 --> 05:01:03,949
say, okay give me some ideas on this for a presentation about plexi seo i'll go back to chat

2176
05:01:03,949 --> 05:01:10,389
gpt and the tab here. we'll plug in the screenshot. i said, give me some actual real use cases

2177
05:01:10,389 --> 05:01:16,989
for a video i can create about plexi ai2o and there we go. it's giving us some ideas here. i'm

2178
05:01:16,989 --> 05:01:23,669
going to say, okay be more in depth in the instructions." so this video is amazing, plus very

2179
05:01:23,669 --> 05:01:28,789
well thought out. there we go. all right, for ai seo workflow breakdown using plexi we'll copy

2180
05:01:28,789 --> 05:01:33,029
that. we'll go back to notebook lm the cool thing about this is you can do it really quickly

2181
05:01:33,029 --> 05:01:36,509
and on the spot. right so if you need inspiration but you want it personalized to you and you

2182
05:01:36,509 --> 05:01:41,289
don't want anything generic, then you can use chat gpt and a combination of notebook lm to help

2183
05:01:41,289 --> 05:01:46,469
you. right we're going to say, okay for a seo breakdown using plexi walk viewers step by step

2184
05:01:46,469 --> 05:01:50,889
through a complete ai powered seo workflow." begin by identifying low competition keywords.

2185
05:01:50,889 --> 05:01:55,929
set up intent. move into creating topic clusters, etc. right and i'll say, yeah that's simplified,

2186
05:01:55,929 --> 05:02:01,589
plus make it very practical." okay so we've got hyper neon cyber lab. we've got these instructions

2187
05:02:01,589 --> 05:02:08,829
right here. i want to say target audience equals entrepreneurs on youtube learning about ai

2188
05:02:08,829 --> 05:02:14,269
seo we'll hit generate. now it's going to generate that video overview based on the we gave

2189
05:02:14,269 --> 05:02:19,009
it. so just to recap here, the two changes that we've walked you through so far. number one,

2190
05:02:19,009 --> 05:02:24,089
deep research. so you can use deep research to generate outputs like you can see over here.

2191
05:02:24,089 --> 05:02:29,569
now the deep research is completed. we can see the research over here. so this is the full research

2192
05:02:29,569 --> 05:02:35,389
report, and then it's also included all the cited sources. so it's automatically loaded 27 sources

2193
05:02:35,389 --> 05:02:40,689
inside our content that we can use to generate this deep research report. now here's the interesting

2194
05:02:40,689 --> 05:02:45,949
thing. we've got a custom trained ai tool that you can create for free that's trained on the

2195
05:02:45,949 --> 05:02:50,729
deep research you've just come up with, which is super powerful. because now the quality of

2196
05:02:50,729 --> 05:02:55,670
your outputs on notebook lm depend on the quality of sources you load in and the research that

2197
05:02:55,670 --> 05:03:00,049
you train it on. right why is that important? it's important because now you've got a custom

2198
05:03:00,049 --> 05:03:05,149
gpt or a notebook lm very similar things that are custom trained on some of the best research

2199
05:03:05,149 --> 05:03:09,309
you could possibly get on that particular topic. right so you can see here that it's loaded

2200
05:03:09,309 --> 05:03:14,289
up all the sources, all the information, etc. and we're going to click on import, and that's

2201
05:03:14,289 --> 05:03:18,789
going to import all of those sources automatically straight into notebook and then we can use

2202
05:03:18,789 --> 05:03:24,409
the chat here, and we can use the audio and video overview with custom styles to generate our

2203
05:03:24,409 --> 05:03:28,269
report. so you can see here the untitled notebook. we can easily change the name of that, and

2204
05:03:28,269 --> 05:03:32,709
you can switch it between default, learning guide, or custom. and you can choose your response

2205
05:03:32,709 --> 05:03:37,549
length, so longer, shorter, etc. and then if you were trying to say keep up with the latest

2206
05:03:37,549 --> 05:03:42,929
ai updates in your industry, you just go down here, start typing, say, okay tell me about the

2207
05:03:42,929 --> 05:03:48,229
new updates this week in ai and now you will never fall behind. now obviously, there are so

2208
05:03:48,229 --> 05:03:51,609
many different tools you could build with this, but this is just one example. for example, i

2209
05:03:51,609 --> 05:03:56,609
previously created a sales trainer that trains my team. they can ask any questions inside the

2210
05:03:56,609 --> 05:04:01,369
notebook lm based on my step-by-step instructions and guide for selling. and then they can go

2211
05:04:01,369 --> 05:04:05,469
inside here and ask questions. right and so you can build a custom ai tool very quickly about

2212
05:04:05,469 --> 05:04:09,989
almost anything that you can think of. it will give you the updates. right so for example here,

2213
05:04:09,989 --> 05:04:15,229
what's happened recently? so it says the updates this week in ai are marked by a critical convergence

2214
05:04:15,229 --> 05:04:19,689
of all this sort of crazy stuff that's going on. so for example, like autonomous cyber risk

2215
05:04:19,689 --> 05:04:25,329
or guardrail evasion. we've got frontier models. right so for example, like badu journey 5 0.

2216
05:04:25,329 --> 05:04:30,309
that literally just came out recently. right i've also got this for all these pieces of information

2217
05:04:30,309 --> 05:04:35,529
too. now this is important too because when i know the ai hallucinates and tends to make up

2218
05:04:35,529 --> 05:04:40,769
a lot of stuff. right, and, so, if you can easily bypass that by creating this sort of content,

2219
05:04:40,769 --> 05:04:44,669
then you're gonna get much better results. right the quality of the results you get from all

2220
05:04:44,669 --> 05:04:49,469
this information is going to be much better because it's based on more accurate data, and it's

2221
05:04:49,469 --> 05:04:53,109
only using the sources that you've custom trained it on, which is great. it's going to save

2222
05:04:53,109 --> 05:04:59,129
you a lot of time. save you a... so for example, also it's talked about claude's 4 5 split and

2223
05:04:59,129 --> 05:05:03,589
the dominance there. open source efficiency that's just improved. some new regulations it just

2224
05:05:03,589 --> 05:05:08,409
came into place, and also the custom ai chip that just came out. right so that just came out

2225
05:05:08,409 --> 05:05:15,209
on november the 14th, and we've also got information about all the latest improvements in the

2226
05:05:15,209 --> 05:05:19,329
industry there. and it said to illustrate the change in irs this week, but here's some examples.

2227
05:05:19,329 --> 05:05:24,009
right now how do we use this information? so we use it inside the chat here, and we can also

2228
05:05:24,009 --> 05:05:29,389
simplify the responses. so if you actually have a look here, like this is not the nicest formatted

2229
05:05:29,389 --> 05:05:35,109
way to receive information, honestly. so i would just change the examples here and just change

2230
05:05:35,109 --> 05:05:40,489
the style and tone to be simpler and easier to understand. right so we could say, okay beautiful

2231
05:05:40,489 --> 05:05:46,949
formatting, easy to understand, add nice emojis, reply simply, make it super practical, and

2232
05:05:46,949 --> 05:05:53,229
explain why these updates are important." and then also simplify the responses to be third grade

2233
05:05:53,229 --> 05:05:56,629
language. now if you want longer responses, you can select there. if you want shorter responses,

2234
05:05:56,629 --> 05:06:00,169
you can go there. but i'm just going to go with the default here. right and then if we hit save,

2235
05:06:00,169 --> 05:06:05,529
we'll say, okay tell me about the new updates this week." wait for that. so now it's using the

2236
05:06:05,529 --> 05:06:10,609
custom instructions to create the answer. right now have a look at these responses, which are

2237
05:06:10,609 --> 05:06:15,969
like super messy, quite difficult to read, not that fun to interact with. and compare it to

2238
05:06:15,969 --> 05:06:20,569
this one, right? where it's got nice headers, it's simplified the language. anyone can read

2239
05:06:20,569 --> 05:06:24,129
that and understand what's going on. and then it also summarizes the updates. it's update three,

2240
05:06:24,129 --> 05:06:29,549
update four, right? update five. so super easy to do. and then from here, we can then start

2241
05:06:29,549 --> 05:06:34,509
generating an audio view based on what's happened. right now inside the audio view here, which

2242
05:06:34,509 --> 05:06:39,109
is basically like generating a podcast with two different people, you can also select the language

2243
05:06:39,109 --> 05:06:43,029
here. so you can create this in german or whatever. you can change it to be short, long, or

2244
05:06:43,029 --> 05:06:47,069
default. and then you can also switch between what you want to talk about. for example, it could

2245
05:06:47,069 --> 05:06:51,969
be deep dive or brief or critique or debate. and then inside this section, you've got the, what

2246
05:06:51,969 --> 05:06:58,989
should the ai host focus on?" right so you can say, okay focus only on the new ai tool updates.

2247
05:06:58,989 --> 05:07:05,909
summarize them so anyone can understand the latest ai updates this week." we'll select sure.

2248
05:07:05,909 --> 05:07:10,269
that's going to make it quicker to generate, also easier to use. and say simplify the language

2249
05:07:10,269 --> 05:07:14,889
so it's fair grade. and then if you want to create a podcast, maybe to embed inside a blog or

2250
05:07:14,889 --> 05:07:19,169
inside your website or share on social media or create on youtube then the way that you do this

2251
05:07:19,169 --> 05:07:23,009
is you'd also say, okay let's say you've got a product and you want to use this commercially."

2252
05:07:23,009 --> 05:07:29,269
right you could say, okay subtly sell the benefits of the profit bordering," and you replace

2253
05:07:29,269 --> 05:07:34,349
this with whatever you want to sell. available and we'll put available at aiprofitbordering.com

2254
05:07:34,349 --> 05:07:40,889
and mention this is the best ai automation community that learn ai automation, get coaching,

2255
05:07:40,889 --> 05:07:47,289
ai coaching and support, plus connect with an amazing community of people. and so now this is

2256
05:07:47,289 --> 05:07:52,629
a very practical use case because we've got a tool that can generate videos, audio views. it

2257
05:07:52,629 --> 05:07:56,189
creates them exactly how we want them to be. we can change the length and the response and the

2258
05:07:56,189 --> 05:08:00,349
style of the language. and then we can also use that as a sales tool for our business so that

2259
05:08:00,349 --> 05:08:05,129
we can generate and sell whatever we want to do. so if we hit generate, so that's now going

2260
05:08:05,129 --> 05:08:09,429
to generate an audio overview, which we can come back to in a minute. it's pretty simple and

2261
05:08:09,429 --> 05:08:13,129
easy to do. right doesn't take a long time at all. we've got the deep research report ready

2262
05:08:13,129 --> 05:08:16,929
here. it has failed to bring in a few, so you can see here is actually failed to bring this

2263
05:08:16,929 --> 05:08:21,689
in. says invalid url but that's okay because we've got so many resources from the deep research

2264
05:08:21,689 --> 05:08:25,589
report. we can use those to generate more, and it doesn't really matter if some of them don't

2265
05:08:25,589 --> 05:08:29,409
work. we're playing the numbers game, and we're generating so many inputs. so that's the deep

2266
05:08:29,409 --> 05:08:34,109
research. that's how to generate the audio views based on exactly what we want. we've got the

2267
05:08:34,109 --> 05:08:38,369
video overview as well, but still generating, so that might take about five, ten, twenty minutes

2268
05:08:38,369 --> 05:08:43,609
to generate. actually when we come to video views, the final update that we have is the chat

2269
05:08:43,609 --> 05:08:48,289
history. right so you can close the session and resume it later. how do you do that? let me

2270
05:08:48,289 --> 05:08:52,789
show you. so if we go back to notebook lm over here, we've got a bunch of options. right so

2271
05:08:52,789 --> 05:08:56,489
for example, we've got my notebooks, featured notebooks, shared with me, and then we should

2272
05:08:56,489 --> 05:09:01,989
be able to come back to history. now when i actually check notebook lm i can't see this option

2273
05:09:01,989 --> 05:09:05,889
inside notebook lm so it's just something to be aware of. maybe it's still rolling out. you

2274
05:09:05,889 --> 05:09:09,729
can see it as chat history is rolling out now, so maybe that's coming to more people later.

2275
05:09:09,729 --> 05:09:14,249
i actually can't see it, to be honest with you, but that should appear inside the history here.

2276
05:09:14,249 --> 05:09:20,169
let's have a look inside notebook lm if we actually click off that, and then we go back to the

2277
05:09:20,169 --> 05:09:24,469
notebook lm you can actually see the history inside the chat here, which is great. so basically

2278
05:09:24,469 --> 05:09:29,949
what that new update is allowed is all the interactions that you have with the ai it actually

2279
05:09:29,949 --> 05:09:34,149
saves, and then you can see the previous responses. right you can come back to those and search

2280
05:09:34,149 --> 05:09:38,589
through them and find previous options. whereas normally, if you came back to a notebook lm

2281
05:09:38,589 --> 05:09:42,909
like you've created here, it would start from scratch. right you wouldn't have any history on

2282
05:09:42,909 --> 05:09:46,229
that. i wonder if that's tracked it for old ones as well. so let's have a look here. we'll have

2283
05:09:46,229 --> 05:09:50,249
a look at this one. yeah so you see how it's not got any information or previous responses.

2284
05:09:50,249 --> 05:09:54,549
let's have a look at this one. yeah so you can see it's not saving the old chat history. it's

2285
05:09:54,549 --> 05:09:58,649
just for the new ones it creates, if that makes sense. a pretty cool update. lots of cool stuff

2286
05:09:58,649 --> 05:10:02,749
right there. seems really easy to use as well. and then we've got some other cool stuff here.

2287
05:10:02,749 --> 05:10:06,289
now at the top, you also got featured notebooks, so you can check out all this stuff. but you've

2288
05:10:06,289 --> 05:10:10,649
also got the notebooks that you've created. right so this is like all of the notebooks, including

2289
05:10:10,649 --> 05:10:14,889
the featured ones. but you can switch to my notebooks, and then you can see all of these previous

2290
05:10:14,889 --> 05:10:19,169
notebooks that we've created. so for example, we've got the account managers growth playbook.

2291
05:10:19,169 --> 05:10:24,189
we have the advanced sales operating procedure notebook, lm, right, so. this is the tool that

2292
05:10:24,189 --> 05:10:28,149
i was talking about before that we use to actually train our team. now if we go to one of these

2293
05:10:28,149 --> 05:10:32,289
videos on the right, these were old videos i've generated, but they're still pretty cool. so

2294
05:10:32,289 --> 05:10:36,349
for example, if i click on this one, i won't play the sound back because it probably doesn't

2295
05:10:36,349 --> 05:10:40,109
sound good on the live stream. but we can play. today we're gonna do something a little different.

2296
05:10:40,109 --> 05:10:44,409
we got our hands on an actual internal textbook theory. okay it's the question every single

2297
05:10:44,409 --> 05:10:48,529
sales leader on the planet wants to answer. and well the answer might not be what you think.

2298
05:10:48,529 --> 05:10:53,009
here's the thing. according to this playbook, the secret isn't some clever script or fancy new

2299
05:10:53,009 --> 05:10:58,089
piece of software. it all starts with a very specific and frankly an incredibly intense philosophy.

2300
05:10:58,089 --> 05:11:02,329
this is the engine that makes the whole thing go. and just to be clear, this isn't some motivational

2301
05:11:02,329 --> 05:11:07,789
poster on the wall. no the document makes one thing crystal clear. this number is the... now

2302
05:11:07,789 --> 05:11:12,949
we have our explainer video ready to go as well. so if we go back to our explainer video, we

2303
05:11:12,949 --> 05:11:16,829
have this ready on the right-hand side over here. so let's play that back now. so open this

2304
05:11:16,829 --> 05:11:22,889
up. this is a custom style video that... all right, let's get right into it. let's listen to

2305
05:11:22,889 --> 05:11:27,349
this. all right, let's get right into it. today we are breaking down a complete practical ai

2306
05:11:27,349 --> 05:11:32,109
seo workflow that is built from the ground up for solopreneurs. seriously this isn't just theory.

2307
05:11:32,109 --> 05:11:36,569
it's a system you can actually use to start ranking and getting traffic in this totally new

2308
05:11:36,569 --> 05:11:41,749
era of search, all by using tools like perplexity. and you know what? that is not an exaggeration.

2309
05:11:41,749 --> 05:11:47,109
the stuff we're about to cover is so new it gives you a massive advantage. while everybody else

2310
05:11:47,109 --> 05:11:51,329
is out there fighting the old seo war, you're about to learn the rules to a whole new game.

2311
05:11:51,329 --> 05:11:56,269
so that's using that cyber robot ai style that we asked it to do with the neon style. so you

2312
05:11:56,269 --> 05:11:59,949
can see that in the background here, and it's created a really nice hook, but it's very simplified.

2313
05:11:59,949 --> 05:12:04,809
right so it's okay. 99% of your competitors have no clue. it almost feels like a bsl or a video

2314
05:12:04,809 --> 05:12:09,149
sales letter that's selling that process, keeping people interested. we've generated the whole

2315
05:12:09,149 --> 05:12:13,729
video, and what i think it's taken about 20-25 minutes to run through. so let's keep going through.

2316
05:12:13,729 --> 05:12:18,349
and if you're wondering, does this stuff actually work? just look at this number. this is real

2317
05:12:18,349 --> 05:12:24,769
traffic to a real site that went from absolutely nothing to 87,000 visitors in just a few days.

2318
05:12:24,769 --> 05:12:30,169
how by using one specific feature in perplexity. this is the kind of wild growth that's suddenly

2319
05:12:30,169 --> 05:12:35,029
possible. so let's set the stage here. to win today, you have to get your head around the fact

2320
05:12:35,029 --> 05:12:39,229
that the entire... i actually don't, i don't like that style that much, but i think it is cool

2321
05:12:39,229 --> 05:12:42,489
to test it out and see what it's like. and i think you could have a lot of plays around with

2322
05:12:42,489 --> 05:12:45,809
that. right you could you could mess around, and then once you finally find something that you

2323
05:12:45,809 --> 05:12:49,909
like, you can save the preset and come back to it later. so let's keep playing. now foundation

2324
05:12:49,909 --> 05:12:55,409
of seo is shifting like right now, right under our feet. okay let's break this down. think about

2325
05:12:55,409 --> 05:12:59,489
it. old and then it talks about the old way and the new way as well. right so here's the old

2326
05:12:59,489 --> 05:13:04,429
style of seo here's a new way of seo so it's really cool. all of these slides were automated.

2327
05:13:04,429 --> 05:13:10,249
the style was custom preset to what we want. the content itself is optimized to exactly how

2328
05:13:10,249 --> 05:13:15,909
we wanted it. it's a six-minute video, very in-depth, very easy to understand, nicely narrated.

2329
05:13:15,909 --> 05:13:18,929
i don't think it's mentioned that our profit volume is... that's the only issue that would...

2330
05:13:18,929 --> 05:13:23,269
a whole cluster of articles around one topic makes... see that? but it's still pretty good.

2331
05:13:23,269 --> 05:13:27,209
and then you can show the prompt here. this you can see the example right here of the content

2332
05:13:27,209 --> 05:13:32,949
that we've created. and then we also have the audio overview over here. so this is the podcast

2333
05:13:32,949 --> 05:13:37,729
will be generated with the new ai updates. so let's play this one back. welcome our mission

2334
05:13:37,729 --> 05:13:45,449
today is a fast, clear deep dive into the absolute must-know ai tool updates this week. we've

2335
05:13:45,449 --> 05:13:49,669
sifted through all the research and news articles to pull out what really matters for you. and

2336
05:13:49,669 --> 05:13:53,829
it's moving so fast, almost impossible to keep up. it really is. so we're going to... simple

2337
05:13:53,829 --> 05:13:57,829
so this is the one based on deep research. as you can see, we've got the sources on the left.

2338
05:13:57,829 --> 05:14:03,229
we've got custom notebook lm inside here, and then we have the podcast over here. right now

2339
05:14:03,229 --> 05:14:08,169
this is actually interactive as well. so we could go inside here, and in interactive mode, we

2340
05:14:08,169 --> 05:14:12,149
can actually interact with the podcast itself and ask any questions. so let's play it. welcome

2341
05:14:12,149 --> 05:14:19,789
our mission today is a fast, clear deep dive into the absolute must-know ai tool updates this

2342
05:14:19,789 --> 05:14:24,649
week. we've sifted through all the research and news articles to pull out what really matters

2343
05:14:24,649 --> 05:14:30,969
for you. and it is moving so fast. hey our listener wants to join in. what's up? hey so i wanted

2344
05:14:30,969 --> 05:14:35,309
to ask, what are the new updates this week? could you summarize them in 10 to 20 words? oh that's

2345
05:14:35,309 --> 05:14:39,069
a great question. you want the whole thing in a tight nutshell? let's unpack this quick summary.

2346
05:14:39,069 --> 05:14:44,809
absolutely the biggest updates are new omnimodal models, ernie 5 0 agents are taking over 90%

2347
05:14:44,809 --> 05:14:51,609
of cyber attacks, plus custom ai chips and california's new frontier model regulation. that's

2348
05:14:51,609 --> 05:14:56,099
the core. so you can see here how you can actually interact. ask questions with your microphone.

2349
05:14:56,099 --> 05:15:00,059
talk to the ai ask it for exactly what you want, and then it'll get back to you straight away.

2350
05:15:00,059 --> 05:15:04,799
so there's some really cool stuff right there. just to recap, you've got deep research ready

2351
05:15:04,799 --> 05:15:10,999
to go. you have the custom video overviews generated as well. and then you have the chat history

2352
05:15:10,999 --> 05:15:16,959

2381
05:17:23,219 --> 05:17:29,199
it for you. right so that's a full process right there. this free tool just changed everything for SEO content.

2382
05:17:29,199 --> 05:17:34,039
I'm about to show you how to turn a couple PDFs into a video-making machine. and there's one

2383
05:17:34,039 --> 05:17:38,379
hidden trick at the end that's gonna blow your mind. this works for any niche, and it takes

2384
05:17:38,379 --> 05:17:42,979
like 10 minutes to set up. let's go. so here's what's wild about notebook LM. it's completely free.

2385
05:17:42,979 --> 05:17:47,679
Google made it, and nobody's talking about the SEO angle. everyone's using it for research,

2386
05:17:47,679 --> 05:17:52,619
but I'm gonna show you how to use it to steal traffic and rank videos faster than ever before.

2387
05:17:52,619 --> 05:17:58,119
this tool does something crazy. you upload a few files. could be PDFs, could be Google Docs,

2388
05:17:58,119 --> 05:18:02,619
could be blog posts, and it gives you everything you need for a video: the script, the keywords,

2389
05:18:02,619 --> 05:18:05,439
the chapters, even the slides, all from those files.

2390
05:18:05,439 --> 05:18:10,279
I'm gonna walk you through this step by step using a real example, so you can copy this exact

2391
05:18:10,279 --> 05:18:15,439
process. and here's the thing: this isn't some complicated workflow. it's literally seven prompts.

2392
05:18:15,439 --> 05:18:20,799
that's it. seven prompts, and you go from random documents to a complete video ready to upload.

2393
05:18:20,799 --> 05:18:26,079
I'm using fitness content as my example today, but this works for anything: real estate, SaaS,

2394
05:18:26,079 --> 05:18:30,919
ecommerce, coaching, doesn't matter. first thing you need to do is prep your files. this is

2395
05:18:30,919 --> 05:18:36,299
step zero. go find two or three sources about your topic. for me, I grabbed a PDF called beginner

2396
05:18:36,299 --> 05:18:41,619
fitness plan. then I found a blog post about seven-day home workouts, and I added a Google Doc

2397
05:18:41,619 --> 05:18:47,459
with nutrition basics. that's it. three simple sources. now here's why this matters. notebook

2398
05:18:47,459 --> 05:18:53,399
LM works best when you give it a focused content, not hundred random files. just two or three

2399
05:18:53,399 --> 05:18:58,399
good ones that cover your topic. this keeps the output tight and relevant. now you're going

2400
05:18:58,399 --> 05:19:04,319
to create a notebook in notebook LM and upload those files. super easy. just drag and drop.

2401
05:19:04,319 --> 05:19:09,219
once they're in, you're gonna use your first prompt, and this prompt sets up everything that

2402
05:19:09,219 --> 05:19:12,179
comes after. here's what you say: you are my research assistant.

2403
05:19:12,179 --> 05:19:17,539
I uploaded three sources about a beginner fitness plan. give me a concise three-paragraph summary

2404
05:19:17,539 --> 05:19:22,539
that highlights the goal for a four-week beginner fitness plan, seven proven exercise types

2405
05:19:22,539 --> 05:19:28,359
to include, and five nutrition do's and don'ts. use bullet points for the exercise types and

2406
05:19:28,359 --> 05:19:33,519
nutrition tips. that's it. hit enter, and notebook LM gives you this beautiful summary: clean,

2407
05:19:33,519 --> 05:19:38,059
organized, ready to work with. and if you want our team to help you scale this even further,

2408
05:19:38,059 --> 05:19:43,719
we're offering free SEO strategy sessions. and I mean actually free, no catch, no pressure.

2409
05:19:43,719 --> 05:19:48,819
we'll jump on a call with you and show you exactly how to use systems like this to grow your

2410
05:19:48,819 --> 05:19:53,599
business. we'll look at your specific situation, your niche, your competition, and we'll map

2411
05:19:53,599 --> 05:19:58,039
out a plan that works for you. real strategies, real tactics, the same stuff we use with our

2412
05:19:58,039 --> 05:20:03,779
paying clients. no pitch, no sales nonsense, just value. because we know if we help you get

2413
05:20:03,779 --> 05:20:08,219
results, you'll remember us. the link is in the comments and description. now here's where it

2414
05:20:08,219 --> 05:20:13,239
gets good. you're going to extract SEO keywords from that summary. this is prompt 2, and it's

2415
05:20:13,239 --> 05:20:17,659
going to give you everything you need for YouTube. here's the prompt: using your summary above,

2416
05:20:17,659 --> 05:20:23,499
extract 30 SEO keywords and group them by intent: informational, commercial, and navigational.

2417
05:20:23,499 --> 05:20:28,899
make the suggestions targeted to beginners searching about fitness plan for beginners and mark

2418
05:20:28,899 --> 05:20:35,279
the top 7 as priority keywords. also suggest six short clickable YouTube title variants that

2419
05:20:35,279 --> 05:20:41,319
include at least one top keyword. boom notebook LM spits out 30 keywords organized by intent.

2420
05:20:41,319 --> 05:20:46,439
plus it gives you six ready-to-use titles. this is insane because you're not guessing anymore.

2421
05:20:46,439 --> 05:20:51,279
the keywords come straight from your content, so they're relevant, they're natural, and they're

2422
05:20:51,279 --> 05:20:57,279
going to help you rank. but wait, it gets better. now you're going to turn those keywords into

2423
05:20:57,279 --> 05:21:02,999
a full video script. this is prompt 3, and this is where notebook LM becomes your writer. here's

2424
05:21:02,999 --> 05:21:09,759
what you say: I using the top 7 priority keywords you chose, write a punchy 4-minute video script

2425
05:21:09,759 --> 05:21:15,399
with a 7-second hook, three short bullets for the first minute, demo one mini case example for

2426
05:21:15,399 --> 05:21:21,739
a 21-year-old beginner, and a 15-second CTA. include on screen text cues and suggest six chapter

2427
05:21:21,739 --> 05:21:26,839
titles for YouTube timestamps. keep sentences short and energetic. and just like that, you have

2428
05:21:26,839 --> 05:21:31,759
a script with a hook, with timestamps, with examples, everything you need to record. no more

2429
05:21:31,759 --> 05:21:36,659
staring at a blank page. no more writer's block. just copy the script and start filming. now

2430
05:21:36,659 --> 05:21:42,119
here's the part that blew my mind. notebook LM has this feature called video overview, and most

2431
05:21:42,119 --> 05:21:47,159
people don't even know it exists. but this is a game changer. you can actually create a narrated

2432
05:21:47,159 --> 05:21:53,119
slideshow inside notebook LM and then export it. so his prompt: for create a video overview

2433
05:21:53,119 --> 05:21:58,939
from the notebook title problem: four-week plan split into weeks and goals, seven core exercises

2434
05:21:58,939 --> 05:22:05,079
itemized, sample meal plan, and CTA for each slide. provide a 10 to 20-second narration and

2435
05:22:05,079 --> 05:22:10,239
suggested visual, like an image or diagram or short clip, and list three royalty-free image

2436
05:22:10,239 --> 05:22:15,759
keywords to use. notebook LM builds the whole thing for you: slides, narration, even tells you

2437
05:22:15,759 --> 05:22:21,099
what images to find. you can literally use this as your video or use it as b-roll or turn it

2438
05:22:21,099 --> 05:22:26,019
into shorts. the options are endless. alright so you've got your script, you've got your slides.

2439
05:22:26,019 --> 05:22:30,779
now you need to optimize for YouTube. this is where most people drop the ball. they make great

2440
05:22:30,779 --> 05:22:35,319
content, but nobody finds it. not you. you're going to use prompt 5, and this gives you all

2441
05:22:35,319 --> 05:22:41,679
the metadata you need. is the prompt: from the video script and the top priority keywords, write

2442
05:22:41,679 --> 05:22:47,959
a 100-character clickbait but accurate title, a compelling 150-word YouTube description that

2443
05:22:47,959 --> 05:22:53,559
includes three priority keywords in the first 50 words, 15 tags, comma-separated, and 6 timestamp

2444
05:22:53,559 --> 05:22:58,879
chapter lines. make the description short, punchy, and include a CTA to the pinned comment where

2445
05:22:58,879 --> 05:23:05,239
the notebook LM links are. copy this into your YouTube upload: title, description, tags, chapters.

2446
05:23:05,239 --> 05:23:09,959
everything is done, and it's all SEO optimized because it came from your content and your keywords.

2447
05:23:09,959 --> 05:23:15,999
now we're going to talk about the real hack, the thing nobody's doing. you're going to repurpose

2448
05:23:15,999 --> 05:23:21,539
this into shorts. this is prompt 6, and this is how you 10x your reach. here's what you say:

2449
05:23:21,539 --> 05:23:26,079
create three 60-second short scripts, each with an opening line, three quick facts from the

2450
05:23:26,079 --> 05:23:31,479
video, and a one-line CTA. then write six Instagram and Twitter captions, one sentence each,

2451
05:23:31,479 --> 05:23:37,019
punchy, each including one of the priority keywords and an emoji. keep captions line broken

2452
05:23:37,019 --> 05:23:42,219
and snappy. now you've got three shorts, six social posts, all from the same content. and here's

2453
05:23:42,219 --> 05:23:47,259
what happens: the shorts drive traffic to the main video. the social posts drive traffic to

2454
05:23:47,259 --> 05:23:52,379
the shorts. everything feeds everything else. this is how you dominate the topic. but we're

2455
05:23:52,379 --> 05:23:59,059
not done yet. there's one more prompt, and this one is for the SEO nerds. prompt 7: produce

2456
05:23:59,059 --> 05:24:05,079
a full transcript cleaned and extract the top 10 people also our style questions with one sentence

2457
05:24:05,079 --> 05:24:08,839
answers. we can put in the pinned comment and description for SEO. this does two things. first

2458
05:24:08,839 --> 05:24:13,719
the transcript helps YouTube understand your video better. understanding means better rankings.

2459
05:24:13,719 --> 05:24:18,959
second those 10 questions go in your pinned comment, and when people search those questions,

2460
05:24:18,959 --> 05:24:23,779
your video shows up. this is free traffic from people actively looking for answers, and you

2461
05:24:23,779 --> 05:24:29,259
just gave YouTube exactly what it needs to rank you. so here's my challenge to you: go try this

2462
05:24:29,259 --> 05:24:34,399
today. pick one topic, run through the seven prompts, make one video, and then come back and

2463
05:24:34,399 --> 05:24:39,259
tell me how it went. drop a comment below. tell me what worked, tell me what didn't, tell me

2464
05:24:39,259 --> 05:24:44,119
what you learned because this is just the beginning. notebook LM is going to keep getting better.

2465
05:24:44,119 --> 05:24:48,639
AI tools are going to keep getting better, and the people who learn how to use them are going

2466
05:24:48,639 --> 05:24:54,599
to dominate. so get in now, test it, break it, figure out what works for your niche, and then

2467
05:24:54,599 --> 05:24:59,039
scale it because this is the future of content creation, and you're either in or you're out.

2468
05:24:59,039 --> 05:25:05,299
and if you want our team to help you scale this even further, we're offering free SEO strategy

2469
05:25:05,299 --> 05:25:10,259
sessions. and I mean actually free, no catch, no pressure. we'll jump on a call with you and

2470
05:25:10,259 --> 05:25:15,359
show you exactly how to use systems like this to grow your business. we'll look at your specific

2471
05:25:15,359 --> 05:25:20,599
situation, your niche, your competition, and we'll map out a plan that works for you. real strategies,

2472
05:25:20,599 --> 05:25:25,899
real tactics, the same stuff we use with our paying clients. no pitch, no sales nonsense, just

2473
05:25:25,899 --> 05:25:30,779
value because we know if we help you get results, you'll remember us. the link is in the comments

2474
05:25:30,779 --> 05:25:36,699
and description. if you want to go even deeper with AI and SEO, join SEO elite circle. rank

2475
05:25:36,699 --> 05:25:41,399
number one, get more customers, and steal the exact systems we're using to scale past eight

2476
05:25:41,399 --> 05:25:46,199
figures. this is where I share everything: the strategies, the tools, the workflows, the stuff

2477
05:25:46,199 --> 05:25:48,959
that's actually working right now, not theory, not fluff.

2478
05:25:48,959 --> 05:25:55,059
Google just dropped something wild. notebook LM now shows math like a textbook. no more messy

2479
05:25:55,059 --> 05:26:01,039
code. this is the update students have been begging for. notebook LM just added native latex

2480
05:26:01,039 --> 05:26:05,859
rendering, and if you don't know what that means, stick with me because this is huge for anyone

2481
05:26:05,859 --> 05:26:10,979
studying math, science, engineering, or anything with equations. before this update, if you

2482
05:26:10,979 --> 05:26:17,399
tried to study math in notebook LM, you'd see ugly code like backslash int underscore a to the

2483
05:26:17,399 --> 05:26:21,379
power of B dollar signs everywhere. it looked like a computer threw up on your screen. you couldn't

2484
05:26:21,379 --> 05:26:26,119
read it, you couldn't study from it, it was a mess. now everything changed. those same equations

2485
05:26:26,119 --> 05:26:30,959
show up clean, beautiful, just like they do in your textbook. we're talking proper fractions,

2486
05:26:30,959 --> 05:26:36,199
integrals that actually look like integrals, quadratic formulas that make sense. this works

2487
05:26:36,199 --> 05:26:40,959
in chat, flashcards, and quizzes, all of them native support across the board. and here's why

2488
05:26:40,959 --> 05:26:45,619
this matters: when you're studying for an exam, the last thing you need is to decode what your

2489
05:26:45,619 --> 05:26:50,299
notes mean. you need clear equations. you need to see the math the way it's supposed to look,

2490
05:26:50,299 --> 05:26:55,419
and now notebook LM does that automatically. upload your notes, and boom! let me show you how

2491
05:26:55,419 --> 05:26:59,759
this actually works in practice. you take your messy math notes, the ones with all the raw latex

2492
05:26:59,759 --> 05:27:04,399
code, and you paste them into notebook LM. maybe it's an integral, maybe it's a complex formula,

2493
05:27:04,399 --> 05:27:10,079
doesn't matter. notebook LM reads it and displays it perfectly. no guessing, no squinting, just

2494
05:27:10,079 --> 05:27:14,299
clean readable math that you can actually study from. but here's where it gets really good:

2495
05:27:14,299 --> 05:27:19,219
the flashcards. this is the game changer. you upload a PDF or your type notes that have equations

2496
05:27:19,219 --> 05:27:24,639
in them. then you tell notebook LM to generate flashcards, and what you get back are study cards

2497
05:27:24,639 --> 05:27:31,939
with perfectly formatted equations. front of the card has a question, back has the answer with

2498
05:27:31,939 --> 05:27:37,059
the formula looking exactly like it should. no more raw code, no more confusion. same thing

2499
05:27:37,059 --> 05:27:40,959
with quizzes. you can generate practice questions from your notes, and if those questions involve

2500
05:27:40,959 --> 05:27:45,639
math, the equations show up clean. this means you can actually test yourself properly. you see

2501
05:27:45,639 --> 05:27:49,759
a question with a nice equation, you solve it, you check your answer. everything flows the way

2502
05:27:49,759 --> 05:27:54,719
studying should flow. now if you want to take this even further and learn how to use AI to actually

2503
05:27:54,719 --> 05:27:59,239
scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with automation, you need

2504
05:27:59,239 --> 05:28:04,719
to join my AI profit boardroom. this is where I show you exactly how to use tools like notebook

2505
05:28:04,719 --> 05:28:10,619
LM and dozens of other AI platforms to build real systems. we're talking lead generation, customer

2506
05:28:10,619 --> 05:28:16,379
service, content creation, all automated with AI. this isn't theory. this is stuff my agency

2507
05:28:16,379 --> 05:28:21,939
uses every single day to serve clients. so back at it. this isn't just about looking pretty.

2508
05:28:21,939 --> 05:28:26,679
this is about fewer mistakes. and when you're studying and you see a messy equation, you might

2509
05:28:26,679 --> 05:28:31,499
copy it wrong. you might miss a subscript. you might read a variable incorrectly. but when the

2510
05:28:31,499 --> 05:28:36,199
math is rendered properly, you see exactly what you need to see. your brain processes it faster.

2511
05:28:36,199 --> 05:28:41,479
you make fewer errors. your study sessions become way more effective. so back at it. teachers

2512
05:28:41,479 --> 05:28:46,579
love this too. if you're an educator, you can now share study sets with your students that actually

2513
05:28:46,579 --> 05:28:51,419
look professional. no more apologizing for the formatting. no more saying ignore the dollar

2514
05:28:51,419 --> 05:28:56,659
signs. you just share clean content that students can actually use. and for test prep, this

2515
05:28:56,659 --> 05:29:01,819
is huge. formulas appear in your flashcards exactly like they appear in textbooks. so when you

2516
05:29:01,819 --> 05:29:06,100
sit down for your exam, nothing looks unfamiliar. you've been studying with properly formatted

2517
05:29:06,100 --> 05:29:10,920
equations the whole time. your brain recognizes everything instantly. now let me give you some

2518
05:29:10,920 --> 05:29:14,879
practical tips because there are a few things you need to know to get the most out of this.

2519
05:29:14,879 --> 05:29:19,960
first there's a difference between inline math and display math. inline math is when you have

2520
05:29:19,960 --> 05:29:24,460
a small equation in the middle of a sentence, like X squared. display math is when you have

2521
05:29:24,460 --> 05:29:29,540
a big formula on its own line, like a long integral. notebook LM handles both, but knowing this

2522
05:29:29,540 --> 05:29:34,300
helps you format your flashcards better. if you have a long formula, give it space. let it display

2523
05:29:34,300 --> 05:29:39,920
properly. second tip: if you have older notebooks in notebook LM from before this update, they

2524
05:29:39,920 --> 05:29:46,420
might still show the fix. is simple: just reupload your notes or rerun the flashcard generation.

2525
05:29:46,420 --> 05:29:50,780
that's it. notebook LM will process them with the new rendering, and everything will look clean.

2526
05:29:50,780 --> 05:29:57,060
third thing you should know before this update, some people were using community scripts and

2527
05:29:57,060 --> 05:30:02,540
browser extensions to fake latex rendering. they had to install extra stuff just to make their

2528
05:30:02,540 --> 05:30:07,480
math readable. now you don't need any of that. it's all native. it's all built in. google did

2529
05:30:07,480 --> 05:30:12,780
it properly. so if you're using those workarounds, you can drop them now. let me give you some

2530
05:30:12,780 --> 05:30:20,540
real use cases because this opens up so many possibilities. say you're studying calculus. you

2531
05:30:20,540 --> 05:30:26,760
can make a study pack with 30 flashcards covering integration basics. each card has clean integrals,

2532
05:30:26,760 --> 05:30:31,460
limits, derivatives. you go through them. you drill the concepts. everything looks professional.

2533
05:30:31,460 --> 05:30:35,940
or maybe you have a midterm coming up. you take your lecture notes, upload them to notebook

2534
05:30:35,940 --> 05:30:42,000
LM, and generate a 10-question practice quiz. every question with math in it displays perfectly.

2535
05:30:42,000 --> 05:30:46,800
you take the quiz, you see where you're weak, you go back and study those areas. it's a complete

2536
05:30:46,800 --> 05:30:54,160
study system now. and here's something cool. notebook LM also does audio overviews for some

2537
05:30:54,160 --> 05:30:59,000
content. so you could potentially generate flashcards with equations, study them visually, then

2538
05:30:59,000 --> 05:31:04,580
listen to an audio overview of the core concepts. it's all connected. it's a full learning ecosystem

2539
05:31:04,580 --> 05:31:09,780
now, not just a note-taking tool. this update is part of a bigger push google made in fall 2025.

2540
05:31:09,780 --> 05:31:15,180
they've been expanding notebook LM's study features across the board: flashcards, quizzes, video

2541
05:31:15,180 --> 05:31:20,140
support, audio support, and now latex rendering fits right into that toolset. it's not just

2542
05:31:20,140 --> 05:31:25,579
one feature in isolation. it's part of making notebook LM a serious study platform. and the

2543
05:31:25,579 --> 05:31:30,960
community has been asking for this forever. if you go on reddit or twitter students have been

2544
05:31:30,960 --> 05:31:34,979
begging for math rendering in notebook LM. people were sharing workarounds, writing scripts,

2545
05:31:34,979 --> 05:31:39,839
trying to hack it together. now google listened and made it official. that's how you know it's

2546
05:31:39,839 --> 05:31:44,339
a real problem that needed solving. alright so here's what I want you to do. if you're studying

2547
05:31:44,339 --> 05:31:49,059
anything with math, try this with your notes. upload them to notebook LM, generate some flashcards,

2548
05:31:49,059 --> 05:31:54,860
generate a quiz, see how clean everything looks. now you can even export study sets and share

2549
05:31:54,860 --> 05:32:00,100
them with classmates. make your whole study group more effective. and listen, you can also repackage

2550
05:32:00,100 --> 05:32:05,239
this content. if you're a creator, take a 30-second clip showing the before and after of latex

2551
05:32:05,239 --> 05:32:11,539
rendering. post it on tiktok make a 60-second instagram reel with a split screen. create a youtube

2552
05:32:11,539 --> 05:32:16,780
short walking through one flashcard example. this update is visual. it's easy to show. and people

2553
05:32:16,780 --> 05:32:22,000
need to know about it. the reality is AI tools are getting better every single week. notebook

2554
05:32:22,000 --> 05:32:27,320
LM just made studying easier for millions of students. and if you're not keeping up with these

2555
05:32:27,320 --> 05:32:32,440
updates, you're falling behind. whether you're a student, a teacher, or someone building a business,

2556
05:32:32,440 --> 05:32:36,940
you need to know what's possible now. now if you want to take this even further and learn how

2557
05:32:36,940 --> 05:32:41,980
to use AI to actually scale your business, get more customers, and save hundreds of hours with

2558
05:32:41,980 --> 05:32:47,160
automation, you need to join my AI profit boardroom. ever want to make audio in different languages

2559
05:32:47,160 --> 05:32:52,600
with just one click? notebook LM just dropped something crazy. you can now make multiple audio

2560
05:32:52,600 --> 05:32:58,540
versions of your notes: different languages, different lengths, different tones, all from one

2561
05:32:58,540 --> 05:33:02,420
notebook. this is huge, and I'm going to show you exactly how to use it.

2562
05:33:02,420 --> 05:33:07,180
Google just changed everything with notebook LM. the mobile app got a massive update. the new

2563
05:33:07,180 --> 05:33:11,740
studio design is here. you can now create as many audio versions as you want from one notebook.

2564
05:33:11,740 --> 05:33:16,340
think about that: one notebook, 10 different audio versions, each one custom made for different

2565
05:33:16,340 --> 05:33:21,180
people. this wasn't possible before. now it is. here's what the new studio design does. you

2566
05:33:21,180 --> 05:33:26,600
can make multiple audio overviews from the same notebook. each one can be in a different language:

2567
05:33:26,600 --> 05:33:31,140
Spanish, French, German, Chinese, whatever you need. you can also change the length of each

2568
05:33:31,140 --> 05:33:36,200
audio. want a quick 2-minute summary? done need a deep 10-minute breakdown? easy and here's

2569
05:33:36,200 --> 05:33:40,800
the best part: you can customize the tone too. make it formal for business. make it casual for

2570
05:33:40,800 --> 05:33:44,740
friends. make it whatever fits your audience. this is all happening in the new studio design.

2571
05:33:44,740 --> 05:33:49,460
it's built right into the mobile app. you open your notebook, and boom, there's the studio.

2572
05:33:49,460 --> 05:33:55,060
you're a researcher. you have a paper in one notebook. make a formal audio overview for your

2573
05:33:55,060 --> 05:34:00,200
colleagues. make a simple audio overview for the general public. make audio overviews in 5 different

2574
05:34:00,200 --> 05:34:05,320
languages for international conferences. one notebook, 5 audio overviews, zero extra work. that's

2575
05:34:05,320 --> 05:34:09,560
what the studio design gives you. you're running a business. you have training materials in

2576
05:34:09,560 --> 05:34:14,820
a notebook. make a professional audio overview for new employees. make a casual audio overview

2577
05:34:14,820 --> 05:34:20,380
for team meetings. make short audio overviews for busy managers. make detailed audio overviews

2578
05:34:20,380 --> 05:34:25,100
for specialists. same notebook, different audio formats. everyone gets exactly what they need.

2579
05:34:25,100 --> 05:34:31,140
here's how you actually use the new studio design. open the notebook LM mobile app. go to your

2580
05:34:31,140 --> 05:34:35,400
notebook. you'll see the studio at the top. click it. now you'll see the option to create a

2581
05:34:35,400 --> 05:34:40,460
new audio overview. click that. pick your language from the drop-down menu. choose your length

2582
05:34:40,460 --> 05:34:45,220
for this audio overview: short, medium, long. then adjust the tone: formal, neutral, casual.

2583
05:34:45,220 --> 05:34:50,200
hit generate. wait about 30 seconds. done your first custom audio overview is ready. want to

2584
05:34:50,200 --> 05:34:55,220
make another audio overview from the same notebook? just repeat those steps in the studio: different

2585
05:34:55,220 --> 05:34:59,560
language, different length, different tone. make as many audio overviews as you want. they all

2586
05:34:59,560 --> 05:35:04,180
save in your studio. you can play them back anytime, share them with anyone, download them if

2587
05:35:04,180 --> 05:35:09,460
you need to. that's the power of multiple audio overviews per notebook. the speed of creating

2588
05:35:09,460 --> 05:35:15,280
multiple audio overviews is what gets me. 30 seconds per audio, that's all it takes. think about

2589
05:35:15,280 --> 05:35:20,300
recording audio yourself for each version. you'd need scripts, a microphone, editing software,

2590
05:35:20,300 --> 05:35:25,980
multiple takes for each version, fixing mistakes, processing each audio. that's hours of work.

2591
05:35:25,980 --> 05:35:30,800
the studio design does it in 30 seconds per audio overview, and each one sounds natural. no

2592
05:35:30,800 --> 05:35:36,180
robot voice, no weird pauses, just smooth professional audio overviews. and here's where the

2593
05:35:36,180 --> 05:35:41,740
studio design gets really good. the quality is consistent across all your audio overviews. every

2594
05:35:41,740 --> 05:35:46,460
audio sounds professional. no bad takes, no background noise, no stumbling over words. each

2595
05:35:46,460 --> 05:35:50,780
audio overview from the studio nails it every time. that's something you can't guarantee with

2596
05:35:50,780 --> 05:35:56,000
manual recording. even pros mess up sometimes. the studio doesn't. if you're serious about scaling

2597
05:35:56,000 --> 05:36:01,520
your business and saving hundreds of hours with AI automation like this studio design, you need

2598
05:36:01,520 --> 05:36:06,140
to check out my AI Profit Boardroom. it's the best place to learn how to get more customers

2599
05:36:06,140 --> 05:36:12,940
and automate everything with AI. we're using tools like this new Notebook LM Studio and dozens

2600
05:36:12,940 --> 05:36:18,300
of others to build real businesses, real results, no theory, just what actually works. let's

2601
05:36:18,300 --> 05:36:23,120
talk about the languages in the studio design. the studio supports a ton of them for your audio

2602
05:36:23,120 --> 05:36:28,020
overviews: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean,

2603
05:36:28,020 --> 05:36:34,420
and more keep getting added. this opens up global markets. with multiple audio overviews per

2604
05:36:34,420 --> 05:36:38,980
notebook, you're not stuck with just English anymore. you can reach people anywhere from one

2605
05:36:38,980 --> 05:36:44,460
notebook. the length customisation in the studio matters too. some people want quick summaries.

2606
05:36:44,460 --> 05:36:49,000
they're busy. they don't have time for long audio. the studio lets you give them a 3-minute

2607
05:36:49,000 --> 05:36:54,140
audio overview. other people want everything, every detail, every example. the studio lets you

2608
05:36:54,140 --> 05:37:00,340
give them a 15-minute audio overview. you serve both audiences from the same notebook with different audio overviews.

2609
05:37:00,340 --> 05:37:05,400
I've been testing the studio design with my team. we have training documents in notebooks. we

2610
05:37:05,400 --> 05:37:09,540
used to record training videos manually. that took days. now we put the documents in a notebook,

2611
05:37:09,540 --> 05:37:15,020
use the studio to generate multiple audio overviews, done in minutes. our team gets the same

2612
05:37:15,020 --> 05:37:19,800
quality training from different audio versions. we save 20 hours of work. that's 20 hours we

2613
05:37:19,800 --> 05:37:25,060
can spend on clients instead, all thanks to the studio design. here's a real use case for the

2614
05:37:25,060 --> 05:37:31,060
studio. you write a business proposal in a notebook. it's detailed, full of data. you need to

2615
05:37:31,060 --> 05:37:35,460
present it to two groups: the board of directors and the sales team. the board wants formal,

2616
05:37:35,460 --> 05:37:41,300
serious, data-focused. the sales team wants casual, energetic, action-focused. put your proposal

2617
05:37:41,300 --> 05:37:46,920
in a notebook. use the studio to make two audio overviews: one formal audio for the board, one

2618
05:37:46,920 --> 05:37:51,420
casual audio for sales. both groups get exactly what they need to hear from the same notebook.

2619
05:37:51,420 --> 05:37:58,020
the studio design also helps with accessibility through multiple audio overviews. not everyone

2620
05:37:58,020 --> 05:38:03,280
can read long documents. some people have visual impairments. some people have reading difficulties.

2621
05:38:03,280 --> 05:38:08,360
audio overviews from the studio make your notebook content accessible to everyone. and with

2622
05:38:08,360 --> 05:38:12,920
multiple languages in the studio, you're reaching people who don't speak your language. that's

2623
05:38:12,920 --> 05:38:18,120
inclusion through the studio design. the new studio interface is clean too. everything is organized.

2624
05:38:18,120 --> 05:38:22,460
you see all your audio overviews in one place. you can name them, tag them, search them. it's

2625
05:38:22,460 --> 05:38:27,360
not cluttered. it's not confusing. you know exactly what each audio overview is for. that matters

2626
05:38:27,360 --> 05:38:32,800
when you're managing multiple audio versions per notebook in the studio. and you're not sacrificing

2627
05:38:32,800 --> 05:38:38,120
quality with the studio. each audio overview sounds good: natural, professional. people won't

2628
05:38:38,120 --> 05:38:43,320
know it's AI generated unless you tell them. that means you can use these audio overviews from

2629
05:38:43,320 --> 05:38:48,520
the studio for client work, for products, for anything that needs to sound professional. the

2630
05:38:48,520 --> 05:38:54,400
best part is the studio design is live right now. you can start using multiple audio overviews

2631
05:38:54,400 --> 05:38:59,520
per notebook today. download the mobile app, open the studio, start creating. this is how you

2632
05:38:59,520 --> 05:39:04,540
get ahead while others are still doing things the old way. so here's what you do next. download

2633
05:39:04,540 --> 05:39:09,080
the notebook LM mobile app if you haven't already. create a notebook with some content you use

2634
05:39:09,080 --> 05:39:14,760
regularly. go to the new studio design. try making multiple audio overviews: different languages,

2635
05:39:14,760 --> 05:39:19,140
different lengths, different tones. see what works for your needs. experiment with the studio.

2636
05:39:19,140 --> 05:39:24,559
test different audio versions. find your workflow. then think about how you can integrate the

2637
05:39:24,559 --> 05:39:30,420
studio design into your business. where can multiple audio overviews save you time? where can

2638
05:39:30,420 --> 05:39:35,839
different languages expand your reach? where can custom tones improve your message? make a list.

2639
05:39:35,839 --> 05:39:41,100
start implementing the studio. this is how you get ahead. the people who win with AI are the

2640
05:39:41,100 --> 05:39:46,299
ones who move fast on updates like the studio design. they don't wait for perfect conditions.

2641
05:39:46,299 --> 05:39:52,239
they don't overthink it. they jump in and start using new features like multiple audio overviews

2642
05:39:52,239 --> 05:39:56,199
immediately. that's how you build an advantage. everyone else is still thinking about it. you're

2643
05:39:56,199 --> 05:40:01,719
already creating multiple audio versions in the studio. today I'm going to show you how Google's

2644
05:40:01,719 --> 05:40:07,000
notebook LM just became the most powerful free AI tool for content creators.

2645
05:40:07,000 --> 05:40:11,660
I'm talking about features that just dropped that nobody's using yet. you can turn any document

2646
05:40:11,660 --> 05:40:17,199
into professional videos, podcasts, study guides, and landing pages in minutes. this thing connects

2647
05:40:17,199 --> 05:40:21,619
to the web now. it finds sources for you automatically. and when you combine it with other free

2648
05:40:21,619 --> 05:40:25,959
tools, you get a content machine that runs on autopilot. this is going to change everything

2649
05:40:25,959 --> 05:40:27,279
about how you create content.

2650
05:40:27,279 --> 05:40:32,999
I just found a way to steal rankings from every competitor in your niche in under 10 minutes.

2651
05:40:32,999 --> 05:40:37,739
this new Google tool just got an insane update, and nobody is talking about it.

2652
05:40:37,739 --> 05:40:43,440
I'm about to show you how to turn any keyword into a full SEO strategy, plus a video that sells

2653
05:40:43,440 --> 05:40:48,100
itself. this is completely free, and it's going to change how you do content forever. watch

2654
05:40:48,100 --> 05:40:51,519
this. ok so here's what just happened.

2655
05:40:51,519 --> 05:40:56,359
Google just rolled out massive updates to notebook LM, and everyone missed the biggest part.

2656
05:40:56,359 --> 05:41:01,119
and they added video overviews, which means you can now turn your research into narrated videos

2657
05:41:01,119 --> 05:41:06,179
automatically. they upgraded the studio panel so you can save all your outputs in one place.

2658
05:41:06,179 --> 05:41:11,039
they added flashcards and quizzes, which is perfect for building FAQ schema. and here's the

2659
05:41:11,039 --> 05:41:15,479
crazy part: they connected it to Google Drive so you can pull in competitor pages and search

2660
05:41:15,479 --> 05:41:20,439
research instantly. but nobody is using this for SEO, and that's where the trick comes in.

2661
05:41:20,439 --> 05:41:26,499
I'm going to show you exactly how to use notebook LM to analyze the top 10 results for any keyword,

2662
05:41:26,499 --> 05:41:31,319
find the gaps they're all missing, and create content that ranks above them. then I'll show

2663
05:41:31,319 --> 05:41:36,439
you how to turn that same research into a video in 5 minutes. this is the fastest SEO workflow

2664
05:41:36,439 --> 05:41:43,159
I've ever used. notebook LM plus perplexity AI is insane. free notebook LM just changed everything.

2665
05:41:43,159 --> 05:41:49,679
you can now turn any document into a full podcast with real AI voices that sound 100% human.

2666
05:41:49,679 --> 05:41:54,659
and when you combine it with perplexity AI, you get a content machine that runs on autopilot.

2667
05:41:54,659 --> 05:42:00,119
this is the easiest way to create content in 2025. listen I'm about to show you something that's

2668
05:42:00,119 --> 05:42:05,159
going to blow your mind: two free AI tools that, when you combine them together, create the

2669
05:42:05,159 --> 05:42:10,299
most insane content workflow I've ever seen. first let's talk about notebook LM. this is a tool

2670
05:42:10,299 --> 05:42:15,999
from Google, and it's completely free. what it does is simple. you upload any document. could

2671
05:42:15,999 --> 05:42:21,919
be a PDF, could be a text file, could be a Google Doc, could even be a YouTube video link. and

2672
05:42:21,919 --> 05:42:26,719
notebook LM reads it. then it lets you do some crazy stuff with that content. the most insane

2673
05:42:26,719 --> 05:42:32,419
feature? the audio overview. this is where things get wild. you click one button, and notebook

2674
05:42:32,419 --> 05:42:37,939
LM turns your document into a full podcast with two AI hosts: one male voice, one female voice.

2675
05:42:37,939 --> 05:42:42,019
and they have a conversation about your content. they joke around. they ask each other questions.

2676
05:42:42,019 --> 05:42:46,339
they explain things in simple terms. it sounds so real that people think it's actual humans

2677
05:42:46,339 --> 05:42:52,559
talking. hey if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO

2678
05:42:52,559 --> 05:42:57,959
agency Goldie Agency. whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, I'm here to

2679
05:42:57,959 --> 05:43:03,419
help you get the latest AI updates. but wait, there's more. notebook LM doesn't just make podcasts.

2680
05:43:03,419 --> 05:43:09,259
it can also help you understand complex documents fast. let's say you have a 50-page report.

2681
05:43:09,259 --> 05:43:14,479
you don't have time to read all of it. you upload it to notebook LM. then you ask it questions:

2682
05:43:14,479 --> 05:43:19,199
what are the main points? what are the key takeaways? can you explain this section in simple

2683
05:43:19,199 --> 05:43:24,099
terms? and it gives you answers instantly. it's like having a personal assistant who's read

2684
05:43:24,099 --> 05:43:29,079
everything for you. you can also create study guides. you can create frequently asked questions.

2685
05:43:29,079 --> 05:43:34,319
you can create summaries. you can create briefing documents, all from one upload, all with one

2686
05:43:34,319 --> 05:43:39,159
tool, all for free. this alone is worth using. but now let me show you where the magic really

2687
05:43:39,159 --> 05:43:47,019
happens when you combine this with Perplexity AI. now if you don't know what Perplexity AI is, let me explain.

2688
05:43:47,019 --> 05:43:53,339
Perplexity is like Google, but way better. it's a search engine powered by AI. you ask it a

2689
05:43:53,339 --> 05:43:58,439
question, and instead of giving you 10 blue links, it gives you one perfect answer with sources,

2690
05:43:58,439 --> 05:44:03,659
with citations, with everything you need. the best part? it's connected to the internet in real

2691
05:44:03,659 --> 05:44:09,019
time, so it can find the newest information, the latest data, the most recent news. this is

2692
05:44:09,019 --> 05:44:13,819
huge because most AI tools are stuck in the past. they only know what happened up to their training

2693
05:44:13,819 --> 05:44:18,699
date. but Perplexity can search the web right now, today, this second, and give you the most

2694
05:44:18,699 --> 05:44:22,899
up-to-date information possible. so here's how you combine these two tools together, and this

2695
05:44:22,899 --> 05:44:27,799
is where things get really powerful. first you use Perplexity to research a topic. let's say

2696
05:44:27,799 --> 05:44:32,299
you want to create content about AI automation. you go to Perplexity, you type in "what are

2697
05:44:32,299 --> 05:44:38,939
the best AI automation tools in 2025," and Perplexity searches the entire internet. it reads

2698
05:44:38,939 --> 05:44:44,219
hundreds of articles. it finds the best information, and it gives you a clean summary with sources.

2699
05:44:44,219 --> 05:44:48,939
now here's the trick: you can tell Perplexity to write in a specific format. you can say, "write

2700
05:44:48,939 --> 05:44:53,159
this as a blog post," or you can with sources or write this as a research report or write this

2701
05:44:53,159 --> 05:44:59,039
as a step-by-step guide. and it will do exactly that in seconds, with perfect formatting, with

2702
05:44:59,039 --> 05:45:02,859
proper structure, with everything you need. now before I show you the rest of this workflow,

2703
05:45:02,859 --> 05:45:08,019
if you want to learn exactly how to use AI to scale your business and get more customers, you

2704
05:45:08,019 --> 05:45:12,759
need to check out the AI Profit Boardroom. this is my community where we share the latest AI

2705
05:45:12,759 --> 05:45:17,359
strategies that actually work, real case studies, real results. alright back to the workflow.

2706
05:45:17,359 --> 05:45:22,459
now let me tell you about some other ways you can use this. you can turn your old blog posts

2707
05:45:22,459 --> 05:45:28,019
into podcasts. if you've been blogging for years, you have tons of content sitting there. most

2708
05:45:28,019 --> 05:45:32,719
people will never read it, but they might listen to it. so take those old posts, run them through

2709
05:45:32,719 --> 05:45:37,579
notebook LM, turn them into audio. now you're repurposing content that you already created.

2710
05:45:37,579 --> 05:45:42,799
you're getting more mileage out of work you already did. you can turn books into podcasts. if

2711
05:45:42,799 --> 05:45:46,919
you've written a book, or if you have the rights to a book, you can upload chapters to notebook

2712
05:45:46,919 --> 05:45:52,299
LM, create audio summaries, create discussion episodes. this is perfect for book marketing.

2713
05:45:52,299 --> 05:45:57,539
people can listen to a summary before they buy, or they can listen to deep dives on specific

2714
05:45:57,539 --> 05:46:03,519
chapters. you can turn research into content. if you're in a technical field, you probably read

2715
05:46:03,519 --> 05:46:07,839
lots of research papers. most people don't have time for that, but you can take those papers,

2716
05:46:07,839 --> 05:46:14,559
upload them to notebook LM, create a podcast that explains the findings in simple terms. now

2717
05:46:14,559 --> 05:46:19,139
you're making complex information accessible. you're positioning yourself as an expert. you're

2718
05:46:19,139 --> 05:46:23,539
providing value to your audience. you can turn competitor content into your own insights. now

2719
05:46:23,539 --> 05:46:28,719
I'm not saying copy anyone, but you can use perplexity to research what your competitors are

2720
05:46:28,719 --> 05:46:32,659
doing. see what topics they're covering. see what's working for them. then you can create your

2721
05:46:32,659 --> 05:46:41,139
own unique take, your own perspective, your own content using the same workflow. research with

2722
05:46:41,139 --> 05:46:46,779
perplexity, create with notebook LM. now let me address something. some people might say this

2723
05:46:46,779 --> 05:46:51,619
is cheating. this is not real content creation. and to those people, I say you're wrong. you're

2724
05:46:51,619 --> 05:46:57,639
dead wrong. this is the smartest way to create content in 2025. everyone is using AI now. every

2725
05:46:57,639 --> 05:47:03,179
big creator, every big brand, every big company. if you're not using AI, you're falling behind.

2726
05:47:03,179 --> 05:47:07,699
you're wasting time. you're working harder than you need to. the goal is not to replace creativity.

2727
05:47:07,699 --> 05:47:12,399
the goal is to enhance it. the goal is to focus your time on the things that matter: strategy,

2728
05:47:12,399 --> 05:47:17,559
unique insights, personal stories, your own experiences. let me handle the research. let me

2729
05:47:17,559 --> 05:47:23,139
handle the formatting. let me handle the repetitive stuff. you focus on making it yours. you

2730
05:47:23,139 --> 05:47:27,439
focus on adding value. you focus on connecting with your audience. and here's the thing: your

2731
05:47:27,439 --> 05:47:31,759
audience doesn't care how you made the content. they care if it's valuable. they care if it

2732
05:47:31,759 --> 05:47:35,539
helps them. they care if it's entertaining. they care if it solves their problems. if you can

2733
05:47:35,539 --> 05:47:39,699
do that faster with AI, you should. if you can do that better with AI, you should. there's no

2734
05:47:39,699 --> 05:47:44,219
medal for doing things the hard way. so let me give you the exact step-by-step process. step

2735
05:47:44,219 --> 05:47:50,519
one: go to perplexity, research your topic, ask specific questions, get detailed answers. tell

2736
05:47:50,519 --> 05:47:56,019
it to format the response how you want it. step two: copy that content, go to notebook lm create

2737
05:47:56,019 --> 05:48:01,219
a new notebook, paste your content in or upload it as a file. step three: click on audio overview.

2738
05:48:01,219 --> 05:48:05,479
let it generate your podcast. this takes a few minutes. go get a coffee, come back, it's done.

2739
05:48:05,479 --> 05:48:11,139
step four: download the audio file. now you can upload it anywhere: youtube spotify your website,

2740
05:48:11,139 --> 05:48:16,399
social media, everywhere. step five: take that same content and repurpose it. create a blog

2741
05:48:16,399 --> 05:48:22,399
post, create social media posts, create email newsletters, create youtube video scripts. you're

2742
05:48:22,399 --> 05:48:27,039
getting 10 pieces of content from one research session. that's the power of this workflow. now

2743
05:48:27,039 --> 05:48:32,259
i want to talk about quality because some people think i a content is low quality, and they're

2744
05:48:32,259 --> 05:48:37,199
right if you use it wrong. if you just copy and paste without thinking, if you don't add your

2745
05:48:37,199 --> 05:48:42,259
own voice, if you don't add your own insights, then yeah, it's going to be garbage. but if you

2746
05:48:42,259 --> 05:48:46,599
use it as a starting point, if you use it as a research tool, if you use it to speed up your

2747
05:48:46,599 --> 05:48:52,059
process, then the quality is incredible. the notebook lm podcasts sound better than most real

2748
05:48:52,059 --> 05:48:56,999
podcasts. voices are clear, the pacing is good, the information is well structured. and because

2749
05:48:56,999 --> 05:49:01,519
you can customize the source material, you can make sure the content is exactly what you want.

2750
05:49:01,519 --> 05:49:08,619
you're in control. you're the director. ai is just the assistant. and with perplexity, the research

2751
05:49:08,619 --> 05:49:13,179
is better than what most people can do manually because it's searching thousands of sources.

2752
05:49:13,179 --> 05:49:17,699
it's reading hundreds of articles. it's finding the best information, and it's doing it in seconds.

2753
05:49:17,699 --> 05:49:22,939
you'd have to spend hours to do the same research manually, maybe days. this way, you get better

2754
05:49:22,939 --> 05:49:27,839
results faster. here's another pro tip: you can combine multiple sources in notebook lm you

2755
05:49:27,839 --> 05:49:33,119
don't have to use just one document. you can upload five documents, 10 documents, 20 documents,

2756
05:49:33,119 --> 05:49:38,179
and notebook lm will read all of them. it will find the connections. it will create a podcast

2757
05:49:38,179 --> 05:49:43,319
that ties everything together. this is perfect for creating comprehensive guides, or deep dive

2758
05:49:43,319 --> 05:49:47,639
episodes, or ultimate resource posts. now i want to show you one more advanced technique. you

2759
05:49:47,639 --> 05:49:53,639
can use perplexity to analyze trends. you can ask it what topics are trending in my niche right

2760
05:49:53,639 --> 05:49:57,679
now. what are people talking about on social media? what are the hot topics in the news? and

2761
05:49:57,679 --> 05:50:02,839
they will tell you. then you can create content about those trending topics using the same workflow:

2762
05:50:02,839 --> 05:50:10,079
research with perplexity, create with notebook lm and boom, you're riding the wave. you're getting

2763
05:50:10,079 --> 05:50:15,839
more views, more engagement, more growth. this is exactly what big media companies do. they

2764
05:50:15,839 --> 05:50:21,299
find trending topics, they create content fast, they publish it while people still care. and

2765
05:50:21,299 --> 05:50:24,899
now you can do the same thing. you don't need a team of writers. you don't need a team of producers.

2766
05:50:24,899 --> 05:50:29,639
you just need these two free tools and the knowledge of how to use them. let me tell you what

2767
05:50:29,639 --> 05:50:34,839
this means for the future. content creation is changing. the old way was slow, expensive, hard.

2768
05:50:34,839 --> 05:50:39,059
you had to write everything yourself. you have to record everything yourself. you have to edit

2769
05:50:39,059 --> 05:50:44,239
everything yourself. it took forever. most people gave up. but now, the barriers are gone. anyone

2770
05:50:44,239 --> 05:50:49,699
can create professional level content. anyone can compete with big brands. anyone can build

2771
05:50:49,699 --> 05:50:52,699
an audience. this is the democratization of media.

2772
05:50:52,699 --> 05:50:57,659
And if you want even more help with this, if you want to learn how to build a business around

2773
05:50:57,659 --> 05:51:02,659
AI, if you want to connect with other people doing the same thing, then you need to check out

AI community, a free AI course, and proven AI case studies.

2779
05:51:31,479 --> 05:51:37,299
Today, I'm going to show you how Gemini and notebook LM create SEO content that ranks in under an hour.

2780
05:51:37,299 --> 05:51:41,719
I'm talking about content that used to take days. now it takes minutes with these two tools

2781
05:51:41,719 --> 05:51:48,059
working together. and the crazy part: notebook LM discover finds all your research sources automatically.

2782
05:51:48,059 --> 05:51:52,199
And Gemini canvas builds entire landing pages without touching code.

2783
05:51:52,199 --> 05:51:57,339
This is how we're scaling past eight figures at my agency, and I'm going to give you the exact

2784
05:51:57,339 --> 05:51:59,859
system, every single step, every single prompt.

2785
05:51:59,859 --> 05:52:05,259
So, here's what most people get wrong about AI content. they use one tool, they paste it into

2786
05:52:05,259 --> 05:52:07,559
WordPress, and they wonder why it doesn't rank.

2787
05:52:07,559 --> 05:52:11,079
The reason is simple: they're missing the research layer. they're missing the optimization layer.

2788
05:52:11,079 --> 05:52:14,539
they're missing the proof. the system I'm about to show you fixes all of that.

2789
05:52:14,539 --> 05:52:19,459
You're going to use two tools together: notebook LM for research, Gemini for creation. and when

2790
05:52:19,459 --> 05:52:24,239
these tools work together, magic happens. you get content backed by real sources, optimized

2791
05:52:24,239 --> 05:52:27,819
for search engines, with landing pages that convert, all in one workflow.

2792
05:52:27,819 --> 05:52:34,399
Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie agency.

2793
05:52:34,399 --> 05:52:38,599
Let me walk you through the system step by step with the actual prompts you need to copy and paste.

2794
05:52:38,599 --> 05:52:41,339
Step one is choosing your topic and finding keywords.

2795
05:52:41,339 --> 05:52:43,719
You need a target before you start. don't guess.

2796
05:52:43,719 --> 05:52:48,699
Go into Gemini and paste this prompt: list 10 short tail and long tail keyword ideas for [topic].

2797
05:52:48,699 --> 05:52:53,979
and then put your topic in brackets. prioritize search intent: transactional over informational

2798
05:52:53,979 --> 05:52:56,819
over navigational. show search questions, hit enter.

2799
05:52:56,819 --> 05:53:02,259
Gemini gives you a full keyword list with search intent mapped out and questions people are actually asking.

2800
05:53:02,259 --> 05:53:05,339
Pick your main keyword, pick four supporting keywords, write them down.

2801
05:53:05,339 --> 05:53:08,959
You'll use these throughout the entire process. Now, open notebook LM.

2802
05:53:08,959 --> 05:53:13,459
This is where the magic starts. notebook LM has this feature called discover. it automatically

2803
05:53:13,459 --> 05:53:15,419
finds the best sources on any topic.

2804
05:53:15,419 --> 05:53:18,099
No more clicking through 10 pages of Google results.

2805
05:53:18,099 --> 05:53:20,219
No more reading articles that don't help.

2806
05:53:20,219 --> 05:53:21,119
Discover does the work for you.

2807
05:53:21,119 --> 05:53:25,719
Here's the exact prompt: Create a research notebook about and then put your. [topic]. focus

2808
05:53:25,719 --> 05:53:31,199
on SEO intent, target keyword and then put your primary keyword and four supporting keywords.

2809
05:53:31,199 --> 05:53:35,999
Then write your four keywords. find authoritative sources, white papers, and blog posts.

2810
05:53:35,999 --> 05:53:36,919
But you're not done yet.

2811
05:53:36,919 --> 05:53:41,339
You need to actually pull in those sources. use the discover feature and paste this prompt:

2812
05:53:41,339 --> 05:53:44,099
discover top sources for and put your [topic].

2813
05:53:44,099 --> 05:53:50,019
Return up to 10 recommended articles, PDFs, and docs with a one line summary and a trust score from 1 to 10.

2814
05:53:50,019 --> 05:53:56,139
Add the best six to this notebook. notebook LM will scan the web, Find articles, rate them,

2815
05:53:56,139 --> 05:53:57,459
and add the best ones to your notebook.

2816
05:53:57,459 --> 05:53:59,019
This happens in like two minutes.

2859
05:56:43,039 --> 05:56:44,719
You don't need an SEO expert.

2860
05:56:44,719 --> 05:56:47,639
Gemini does it all. but content needs more than text.

2861
05:56:47,639 --> 05:56:52,579
It needs visuals, social posts, thumbnails, and Gemini creates all of that.

2862
05:56:52,579 --> 05:56:57,419
Here's the prompt: generate five thumbnail headline options that are short, six social captions

2863
05:56:57,419 --> 05:57:03,219
for Twitter, six LinkedIn post captions, and a script for a 30 second video teaser. also output

need to promote across every platform: headlines for YouTube, captions for social, screenshot ideas, all done.

2866
05:57:14,519 --> 05:57:15,559

05:57:15,559 --> 05:57:20,879
Gemini canvas, this tool builds actual working websites from prompts. no code, no developers,

2868
05:57:20,879 --> 05:57:23,239
just describe what you want. canvas builds it.

2869
05:57:23,239 --> 05:57:28,179
Paste this prompt into Gemini canvas: create a responsive single page landing site for this

2870
05:57:28,179 --> 05:57:34,079

2873
05:57:46,859 --> 05:57:50,339

05:57:50,339 --> 05:57:55,159
You can see it live, edit it with more prompts, export the code, host it anywhere.

2875
05:57:55,159 --> 05:57:59,739
You just built a professional landing page in five minutes that would have cost hundreds of dollars.

2876
05:57:59,739 --> 05:58:04,879
But there's one more critical step: fact checking. you need to verify everything before you publish.

2877
05:58:04,879 --> 05:58:09,719
Go to notebook lm with this prompt: check the final article and landing page content against

2878
05:58:09,719 --> 05:58:15,499
notebook sources. flag any unsupported claims And suggest corrections. notebook lm scans your

2895
05:59:30,839 --> 05:59:36,649
show you how google just made notes turn into videos with crazy ai art. this thing is free.

2896
05:59:36,649 --> 05:59:41,929
it makes narrated slideshows from your messy docs. you get six wild art styles, and it takes

2897
05:59:41,929 --> 05:59:46,569
like one click. this is going to change how you make content forever. so google just dropped

2898
05:59:46,569 --> 05:59:51,989
this update to notebook lm, and it's honestly wild. they added something called video overviews

2899
05:59:51,989 --> 05:59:57,029
with nano banana visuals. yeah that's the real name, nano banana. i know it sounds like a fruit,

2900
05:59:57,029 --> 06:00:02,149
but it's actually google's image model that makes art from your notes. here's what happened.

2901
06:00:02,149 --> 06:00:09,509
notebook lm used to just make audio podcasts from your docs. now it makes full videos, narrated

2902
06:00:09,509 --> 06:00:15,689
videos with illustrations, with diagrams, with quotes pulled right from your source files. and

2903
06:00:15,689 --> 06:00:20,429
you don't need to be a designer. you don't need photoshop. you just upload your stuff and press

2904
06:00:20,429 --> 06:00:26,989
a button. hey if we haven't met already, i'm the digital avatar of julian goldie, ceo of seo

2907
06:00:37,969 --> 06:00:42,229

2908
06:00:42,229 --> 06:00:47,749
a google doc or even a youtube link. notebook lm reads it. then it generates a video overview.

2909
06:00:47,749 --> 06:00:56,049
that means a short slideshow with a. it's not robotic; it's actually pretty natural. now here's

2910
06:00:56,049 --> 06:01:00,969
where it gets crazy. you get six visual styles to pick from: watercolor, papercraft, anime,

2911
06:01:00,969 --> 06:01:06,109
whiteboard, retro print, and heritage. each one has a different vibe. watercolor looks soft

2912
06:01:06,109 --> 06:01:12,049
and artsy. papercraft looks like cut paper and crafts. anime is bold and colorful. whiteboard

2913
06:01:12,049 --> 06:01:17,309
is clean and simple. retro print looks like old posters. heritage looks classic and vintage.

2914
06:01:17,309 --> 06:01:22,129
you can switch styles instantly, no waiting, no rendering. you just click and boom, new art,

2915
06:01:22,129 --> 06:01:26,789
same narration, different look. this is huge because now you can match your brand or your audience

2916
06:01:26,789 --> 06:01:31,949

2917
06:01:31,949 --> 06:01:37,449
you a quick recap. it's like 30 seconds to a minute, perfect for youtube shorts or tiktoks or

2918
06:01:37,449 --> 06:01:42,649
instagram reels. explainer is longer. it's structured. it goes deep. it's like 5 to 12 minutes.

2919
06:01:42,649 --> 06:01:47,689
that's perfect for full youtube videos or training content. before i move further, let me tell

2920
06:01:47,689 --> 06:01:52,589
you about two things that are going to change your business. first is my AI profit boardroom.

2924
06:02:17,409 --> 06:02:23,589
AI case studies. both links are in the description. join now. all right, let's keep going. so

2925
06:02:23,589 --> 06:02:28,809
why does this matter? because most people hate turning notes into videos. it's boring. it takes

2926
06:02:28,809 --> 06:02:33,729
forever. you got to write a script. you got to find images. you got to record audio. you got

2927
06:02:33,729 --> 06:02:38,949
to edit. notebook lm does all of that in one shot. you upload your notes and get a finished

2928
06:02:38,949 --> 06:02:44,029
video in minutes. now let me tell you how to actually use this thing. first you open notebook

2929
06:02:44,029 --> 06:02:49,149
lm. it's free. you don't need to; you just need a google account. then you make a new notebook

2930
06:02:49,149 --> 06:02:53,929
or open one you already have. you add sources. that could be a pdf, a word doc, a google doc,

2931
06:02:53,929 --> 06:02:58,849
a web page, a youtube video, anything with text or info. once your sources are in, you hit the

2932
06:02:58,849 --> 06:03:03,929
video overview button. it's right there in the interface. then you pick your format, brief or

2933
06:03:03,929 --> 06:03:08,729
explainer. then you pick your style, one of those six nano banana styles i mentioned. then you

2934
06:03:08,729 --> 06:03:14,009
hit generate. that's it. you wait like a minute or two. you got a video. the video plays right

2935
06:03:14,009 --> 06:03:18,889
in the app. it's got narration. it's got slides. it's got visuals pulled from your sources.

2936
06:03:18,889 --> 06:03:23,929
if your pdf had a chart, it might show that chart. if your doc had a quote, it might highlight

2937
06:03:23,929 --> 06:03:28,809
that quote on screen. it's contextual. it's not random stock art. it's made from your actual

2938
06:03:28,809 --> 06:03:33,549
content. now here's where this gets insane for youtube creators. you can use the brief format

2939
06:03:33,549 --> 06:03:38,229
to pump out shorts. think about it. you got a long blog post. you throw it in notebook lm. you

2940
06:03:38,229 --> 06:03:43,969
generate a brief. you get a 30 second narrated video with cool visuals. you post it, done. you

2941
06:03:43,969 --> 06:03:48,609
just made a short in two minutes. or you use the explainer format for your main channel videos.

2942
06:03:48,609 --> 06:03:53,189
you got course notes. you got research. you got a bunch of pdfs. you throw them all in. you

2943
06:03:53,189 --> 06:03:57,629
generate an explainer. you get a five minute script with visuals. now you got a backbone for

2944
06:03:57,629 --> 06:04:02,509
your video. you can record over it. you can use the visuals as b-roll. you can even just re-record

2945
06:04:02,509 --> 06:04:07,909
the script in your own voice and use their slides and the visuals make great thumbnails. you

2946
06:04:07,909 --> 06:04:13,629
generate a video in the anime style. you screenshot one of the slides. you add some text, boom,

2947
06:04:13,629 --> 06:04:18,589
thumbnail. you didn't need canva. you didn't need a designer. notebook lm gave you the art.

2948
06:04:18,589 --> 06:04:22,789
so you pick the style that matches your vibe. that's the beauty of this. you're not locked into

2949
06:04:22,789 --> 06:04:27,649
one look. you can make the same video in six different styles and test which one performs better.

2950
06:04:27,649 --> 06:04:32,569
you can a b test your thumbnails. you can a b test your shorts. you can see what your audience

2951
06:04:32,569 --> 06:04:37,649
likes. now let me talk about how to actually export this stuff. when you generate a video overview,

2952
06:04:37,649 --> 06:04:42,729
it plays in the app. you can record your screen. you can use obs or quick time or whatever screen

2953
06:04:42,729 --> 06:04:48,109
recorder you got. you just hit record and play the video. now you got the file. or you can export

2954
06:04:48,109 --> 06:04:52,549
the frames. you can screenshot the slides. you can pull those images out and use them as b-roll.

2955
06:04:52,549 --> 06:04:57,989
you can drop them into premiere or final cut or cap cut. you can add your own voiceover. you

2956
06:04:57,989 --> 06:05:02,749
can add music. you can customize it however you want. the narration is generated by notebook

2957
06:05:02,749 --> 06:05:08,549
lm. it's ai voices. they sound like two people having a conversation. it's pretty natural. but

2958
06:05:08,549 --> 06:05:12,689
if you want to use your own voice, you just record over it. you use the script that notebook

2959
06:05:12,689 --> 06:05:17,729
lm wrote. you read it yourself. now it's your voice with their visuals. that's a killer combo.

2960
06:05:17,729 --> 06:05:23,289
now let me talk about the rollout because this isn't available everywhere right now. it's rolling

2961
06:05:23,289 --> 06:05:28,609
out on desktop first. it's in english first. google said they're expanding to more languages

2962
06:05:28,609 --> 06:05:33,249
and mobile soon. so if you're not seeing it yet, check back in a few days. it's coming. you

2963
06:05:33,249 --> 06:05:38,549
need a google account. you need to go to notebook lm. that's at notebooklm.google.com. it's

2964
06:05:38,549 --> 06:05:42,269
free. you don't need google one. you don't need to pay for anything. you just sign in and start

2965
06:05:42,269 --> 06:05:47,089
using it. now let me talk about the legal side. if you use notebook lm to make videos, make

2966
06:05:47,089 --> 06:05:51,889
sure you or have rights to the source material. don't throw in someone else's copyrighted pdf

2967
06:05:51,889 --> 06:05:56,349
and make a video from it. that's not cool. that could get you in trouble. use your own content.

2968
06:05:56,349 --> 06:06:01,889
use public domain content. use content you have permission to use. also if you're showing user

2969
06:06:01,889 --> 06:06:07,789
data or private info in your videos, blur it or anonymize it. don't show sensitive stuff. protect

2970
06:06:07,789 --> 06:06:12,569
people's privacy and check google's terms. if you plan to rehost or sell notebook lm content,

2971
06:06:12,569 --> 06:06:17,269
google might have rules about commercial use. read the terms. stay safe. all right, so here's

2972
06:06:17,269 --> 06:06:22,769
what you need to do right now. go to notebook lm. make a notebook. add some sources. generate

2990
06:07:55,809 --> 06:08:00,449
that will blow your mind. these are brand new tricks that nobody's talking about yet. i'm going

2991
06:08:00,449 --> 06:08:05,289
to show you how to use notebook lm in ways google never intended. this stuff is so powerful.

2992
06:08:05,289 --> 06:08:10,989
it's basically unfair. by the end of this video, you'll be using ai like a total pro, and the

2993
06:08:10,989 --> 06:08:15,949
best part is completely free. all right, let's talk about notebook lm. this tool is crazy. most

2994
06:08:15,949 --> 06:08:20,709
people have no idea what it can actually do. they think it's just another ai chatbot. wrong

2995
06:08:20,709 --> 06:08:26,509
notebook lm is completely different from chat gpt or claude. it's better in a lot of ways, and

2996
06:08:26,509 --> 06:08:31,469
i'm going to show you exactly why. but first, let me explain what notebook lm actually is. it's

2997
06:08:31,469 --> 06:08:37,289
a tool made by google that lets you upload your own files. then it creates an ai that knows

2998
06:08:37,289 --> 06:08:43,009
everything about those files. you can upload pdfs, documents, websites, videos, audio files,

2999
06:08:43,009 --> 06:08:47,389
pretty much anything. then you can ask it questions about all that content. now here's what

3000
06:08:47,389 --> 06:08:52,269
makes notebook lm different. when you use chat gpt, is trained on general knowledge. it knows

3001
06:08:52,269 --> 06:08:56,189
a lot about everything, but it doesn't know anything specific about your business. notebook

3002
06:08:56,189 --> 06:09:00,769
lm is the opposite. you feed it your documents, then it becomes an expert on your stuff. hey

3003
06:09:00,769 --> 06:09:07,149
if we haven't met already, i'm the digital avatar of julian goldie, ceo of seo agency goldie

3004
06:09:07,149 --> 06:09:12,009
agency. whilst he's helping clients get more leads and customers, i'm here to help you get the

3005
06:09:12,009 --> 06:09:17,149
latest ai updates. i'm going to show you the real power moves, the hacks that actually matter,

3006
06:09:17,149 --> 06:09:21,969
the stuff that will save you hours every single day. let's start with hack number one. this

3007
06:09:21,969 --> 06:09:27,829
one alone is worth the entire video. you can turn any content into a. i don't mean a regular

3008
06:09:27,829 --> 06:09:32,349
podcast. i mean a full conversation between two people. they talk about your content like they're

3009
06:09:32,349 --> 06:09:37,129
on a radio show. they ask each other questions. they explain complex ideas in simple terms.

3010
06:09:37,129 --> 06:09:41,349
it sounds completely real. here's how you do it. upload your content to notebook lm. could be

3011
06:09:41,349 --> 06:09:46,609
a blog post, a pdf, a research paper, anything. then click on the audio overview button. that's

3012
06:09:46,609 --> 06:09:52,569
it. notebook lm will create a whole podcast episode about your content. two ai hosts talking

3013
06:09:52,569 --> 06:09:57,469
about your stuff. the crazy part is how good it sounds. these aren't robot voices. they sound

3014
06:09:57,469 --> 06:10:02,129
like real people having a real conversation. and here's another way to use this. let's say you

3015
06:10:02,129 --> 06:10:08,349
write a blog post. you spend hours on it, but most people won't read it. they're too busy. so

3016
06:10:08,349 --> 06:10:15,889
turn your blog posts into a podcast. upload it to notebook lm. generate the audio. now you have

3017
06:10:15,889 --> 06:10:21,829
a. put it on spotify. suddenly your written content reaches a whole new audience. hack number

3018
06:10:21,829 --> 06:10:27,189
two is about customizing those podcasts. most people don't know you can do this. you can actually

3019
06:10:27,189 --> 06:10:32,489
tell notebook lm what to focus on. let's say you upload a long document about marketing, but

3020
06:10:32,489 --> 06:10:37,989
you only care about the seo parts. you can tell notebook lm to focus on seo. then the podcast

3021
06:10:37,989 --> 06:10:42,729
will spend most of the time talking about that. here's how. before you generate the audio, look

3022
06:10:42,729 --> 06:10:48,049
for the customize button. it's right next to the audio overview button. click that. then type

3023
06:10:48,049 --> 06:10:53,329
in what you want the host to focus on. be specific. don't just say focus on the important parts.

3024
06:10:53,329 --> 06:10:58,749
say focus on the three main seo strategies discussed in this document. the more specific you

3025
06:10:58,749 --> 06:11:03,309
are, the better the results. you can also tell it to make the podcast shorter or longer. let's

3026
06:11:03,309 --> 06:11:08,129
say the default podcast is 20 minutes, but you only have a 10 minute drive. tell it to make

3027
06:11:08,129 --> 06:11:13,309
a 10 minute version. it will condense everything, focus on the most important points. now let's

3028
06:11:13,309 --> 06:11:17,489
talk about hack number three. this one is for people who work with teams. you can use notebook

3029
06:11:17,489 --> 06:11:22,249
lm as a shared knowledge base. here's the problem. most teams have someone creates a document,

3030
06:11:22,249 --> 06:11:26,749
they share it with the team, nobody reads it. then people keep asking the same questions over

3031
06:11:26,749 --> 06:11:31,529
and over. it wastes so much time. notebook lm solves this. upload all your company documents

3032
06:11:31,529 --> 06:11:37,489
to a notebook lm project. training materials, process docs, meeting notes, everything. then

3033
06:11:37,489 --> 06:11:41,769
share that project with your team. now anyone can ask questions and get instant answers. no

3034
06:11:41,769 --> 06:11:46,629
more searching through 50 different google docs. the ai knows everything, and it cites its sources.

3035
06:11:46,629 --> 06:11:52,629
all right, before i show you the next hack, i need to tell you something important. if you want

3036
06:11:52,629 --> 06:11:59,529
to actually scale your business with ai, you need to join the ai profit boardroom. this is where

3037
06:11:59,529 --> 06:12:06,429
i share all my best ai strategies. inside you'll get access to proven ai automations and a community

3038
06:12:06,429 --> 06:12:11,249
of entrepreneurs who are actually doing this stuff, not just talking about it. link is in the

3039
06:12:11,249 --> 06:12:16,129
description. now let's keep going. hack number four is about research. this is huge. if you're

3040
06:12:16,129 --> 06:12:21,609
a student or you create content, you can upload multiple sources to notebook lm. then ask it

3041
06:12:21,609 --> 06:12:27,069
to compare them or find contradictions or synthesize them into a single argument. you can also

3042
06:12:27,069 --> 06:12:34,449
use this for fact checking. let's say you find three or four other sources on the topic. upload

3043
06:12:34,449 --> 06:12:38,769
them all to notebook lm. ask if they all agree. now you know which information is reliable.

3044
06:12:38,769 --> 06:12:43,949
hack number five is for anyone who does interviews or podcasts. you can upload audio or video

3045
06:12:43,949 --> 06:12:49,129
files to notebook lm. then it transcribes them automatically, and you can ask questions about

3046
06:12:49,129 --> 06:12:53,969
the content. this is a game changer for repurposing content. let's say you do a one hour podcast

3047
06:12:53,969 --> 06:13:00,069
interview. upload the audio to notebook lm. then ask it for the 10 quotes or the main takeaways.

3048
06:13:00,069 --> 06:13:05,769
now you have content for social media, for email newsletters, for blog posts, all from one interview.

3049
06:13:05,769 --> 06:13:10,229
but here's where it gets really powerful. you can ask notebook lm to find specific moments in

3050
06:13:10,229 --> 06:13:14,469
the video. let's say you did a two-hour interview. you vaguely remember talking about email

3051
06:13:14,469 --> 06:13:20,489
marketing, but you don't remember when. just ask notebook lm when did we talk about email marketing.

3052
06:13:20,489 --> 06:13:25,429
it will tell you the exact time stamp. hack number six is about learning new skills. you can

3053
06:13:25,429 --> 06:13:29,849
use notebook lm as a personal tutor. upload a book or course materials. then ask it to quiz

3054
06:13:29,849 --> 06:13:34,609
you or explain concepts in different ways or give you examples. here's why this works so well.

3055
06:13:34,609 --> 06:13:39,509
most people learn by reading once and hoping it sticks. that's terrible for retention. you need

3056
06:13:39,509 --> 06:13:43,809
to engage with the material. ask questions. test yourself. notebook lm makes this easy. you

3057
06:13:43,809 --> 06:13:49,129
can also ask it to explain things like you're five years old or give you analogies. the ai will

3058
06:13:49,129 --> 06:13:53,849
adapt its explanation to match what you need. if you don't understand something, just keep asking

3059
06:13:53,849 --> 06:13:59,129
questions. hack number seven is for people who hate meetings. you can record meetings and upload

3060
06:13:59,129 --> 06:14:04,949
them to notebook lm. then ask it for action items or decisions that were made or who's responsible

3061
06:14:04,949 --> 06:14:10,289
for what. no more taking notes during meetings. just record it, upload it, ask the ai. i do

3062
06:14:10,289 --> 06:14:15,089
this for every client call. now after the call, i upload the recording, ask notebook lm what

3063
06:14:15,089 --> 06:14:19,589
the client wants, what we agreed to deliver, what the timeline is. then i send that summary

3064
06:14:19,589 --> 06:14:24,149
to my team. everyone knows exactly what to do, and i didn't have to spend 30 minutes writing

3065
06:14:24,149 --> 06:14:30,729
meeting notes. you can also use this to settle arguments. let's say two people remember a meeting differently. just

3066
04:00:05,070 --> 07:45:00,520
Just ask notebook lm what actually happened. it will tell you exactly what was said. hack number

3067
07:45:00,520 --> 07:45:06,140
eight is about combining notebook lm with other ai tools. this is where things get really powerful.

3068
07:45:06,140 --> 07:45:12,320
you can use notebook lm to research a topic, then copy that research into chat gpt or claude

3069
07:45:12,320 --> 07:45:17,480
and tell them to write something. here's another combo: use notebook lm to analyze customer

3070
07:45:17,480 --> 07:45:22,860
feedback. upload all your customer reviews, all your support tickets. ask it, what are the top

3071
07:45:22,860 --> 07:45:29,700
three complaints? what do customers love most? then take that information to chat gpt tell it

3072
07:45:29,700 --> 07:45:35,540
to write product updates or marketing copy. now everything you create is based on real customer

3073
07:45:35,540 --> 07:45:41,120
data. hack number nine is about organizing your ideas. you can upload random notes and thoughts

3074
07:45:41,120 --> 07:45:46,440
to notebook lm then ask it to organize them or find patterns or turn them into an outline. this

3075
07:45:46,440 --> 07:45:50,860
is perfect for people who have a million ideas but can't organize them. i keep a notes app on

3076
07:45:50,860 --> 07:45:55,400
my phone. whenever i have an idea, i write it down. but then i have hundreds of random notes.

3077
07:45:55,400 --> 07:46:00,700
now i upload them all to notebook lm ask it to group similar ideas together or find the best

3078
07:46:00,700 --> 07:46:05,760
ideas in the list. suddenly all those random thoughts become actionable. you can also use this

3079
07:46:05,760 --> 07:46:09,980
for brainstorming. let's say you're trying to come up with content ideas. you write down 20

3080
07:46:09,980 --> 07:46:16,220
random thoughts, upload them to notebook lm ask it which ideas have the most potential or how

3081
07:46:16,220 --> 07:46:21,500
you could combine ideas to create something better. hack number 10 is the most advanced one.

3082
07:46:21,500 --> 07:46:26,420
you can use notebook lm to create standard operating procedures. this is huge for business owners.

3083
07:46:26,420 --> 07:46:30,980
if you want to stay ahead with tools like notebook lm and automate more of your business with
