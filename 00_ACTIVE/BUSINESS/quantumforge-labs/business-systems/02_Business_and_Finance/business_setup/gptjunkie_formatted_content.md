I started as a complete beginner with AI tools. I was fascinated by what they could do but frustrated by how hard they were to implement in real businesses.

So I became obsessed. I tried every AI tool I could find. I built custom solutions. I failed a lot. I learned even more.

Now I help other AI enthusiasts turn their obsession into profit. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer, I've got something for you.
