# AvatarArts · Portfolio Auto-Builder

This pack gives you:
- `python.html` — static, filterable portfolio page (drop into your site root).
- `portfolio/portfolio_descriptions.csv` — data source for the page.
- `content/alchemy_case_studies.md` — 10 case studies to paste near the top of `alchemy.md`.
- `scripts/build_portfolio.py` — scans your repo folders to regenerate CSV + MD.
- `.github/workflows/portfolio.yml` — GitHub Actions to rebuild on every push and commit results.

## How to use

1) **Copy** this pack into your repo (preserve folders).  
2) Commit and push. The action will run and populate `portfolio/` + `content/`.  
3) Host `python.html` at `avatararts.org/python.html` (ensure the `portfolio/` folder is accessible so the CSV loads).  
   - The page also has an embedded JSON fallback, but serving the CSV lets you auto-update without editing HTML.

### Manual build
```bash
python scripts/build_portfolio.py .
# Outputs:
# - portfolio/portfolio_descriptions.csv
# - content/python_portfolio.md
# - content/alchemy_index.md
```

### Add the case studies
Open `content/alchemy_case_studies.md` and paste the block at the **top** of `alchemy.md`.

Pro tip: The categorizer is heuristic-based. If you want precise mapping, edit keywords in `CATEGORIES` inside `scripts/build_portfolio.py`.
