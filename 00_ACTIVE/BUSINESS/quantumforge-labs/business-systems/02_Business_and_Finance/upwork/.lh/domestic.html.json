Got\n-it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything\n-you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed\n-to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization.\n-And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. --- The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science,\n-metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including\n-books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit\n-audiences, industries, and partners Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally\n-recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. ---\n-What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n-to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists,\n-fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking +\n-Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads 4.\n-Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends\n-or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map\n-showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending\n-fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination\n-into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion\n-and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea\n-is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would\n-you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\" Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep\n-LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

You are responsible for both the creative (scripts, editing, B-roll) and the strategic (titles, thumbnails, retention, performance). 📋 YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES: Every week, you will: Take my topic or idea\n-and write a natural, helpful, engaging script (in my voice) Use ElevenLabs and Hygen to generate a human-like AI video Add B-roll, captions, visual effects, and pattern interrupts that hold attention Create 2–3 titles and thumbnails for each video Use\n-TubeBuddy, Thumblytics, and VidIQ to split test titles and thumbnails Write the video description, tags, timestamps, and hashtags Post the video on YouTube using Metricool Post at least 2 weeks worth of videos in advance, so that we never miss a deadline\n-in the event something goes wrong. Send a short report on how the last video performed Suggest at least one way to improve the next one 🎯 YOUR REQUIRED RESULTS: Your work will be judged based on these outcomes: View retention: Do people keep watching\n-past the first 30 seconds? 3 minutes? 10 minutes? Click-through rate (CTR): Are your titles and thumbnails getting clicked? Watch time: Are your edits making people stay? Growth: Are we gaining subscribers, email leads, and eventually buyers? Speed &\n-communication: Are you turning around work fast and keeping me in the loop? If you consistently miss these targets or don’t meet deadlines, the contract will end. But if you hit or beat these results, you’ll be kept on long-term and have the chance to\n-grow with the brand. ✅ REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY: To be a good fit, you must: Have experience creating YouTube videos that got over 100,000 views (ideally over 1M) Know how to write scripts that feel real and emotional — not robotic Be able to use tools like\n-ElevenLabs, Hygen, CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci, Descript, or Runway Know how to use B-roll, captions, jump cuts, zooms, and edits to hold attention Know how to create and split test titles and thumbnails using tools like TubeBuddy and VidIQ Understand YouTube\n-SEO — tags, descriptions, and performance optimization Work fast, meet deadlines, and be great at communication Care about the results — not just the task 💼 WHEN YOU APPLY, SEND THIS: Links to 3 YouTube videos you’ve worked on A short paragraph on how\n-you’d help one of my videos go viral Your favorite tools for editing, scripting, and testing Confirm if you're available for a 2-week paid trial Confirm if you're available long-term (6–12 months+) Last but not least, see the attached video to get an\n-idea of the direction that we want to go in (Ours should be MUCH better than the examples that is being shared with you here) moreabout \"YouTube Video Creator for AI-Powered Personal Brand (Weekly, Long-Term) Hygen + Elevenlabs.io\" Skills Skip skills\n-AI-Generated VideoCaptionYouTube VideoNarrated PresentationAI Speech-to-TextDescriptVideo ProductionVideo EditingAI Video GeneratorAI Video Generation Next skills.

Attached is an .mp4 sample that shows the character design,\n-background setting, and example movement style we’re aiming for. This clip illustrates the kind of expressive motion and personality we want the avatar to convey—speaking, blinking, gesturing, and emoting naturally in response to audio.

Budget: $1,000 Only freelancers located in the United States may apply. Description: I'm looking for an experienced AI developer to help me create and integrate\n-multiple AI agents for a one-week pilot project. The goal is to demonstrate how different agents—each with a unique specialty—can work together to streamline internal audits, regulatory quality processes, and real-time data analysis. What I'm Looking\n-For: AI Agent Development Expertise: Experience with multi-agent architectures, orchestration platforms, and language models like ChatGPT or similar. Web Scraping & Data Integration: Ability to set up a lightweight scraper to collect updates (e.g. CDMO\n-news or FDA releases) and convert that into agent-usable insights. API Integration: Skill in connecting systems across agents using API calls for data exchange and decision-making. Platform Suggestion & Setup: You must recommend appropriate agent orchestration\n-platforms or frameworks (open-source or licensed) that align with this pilot. Lean Infrastructure Design: All platform subscriptions or tool costs must fit within the $1,000 total project budget, including your fee. Quick Turnaround: Delivery of a functional\n-prototype with documentation within 7 days. What I’ll Provide: Access to structured and unstructured pilot data (e.g. audit templates, CRLs, SOPs, regulatory observations) for training agent behavior. A clear outline of roles for each agent (e.g. CDMO\n-monitor, audit assistant, SOP navigator). Subject matter input during development to define agent personas and behaviors. What You’ll Do: Build a lightweight multi-agent system that includes: Daily Web Monitoring Agent – Collects and summarizes updates\n-about a designated CDMO. Audit Data Agent – Analyzes historical audit data to detect risk or generate insights. SOP Knowledge Agent – Answers questions and flags non-compliance risks based on sample SOPs. Connect the agents so they can collaborate (e.g.\n-pass knowledge, escalate concerns, trigger reports). Ensure basic UI or API integration for easy access (even a local dashboard or command line is acceptable for the pilot). Recommend a sustainable approach for long-term scaling if pilot is successful.\n-How to Apply: Share examples of past work on multi-agent or AI orchestration systems. List any platforms you’d suggest (e.g. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, etc.) and why.

Got it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused\n+            with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect\n+            Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people,\n+            industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. ---\n+            The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect\n+            those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube\n+            videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners\n+            Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary\n+            figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. --- What the\n+            Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n+            to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists,\n+            mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its\n+            time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people\n+            via social platforms, communities, or ads 4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic\n+            presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses,\n+            audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever\n+            imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout,\n+            and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured\n+            dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation\n+            --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform\n+            that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\"\n+            Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

Project Overview:\n+            I’m looking for a highly skilled and tech-savvy Virtual Assistant to build a fully automated system that creates realistic, emotionally engaging short-form videos for a digital product in the relationship and lifestyle space. The system should\n+            take text and visual prompts from a Google Sheet and automatically generate videos using tools like ElevenLabs, GPT, and an AI video generator (such as D-ID, Pika, or HeyGen — you're welcome to suggest alternatives). These videos will be used\n+            for social media marketing across TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts, with future delivery options via SMS. This is a launch-phase project with room for future expansion. You’ll build a modular system that allows additional characters,\n+            outfits, and settings to be added easily in the future. Initially, we’ll start with two character styles and 5 videos per week each. 🧩 What You'll Build A fully automated video generation workflow that: Pulls daily prompts from a Google Sheet\n+            Uses GPT to generate emotional or flirty scripts Sends scripts to ElevenLabs (or similar) for voice generation Generates short vertical videos using AI tools (you choose the best stack) Uploads to a folder or posts directly to TikTok, Reels,\n+            and Shorts Optionally sends videos via SMS using a tool like Plivo or Vonage Two master animated character models with modular options for: Clothing Setting/background Actions or gestures POV or camera framing Easy-to-follow documentation\n+            so I can maintain and update the system, including: SOPs Video walkthroughs Clear structure and naming conventions 🔧 Expanded Automation Scope (Included in Initial Build) In addition to the core video automation workflow, you will also be\n+            responsible for building the following automation features into the system: 1. Content Library Management Automation Automatically log each generated video into a Google Sheet Include metadata like version, tone, category, file link, and usage\n+            date Prevent reuse of the same media by tracking history 2. SMS Delivery System Setup Configure SMS delivery using Plivo, Vonage, or a Twilio alternative Build opt-in and opt-out logic Create inactivity nudges triggered after subscriber silence\n+            Automate message timing (e.g., morning, evening, holidays) 3. Personalized Prompt and Message Generation Integrate GPT to pull prompts from Google Sheets and generate messages Personalize tone and language using subscriber data (e.g., name,\n+            pet name, love language) Connect outputs to voice and video generation tools 4. Birthday and Holiday Triggers Pull birth dates and holidays from subscriber profiles Send pre-scheduled, themed messages or media automatically 5. Subscriber Quiz\n+            Integration Format and connect an onboarding quiz via Google Forms or Typeform Save results to Google Sheets and use data to tag subscriber preferences Feed quiz outcomes into tone customization and content logic These automation features\n+            should be documented so the system can be maintained or expanded later. 🧠 Skills Needed Automation tools (Zapier, Pipedream, Make, etc.) Prompt engineering for GPT-4 or similar AI video creation (D-ID, Pika, HeyGen, Runway, etc.) Voice generation\n+            experience (e.g., ElevenLabs) Google Sheets logic and automation Short-form content strategy Clean documentation and communication Ability to balance emotional tone with technical precision Additionally, this may lead to ongoing work as we\n+            continue to enhance and expand the service offering over time. 💡 About the Brand (High-Level) This is a digital companion product focused on emotional connection and relationship fantasy. The videos are not meant to be flashy or gimmicky\n+            — they’re designed to feel personal, immersive, and emotionally real. The tone is romantic, supportive, and engaging — not comedic or cartoonish. This project is ideal for someone who loves bringing characters to life through tech and automation,\n+            and who wants to be part of building a new kind of digital experience. 📌 To Apply Please send: Your hourly rate.

Got it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused\n-            with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect\n-            Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people,\n-            industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. ---\n-            The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect\n-            those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube\n-            videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners\n-            Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary\n-            figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. --- What the\n-            Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n-            to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists,\n-            mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its\n-            time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people\n-            via social platforms, communities, or ads 4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic\n-            presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses,\n-            audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever\n-            imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout,\n-            and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured\n-            dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation\n-            --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform\n-            that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\"\n-            Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

Time: More than 6 months, 30+ hrs/week Only freelancers located in the United States may apply. Got\n+it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything\n+you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed\n+to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization.\n+And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. --- The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science,\n+metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including\n+books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit\n+audiences, industries, and partners Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally\n+recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. ---\n+What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n+to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists,\n+fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking +\n+Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads 4.\n+Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends\n+or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map\n+showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending\n+fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination\n+into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion\n+and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea\n+is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would\n+you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\" Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep\n+LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

Got it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused\n-            with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect\n-            Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people,\n-            industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. ---\n-            The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect\n-            those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube\n-            videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners\n-            Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary\n-            figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. --- What the\n-            Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n-            to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists,\n-            mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its\n-            time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people\n-            via social platforms, communities, or ads 4. Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic\n-            presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses,\n-            audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever\n-            imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout,\n-            and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured\n-            dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation\n-            --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform\n-            that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\"\n-            Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

Send a short report on how the last video performed Suggest at least one way to improve the next one 🎯 YOUR REQUIRED RESULTS: Your work will be judged based on these outcomes: View retention:\n-            Do people keep watching past the first 30 seconds? 3 minutes? 10 minutes? Click-through rate (CTR): Are your titles and thumbnails getting clicked? Watch time: Are your edits making people stay? Growth: Are we gaining subscribers, email leads,\n-            and eventually buyers? Speed & communication: Are you turning around work fast and keeping me in the loop? If you consistently miss these targets or don’t meet deadlines, the contract will end.

This short-term, fixed-price project involves creating an interactive 3D avatar that responds\n-            to audio inputs with expressive animations and emotes—similar to a VTuber model, but without the need for video or facial tracking.

Time: More than 6 months, 30+ hrs/week Only freelancers located in the United States may apply. Got\n+it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything\n+you’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed\n+to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization.\n+And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. --- The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science,\n+metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including\n+books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit\n+audiences, industries, and partners Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally\n+recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. ---\n+What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\n+to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists,\n+fringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking +\n+Recruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads 4.\n+Automated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends\n+or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map\n+showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending\n+fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination\n+into global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion\n+and analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea\n+is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would\n+you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\" Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep\n+LearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

Got\nit — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything\nyou’ve shared: --- Project Title: Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined Pitch: Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed\nto promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization.\nAnd I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up. --- The Vision in a Nutshell This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science,\nmetaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including\nbooks, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to: Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit\naudiences, industries, and partners Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally\nrecognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries. ---\nWhat the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking): 1. Universal Idea Extractor Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.) Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing\nto extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions 2. Niche Idea Research Engine For every idea, the platform auto-generates: A full market and audience profile List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists,\nfringe scientists, etc.) Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time 3. AI-Powered Matchmaking +\nRecruitment Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads 4.\nAutomated Branding & Persona Engine Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms Recommends\nor generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity 5. Omni-Idea Dashboard Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches Timeline map\nshowing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality --- Why This Matters I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending\nfairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination\ninto global momentum. --- Who I’m Looking For A software engineer who: Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion\nand analysis Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation --- If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea\nis too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity. --- Would\nyou like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers moreabout \"Artificial intelligence\" Skills Skip skills Natural Language ProcessingPythonArtificial Neural NetworkArtificial IntelligenceData ScienceNeural NetworkDeep\nLearningMachine Learningdeeplearn.js Next skills.

What I'm Looking\nFor: AI Agent Development Expertise: Experience with multi-agent architectures, orchestration platforms, and language models like ChatGPT or similar. Web Scraping & Data Integration: Ability to set up a lightweight scraper to collect updates (e.g. CDMO\nnews or FDA releases) and convert that into agent-usable insights. API Integration: Skill in connecting systems across agents using API calls for data exchange and decision-making.
