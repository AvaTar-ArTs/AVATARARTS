**Summary Channel Snapshot**  
I make mystical / hidden-history documentaries that feel like cinematic trailers—lots of lore, zero fluff. Every second gets viewer retention tricks: fast open hooks, pattern breaks, kinetic captions, and (most important) AI-generated moving images that keep the screen alive.

**WE CAN negotiate RATE**  
We’ve already seen strong performance, and now we need a long-form video editor who lives and breathes audience retention—someone who can weave lightning-fast hooks, rhythmic pacing, pattern-breaking transitions, kinetic AI motion graphics, punchy on-screen captions, and tight sound design into a seamless narrative that keeps viewers locked in from the first frame to the final end screen.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic6e1zCfUC4&t=1s  
http://youtube.com/watch?v=fYITJW8PjRA  

**If videos do good will be full time hire**

**What You’ll Do**  
- **End-to-End Edit**  
  - Receive my narrated script + VO. WE WILL PROVIDE SCRIPT AND VOICEOVER  
  - Build a timeline that never drags—hook by 3 s, tension curve every 30–45 s, cliff-hanger payoff at the end.  
  - Master of retention  

- **AI Motion Generation**  
  - Use Runway Gen-3, Pika Labs, Veo Flow, etc. to turn prompts into looping 3–8 s clips (ancient parchment sketches, cosmic geometry, dark-fantasy murals).  
  - Pretty much able to make images like the ones on the video we can provide prompts for you to enter  
  - Seamlessly chain multiple clips—no jarring jumps.  

- **Polish & Deliver**  
  - Captions with stroke/drop shadow, zooms, whip-pans, glitch cuts.  
  - Music + SFX mixed for-TV loudness (−14 LUFS ish).  
  - Output: 1920×1080 (YouTube) + 1080×1920 teaser (TikTok), 30 fps.  
  - One revision within 48 h.  

**Comp & Volume**  
- $5 per finished minute. Typical video = 7–20 min → $35–$100 each.  
- 1 video per week to start; scale up if retention metrics rock.  

**Must-Have Skills**  
- Proven high viewer-retention editing (show analytics if you can—avg % viewed, CTR, etc.).  
- Hands-on with AI motion tools (Runway, Pika, Veo, Diffusion models).  
- Premiere / Resolve + After Effects (or Fusion) mastery.  
- English good enough to catch nuance in occult / philosophical content.  

**Nice-to-Haves**

- Thumbnail design in parchment-sketch style (bold white text on black brushstroke).  
- SEO know-how for YouTube chapters, keywords, end screens.

*Got it — here's the expanded and clarified pitch for your AI platform, written for Upwork software engineers, infused with your full visionary intent and technically explained — now using the correct persona spelling: Marilyn Rowe, and drawing from everything you’ve shared:*

**Project Title:** Build a Superintelligent AI Platform to Research, Promote & Connect Every Sci-Fi, Fantasy & Futurist Idea Ever Imagined

**Pitch:**  
Hi, I’m building a revolutionary AI platform for my visionary startup — a platform designed to promote my most imaginative, world-shifting ideas and connect them with the exact people, industries, and communities who want to bring the impossible to life. This isn’t just an app — it’s the nervous system for a new kind of creative civilization. And I need a talented software engineer to help build it from the ground up.

**The Vision in a Nutshell**  
This system will automatically extract, research, and match every idea ever imagined in sci-fi, fantasy, futurism, worldbuilding, alternative science, metaphysics, UFOlogy, speculative tech, and more — and connect those ideas to investors, deep tech labs, niche audiences, remote viewers, fringe scientists, startup collaborators, and like-minded visionaries worldwide. It will scan global content — including books, films, games, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, academic papers, and even obscure or fringe sources — and use AI and NLP to:  
- Extract and categorize unique concepts, tropes, and innovations  
- Run deep niche research on each idea to locate its best-fit audiences, industries, and partners  
- Build automated outreach pipelines to promote those ideas directly to relevant communities  

*This platform will also automate the branding and visibility of my own personal persona and startup — helping me become a globally recognized visionary figure. Think of it as a Creative Superintelligence that promotes both my ideas and my identity — like a Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa hybrid, designed to capture attention across sci-fi, pop culture, and futurist industries.*

**What the Software Will Do (Technically Speaking):**  
1. **Universal Idea Extractor**  
   - Scrapes and ingests content from massive media sources (fiction databases, videos, forums, books, AI-generated archives, etc.)  
   - Uses NLP, computer vision, and semantic indexing to extract sci-fi/fantasy/futurist concepts, technologies, themes, and inventions  

2. **Niche Idea Research Engine**  
   - For every idea, the platform auto-generates:  
     - A full market and audience profile  
     - List of communities (sci-fi fans, technologists, mystics, UFOlogists, fringe scientists, etc.)  
     - Matching labs, forums, research groups, funders, and influencers  
   - Researches who in the world might care about making that idea real — even if it’s extreme, speculative, or decades ahead of its time  

3. **AI-Powered Matchmaking + Recruitment**  
   - Finds engineers, researchers, funders, creatives, remote viewers, and collaborators open to wild or unexplored visions  
   - Creates auto-personalized messages and content to reach out to these people via social platforms, communities, or ads  

4. **Automated Branding & Persona Engine**  
   - Builds and evolves my public persona — stylized as Marilyn Rowe meets Necrotessa — combining timeless elegance with metaphysical sci-fi allure  
   - Manages my aesthetic presence, voice, and exposure across platforms  
   - Recommends or generates visual/branding content aligned with my visionary identity  

5. **Omni-Idea Dashboard**  
   - Command center where I track idea traction, new markets, viral potential, community responses, audience demographics, and collaborator matches  
   - Timeline map showing how each idea is spreading — from fiction to reality  

**Why This Matters**  
I’m not just building a product. I’m building a platform that lets every visionary idea I’ve ever imagined — from artificial gods and simulated universes to time-bending fairies and self-replicating AI economies — find its people, its audience, its lab, its reality. This platform is a superintelligent publicist, matchmaker, R&D scout, and movement builder — all in one. It doesn’t just promote ideas. It turns imagination into global momentum.

**Who I’m Looking For**  
A software engineer who:  
- Can work with AI/ML/NLP, scraping, and large data pipelines  
- Can build structured dashboards and match/recommendation engines  
- Understands the tech stack needed to scale content ingestion and analysis  
- Loves both the logic of tech and the thrill of bold, sci-fi ideas  
- Believes imagination is a tool of innovation, not a limitation  

*If you’ve ever wanted to build the infrastructure for a creative singularity... if you believe that no idea is too far-fetched, and that AI can be the bridge between fiction and future — then I want to work with you. Let’s build a platform that knows how to promote genius, brand iconoclasts, and turn infinite imagination into infinite opportunity.*

*Would you like versions of this pitch for: NLP/AI specialists Full-stack devs UI/UX designers*

**YouTube Video Creator for AI-Powered Personal Brand (Weekly, Long-Term) Hygen + Elevenlabs.io**  
- **Fixed-price:** Entry level  
- **Est. Budget:** $200  
- **Location:** United States only  

**ABOUT THIS ROLE:**  
You will help me create weekly YouTube videos using AI tools and smart editing. This isn’t just a job — it’s a mission. We’re building a channel that reaches millions of people, gets millions of views, and leads to millions of buyers. Your job is to help turn my voice, my ideas, and my stories into high-performing content.

**YOUR ROLE:**  
You are the Creative Producer behind my AI-powered video brand. You turn my weekly topic into a finished video that performs like it was made by a full production team — but built smarter with AI. You are responsible for both the creative (scripts, editing, B-roll) and the strategic (titles, thumbnails, retention, performance).

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:**  
Every week, you will:  
- Take my topic or idea and write a natural, helpful, engaging script (in my voice)  
- Use ElevenLabs and Hygen to generate a human-like AI video  
- Add B-roll, captions, visual effects, and pattern interrupts that hold attention  
- Create 2–3 titles and thumbnails for each video  
- Use TubeBuddy, Thumblytics, and VidIQ to split test titles and thumbnails  
- Write the video description, tags, timestamps, and hashtags  
- Post the video on YouTube using Metricool  
- Post at least 2 weeks worth of videos in advance, so that we never miss a deadline in the event something goes wrong.  
- Send a short report on how the last video performed  
- Suggest at least one way to improve the next one  

**YOUR REQUIRED RESULTS:**  
Your work will be judged based on these outcomes:  
- View retention: Do people keep watching past the first 30 seconds? 3 minutes? 10 minutes?  
- Click-through rate (CTR): Are your titles and thumbnails getting clicked?  
- Watch time: Are your edits making people stay?  
- Growth: Are we gaining subscribers, email leads, and eventually buyers?  
- Speed & communication: Are you turning around work fast and keeping me in the loop?  

*If you consistently miss these targets or don’t meet deadlines, the contract will end. But if you hit or beat these results, you’ll be kept on long-term and have the chance to grow with the brand.*

**REQUIREMENTS TO APPLY:**  
To be a good fit, you must:  
- Have experience creating YouTube videos that got over 100,000 views (ideally over 1M)  
- Know how to write scripts that feel real and emotional — not robotic  
- Be able to use tools like ElevenLabs, Hygen, CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci, Descript, or Runway  
- Know how to use B-roll, captions, jump cuts, zooms, and edits to hold attention  
- Know how to create and split test titles and thumbnails using tools like TubeBuddy and VidIQ  
- Understand YouTube SEO — tags, descriptions, and performance optimization  
- Work fast, meet deadlines, and be great at communication  
- Care about the results — not just the task  

**WHEN YOU APPLY, SEND THIS:**  
- Links to 3 YouTube videos you’ve worked on  
- A short paragraph on how you’d help one of my videos go viral  
- Your favorite tools for editing, scripting, and testing  
- Confirm if you're available for a 2-week paid trial  
- Confirm if you're available long-term (6–12 months+)  

*Last but not least, see the attached video to get an idea of the direction that we want to go in (Ours should be MUCH better than the examples that is being shared with you here)*

AI-Generated Video, Caption, YouTube Video, Narrated Presentation, AI Speech-to-Text, Descript, Video Production, Video Editing, AI Video Generator, AI Video Generation

- **Location:** United States only  

*Calling all AI avatar enthusiasts! Our client is seeking an engineer or technical artist with experience building AI-powered 3D avatars. This short-term, fixed-price project involves creating an interactive 3D avatar that responds to audio inputs with expressive animations and emotes—similar to a VTuber model, but without the need for video or facial tracking. The avatar will be based on an existing character design (samples attached) and superimposed onto a static or lightly animated background setting. The final product should enable the character to move, speak, and emote over the background layer, delivering a responsive persona triggered by audio cues. Attached is an .mp4 sample that shows the character design, background setting, and example movement style we’re aiming for. This clip illustrates the kind of expressive motion and personality we want the avatar to convey—speaking, blinking, gesturing, and emoting naturally in response to audio. The sample video is the ideal final product.*
