happens to be tick-tock it's true in fact according to many different articles and studies the nature of the short bite-sized content on tik-tok makes it a real challenge for creators to capture their audience's attention any longer than 20 seconds in fact a couple weeks ago i set up a poll where i asked over 200 individual tick tock users at which point when they're watching a\r\n(00:27) video do they make the conscious decision to keep watching that content or to keep scrolling right on by and the general consensus was anywhere between one to four seconds now tick tock for you page videos do autoplay so at least you've got that going for you there's not the barrier of having to first click play on a video like on youtube for instance but in general those very first frames what you say in the beginning of the video the first text bubbles that people see do often contribute to the overall video\r\n(00:53) success so in light of that today we'll be discussing the most effective video hooks to grab viewers by the eyeballs and pique their interest if you find value from this video please be sure to like it down below and without further ado let's talk tik tok now the goal with each one of these six different video hooks as we'll talk about in just a second is to create what's known as a pattern interrupt because your video that's on the for you page most likely is going to be the 21st the 42nd the 81st video that\r\n(01:22) people see and so you need some way to not only stand out but interrupt that constant scrolling pattern of users so here are six highly effective ways that you can do this number one is to introduce a problem and promise a solution now this style of video hook works really well for content that is fact-based educational or maybe helpful in nature the basic equation that you're plugging and playing into here is here is a solution for this problem that people face the solution and the problem so here are two examples of these video hooks in\r\n(01:53) action hack in 15 seconds if you have invisalign or plastic retainers you might have little sharp pieces that bother you what if i told you four simple hacks to increase your productivity number one momentum is key the second style of video hooks and one of my personal favorite that i make use of often is first person narration now first person narration is where you immediately immerse your viewers into whatever story you're telling or whatever information that you're conveying and honestly it doesn't even\r\n(02:20) have to be in first person either before your viewers even have a chance to digest what the context of the video is you're already moving things forward now a lot of people choose to do this verbally when they're narrating maybe with the voiceover feature on tiktok but you can also do this visually as well for example one great content creator on tick tock you need to check out is joe paris and one of his videos that did really really well was him narrating his life story with cards that he would just flip\r\n(02:45) through and the very very first couple frames of the video were showcasing these cards which really piqued interest i would do this a lot with my own content as well using the voiceover feature the very first visuals that people saw were the text bubbles that were helping the story progress or using the voiceover feature on tiktok the story was already underway when people saw my video on the for you page and it was very effective video hook number three is a direct audience call out now there's two different ways you can\r\n(03:11) implement a direct audience call out number one is your attempt to capture the attention of your demographic usually through an exclamation stop scrolling wait don't go anywhere i want to share something with you as two examples or number two the second version of a direct audience call out is to mention something very very specific about your demographic the audience that you want to reach such as their age or a problem of theirs or an interest for example are you an 18 year old looking to make a hundred and ten\r\n(03:37) dollars this weekend there's a couple of reasons why this is highly effective in capturing detention because if you think about it you're either going to get one of two responses number one you're going to call out your target demographic for example 18 year olds and there's going to be that connection by relevance hey i'm 18 years old i want to watch this video where number two people who aren't 18 years old are going to be watching this video and wondering hey what's in this for 18 year olds that's\r\n(03:59) not applicable to me peaking their interest let me find out why and then watching the content as well are you in your 30s and looking to start your healing journey is another great video hook using this direct callout method that one of my tic toc coaching students has used not just in one video but repeating this over and over again so the direct callout method works really really effectively you can either use some sort of exclamation to capture attention or you can actually get very specific as far as the interest\r\n(04:24) age or relevance goes with your target audience and so here's two quick examples using both of these aspects of the direct callout method quick come here you gotta see this make money by copying this message is only for people who are going through a breakup right now so if that is not you you can continue to scroll video hook number four is a question or scenario proposition for example using the question idea have you ever wondered about this or maybe using the scenario proposition we've created this experiment and we\r\n(04:53) have access to this this and this here's what's going to happen you're setting the stage right now this works really really well because the focus and the overall trajectory of the video where it's going is very clear right from the beginning you know it's going to be the subject matter if you're asking a question you know what's going to be taught if you're creating some sort of scenario you know what the discussion of the video is going to be around the stage has already been said and so\r\n(05:15) it's very easy to stay in tune with the entire flow of the video and so here's two examples of using a question and a scenario proposition can you see the shadow of the earth yes right around sunset here's what will happen if you dig a hole through the earth and jump in okay video hook number five is quick motion i wish i came up with a better title for this point but fast or swift motion either done with your filming device whip panning or maybe you or something flying into frame really quickly can really be an effective eye catcher\r\n(05:48) especially when people are just mindlessly scrolling through the for you page if you can place it at the first couple frames of your video it can really stand out i would actually do this in several videos myself just kind of as an experiment where instead of the camera whip panning into frame which is what a lot of people do with a lot of trend transitions on tiktok i myself actually ran into frame really quickly and just kind of flipped my hat around as an added element of uniqueness another alternative to using your phone\r\n(06:13) or yourself or something in frame is to actually use the features that tiktok gives you for quick motion such as text bubbles having those appear and then disappear really quickly especially if they're following one another can really capture people's attention kind of like we talked about in a previous video on this channel when we reference pause games which is a huge trend on tick tock it's one of those viral video structures where you encourage people to pause the video right when a text bubble is about to\r\n(06:37) reveal another text bubble right underneath it for just a split second so it's kind of the same idea and it's a way of capitalizing on quick motion with text bubbles one other thing that i want to add before we move on to the final video hook is the idea that true masters of tick tock are going to keep the motion going throughout the video for example this is one of the reasons why mask cut transitions are some of the most viral videos on tik tok at least in this past year it's just non-stop movement\r\n(07:03) and it not only captures focus but holds it well into the video as well because all of that motion all of those cuts is just so enthralling it's hard to just scroll right on by video hook number six is an unusual element also known as an oddity now this one's really simple it may sound a bit cliche to say put something interesting in your videos but it works really really well for example justin flom the magician on tiktok is a great example he always has some weird trinket or object within the first few frames of\r\n(07:30) his video making it very enticing to new viewers and he's got several videos over several million views just because of that the second thing that you can do is it doesn't have to be visual it can also be verbal as well you're describing something in a weird way you're creating a metaphor or maybe conveying an analogy that is atypical for example one of my tic toc coaching students talked about how the journey of life is a little bit like the tick tock algorithm and that video did really well because of those parallels so for\r\n(07:57) illustration purposes here are yet a few more examples of people using an oddity in their content this is a whole side of sam and we're taking it to the next level i stole the package from my doorstep and it made me realize someone needs to take a stand against dishonest punks like this now i do want to add too and i probably should have mentioned this earlier that a key tip with video hooks is to not overthink the video structure and make the hook too removed from your content it's great to make an effort in capturing attention\r\n(08:23) but trying too hard and making that hook just too complicated may actually turn people off it's also up to you to decide whether or not you want to use one video hook in every single one of your videos maybe vary it based on the video type or just start fresh each time in fact i would encourage you to experiment with all six of these hooks just to figure out which one really is the best package for your content style there's certainly no right or wrong video hook there's creators as we've talked about\r\n(08:46) that have had success with each one of these but in general if your content is not performing as expected you know the beginning of the video might be a very good place to start looking into so that pretty much concludes this video i sincerely hope it was helpful i did put an awful lot of research into compiling everything for this content these of course are all original ideas so if you

press play on your next Instagram reel or your next Tick Tock video or your next YouTube short wait there's a lot that goes into making a video like that today I'm going to show you the specific scripting techniques that I use for myself and for my clients on how to shoot videos and how to make the video process way easier and also get more views with less amount of work we're going to look at the different ways of scripting what not to do and also if you should use tools like chat apt to write your scripts because\r\n(00:29) apparently you use chat GPT for doing everything right yeah boy and if you stay until the end of this video I'm going to give you a resource that I give my clients on how to actually make the best scripts available in the least amount of time so what are the different ways of actually writing a video script well in my opinion there are two ways to script the video one is word for word script which you would use with a teleprompter or something like that and the second one is using bullet points me personally I use bullet points or bullet\r\n(00:56) scripts but I do think there's also a place where people should actually script word for world so let's look at word for word scripting first when should you use word for word scripting so the person that's going to use word for word scripting is probably someone who doesn't have so much experience talking on camera who's very unsure about themselves who don't know what to say and how to say it so for those it's actually a very nice way of actually being able to deliver a good video also\r\n(01:20) if you have a teleprompter by the way I'm not using a teleprompter but if you have a teleprompter you can actually read your word for word script and nobody will notice and maybe that makes you even better on camera the downside is that it will make you probably sound more robotic if you don't use the right techniques to script your video we're writing differently than we actually speak so I always see people you know writing perfect scripts for a written version but that's not how we actually\r\n(01:46) speak so you know that's gonna sound like someone reading from a book or from a novel or something like that boring and the second problem with word for word scripting is that it's gonna use a boatload of time right you're going to spend a lot of time writing the script rewriting it changing every little mistake being like ah this is not grammatically correct and this is going to take you a lot a lot of time and effort so a great way to script faster and better is actually to use Google voice type whether you're scripting word\r\n(02:13) for word or bullet points doesn't matter the cool thing about using the Google voice type feature is that you actually script the way you talk and that's super important because you're not gonna use these however in the furthermore and distance of that you know these fancy words you're gonna just use your natural speech patterns as a matter of fact I bullet point scripted this video using Google Voice Type and it took me no longer than 20 minutes to write that script and that's for long form YouTube\r\n(02:40) video so now let's talk about bullet point script bullet point scripting is either just writing down a couple you know keywords or something like that or just having a loose structure where you just have some sentences and then you improvise off of these sentences with bullet point scripting sometimes you want to script a little bit more of the sentence and sometimes you actually don't need to script that much so just so you can see this is the script of the video that I'm using right now sometimes\r\n(03:05) I really go word for word what I've written down because I do think it's a good sentence and sometimes I just improvise off of that and you can also see that a lot of sentences that I actually speak here are not in the script this is because I like to flow very naturally in the conversation and remember this is all typed with the Google Docs voice function so don't forget that the really cool thing about bullet point scripting is that it takes very little time right you don't have to be perfect you just need to find a lot\r\n(03:30) of information you can even copy paste some stuff from chat GPT or something just so you have the information the how facts if you want and then just improvise from there and the second cool thing is that it makes you flow very natural you can focus on your intonations you can focus on really saying it from your heart and saying it in your speech patterns instead of just focusing on the lines on the screen you're good at that make it look so easy but whether you bullet point or your script word for word and my opinion it's\r\n(04:01) always good to script a couple hooks word for word because just to reiterate how important it is the hook is what's stopping the scroll what builds Intrigue and what makes people want to watch the whole video that you present basically you have two seconds to tell them what they're gonna learn and why they should watch this video so what I always do is script out 2 to 10 hooks per video and I almost always script them out word for word or like 90 word for word the same goes for a CTA if you have a call to\r\n(04:28) action in your video you probably want to script that as good as you can so that you actually say the right words and that you actually really have a nice flow to your CTA because that's very important for a video that people actually do what you want them to do a quick tip for the CTA make it very specific to the situation don't make it like hey if you want to know more about short form video content click on this link make it more like if you want my best 100 video hooks then send me an email with the title Hooks and you'll\r\n(04:53) get my 100 best video hooks so that you get more views and more clients through short form video and as an actual CTA if you want more video hooks send me an email with the title hooks now the last question should you use chat TPT to write your script and the answer to that question is I would never use chatgpt to write a word for word script because it just writes like a five-year-old and it writes super over the top marketing hey if you want the best video available here is how you should do that this is so awesome this is so amazing but I do\r\n(05:23) think it's a very good tool to actually put in some hard facts to actually get a lot of content what you want to say and then bullet point scripted basically and say the information in your own words so you could ask chat hey what are different ways of actually scripting a video then you'll have a bit of block of text and then you can pick and choose what kind of information you want to give into this video and it gives you more ideas of content that you could actually make and where chatgpt is also\r\n(05:47) very useful is to actually write video hooks if you tell chat GPT hey you're an expert marketer and copyrighter write me 10 Vivid emotionally appealing video hooks for a video with the topic of topic they get you pretty decent hooks I wouldn't use all 10 but you can probably use two or three of them they're pretty good sometimes so if you're stuck until this point in this video I'm going to give you a very cool free resource I recently shot a video where I walked through step by step of how I actually\r\n(06:14) break down scripting a video this is just me you know where the loom sessions much less entertaining than this video but it's very technical and it's very detail oriented this training is normally just available for my clients but I'm gonna give it to you for free all you have to do is just send me an email with the title free scripting training or contact me in my free Facebook group and ask for the free scripting training so now you know how to script a good short form video but that won't actually help you if you\r\n(06:40) don't know what the Right video structure is for short form to learn the Right video structure for short form content check out this video\r\n","title":"How To

It tells the story of Sammy, a musician whose world is shattered when a rival, symbolized by the howling cat, steals his spotlight and audience, leading to a downward spiral in his music and emotions. The lyrics depict the painful journey of Sammy as he navigates through the betrayal and turns his love and passion into a sense of resentment and anger.\n\n2. **Emotional Tone**: The emotional tone of the song is melancholic, somber, and reflective. It conveys a sense of deep sadness, disillusionment, and bitterness as Sammy's once joyful music is tainted by heartbreak and betrayal. There is a sense of longing for the past innocence and happiness, now replaced by a darker and more intense emotional landscape.\n\n3. **Intent of the Artist**: The artist seems to aim at exploring the complexities of human emotions when faced with betrayal and loss. By using vivid imagery of the alley, raccoon band, howling cat, and moonlit nights, the artist creates a metaphorical narrative that delves into the internal struggle of an individual dealing with a broken heart and shattered dreams.\n\n4. **Significant Metaphors, Symbols, or Imagery**: The raccoon band, alley lights, howling cat, and moonlit alley serve as powerful symbols in the song. The raccoon band represents the disrupted harmony in Sammy's life, the alley lights symbolize the fading hope and warmth, while the howling cat embodies betrayal and competition. The moonlit alley acts as a witness to Sammy's transformation, reflecting the passage of time and memories.\n\n5. **Overall Emotional and Narrative Experience**: The song takes the listener on a poignant journey through Sammy's emotional turmoil, from the initial shock of betrayal to the eventual transformation of his music and soul. The repetition of certain lines emphasizes the cyclical nature of pain and resentment, mirroring Sammy's internal struggle. The haunting melody and repetitive chorus contribute to the haunting and reflective atmosphere, leaving a lasting impact on the listener. Ultimately, the song captures the universal themes of loss, resilience, and the transformative power of emotions.","title":"Bite-in-the-Night_analysis.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"601cb28d-8ae1-4e98-b96d-6ba594ba31e8","request_id":"8dd544a759f7137d-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"601cb28d-8ae1-4e98-b96d-6ba594ba31e8","children":["d5614808-d7be-48da-9b0f-ec05243989c1"]},"d5614808-d7be-48da-9b0f-ec05243989c1":{"id":"d5614808-d7be-48da-9b0f-ec05243989c1","message":{"id":"d5614808-d7be-48da-9b0f-ec05243989c1","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1730730291.678669,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-Zl3uijH34YX6RTs54NMenRCr","domain":"Bite-in-the-Night_transcript.txt","text":"00:00 -- 00:22:  With raccoon band and alley lights, love ballads soft in the dark, til one night love left a mark.\n00:22 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone, Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues.\n00:39 -- 00:56:  Oh Sammy why, oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky?

**Central Themes and Meaning**:\nThe central themes of the song revolve around loss, nostalgia, loneliness, and the passage of time. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a desolate alley where the ghosts of past memories linger, and the music of a haunting melody fills the air. The alley serves as a metaphor for a place of forgotten dreams and unfulfilled potential, where the shadows of the past continue to cast a melancholic veil over the present. The repetition of phrases like \"blues in the alley,\" \"echoes fade,\" and \"haunted strings softly cry\" reinforces the sense of haunting sorrow that permeates the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Emotional Tone**:\nThe emotional tone of the song is deeply melancholic, somber, and reflective. The imagery of lost romance, broken sorrows, and empty secret places evokes feelings of longing, sadness, and unresolved grief. The haunting tune and the worn-out guitar strings create a sense of wistfulness and nostalgia, while the references to loneliness and heartbeats lost convey a profound sense of emotional isolation.\n\n3. **Intent of the Artist**:\nThe artist's intent appears to be to evoke a sense of emotional resonance in the listener by immersing them in a world of quiet desperation and unspoken regrets. Through the use of evocative imagery and poetic language, the artist invites the audience to reflect on their own experiences of loss and longing, while also capturing the bittersweet beauty of memories that have faded with time.\n\n4. **Significant Metaphors, Symbols, and Imagery**:\n- The alley symbolizes a liminal space between the past and the present, where memories and regrets coexist.\n- The haunted strings of the guitar represent the lingering echoes of past emotions and experiences.\n- The nocturnal setting and references to the dying moon suggest a sense of finality and closure.\n- The footsteps of unseen faces and the empty secret places allude to the hidden depths of the human heart and the unspoken stories that dwell within.\n\n5. **Overall Emotional and Narrative Experience**:\nThe song creates a poignant and immersive narrative experience that transports the listener to a world of forgotten dreams and unspoken longings. The repetition of themes and phrases throughout the lyrics reinforces the cyclical nature of memory and the enduring power of grief. The emotional journey of the song is one of introspection and contemplation, inviting the listener to dwell on the complexities of loss and the fleeting nature of time. The haunting melody and evocative imagery come together to create a hauntingly beautiful ode to the fragility of human emotions and the enduring power of music to capture the essence of our shared humanity.","title":"Blues_in_the_Alley_Haunted_Strings_Nocturnal_Notes_analysis.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"9befffb2-2b77-476a-bd68-bdf1a1a12bf6","request_id":"8dd544a759f7137d-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9befffb2-2b77-476a-bd68-bdf1a1a12bf6","children":["5d0ef15e-11bb-4200-a21d-3b370bb86922"]},"5d0ef15e-11bb-4200-a21d-3b370bb86922":{"id":"5d0ef15e-11bb-4200-a21d-3b370bb86922","message":{"id":"5d0ef15e-11bb-4200-a21d-3b370bb86922","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1730730291.678966,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-8tvgP6Xw5u4MKKoRmj90tHoJ","domain":"Blues_in_the_Alley_Haunted_Strings_Nocturnal_Notes_analysis1.txt","text":"Main Themes:\n- Lost romance\n- Haunting memories\n- Loneliness\n- Melancholy\n- Nostalgia\n- Unseen faces and secret places\n- Heartbreak and sorrow\n- Time standing still\n\nEmotions:\n- Sadness\n- Longing\n- Regret\n- Solitude\n- Mystery\n- Melancholy\n- Yearning\n\nKeywords:\n- Alley\n- Shadows\n- Lost romance\n- Haunted tune\n- Old guitar\n- Midnight wind\n- Hollow dreams\n- Blues\n- Echoes\n- Nocturnal notes\n- City sigh\n- Melody\n- Broken sorrows\n- Loneliness\n- Heartbeats\n- Bitter pill\n- Stars\n-","title":"Blues_in_the_Alley_Haunted_Strings_Nocturnal_Notes_analysis1.txt","tether_id":null},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"command":"context_stuff","is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":false,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"d168619b-84ab-4c14-9d3a-d83c96391cff","request_id":"8dd544a759f7137d-ATL","timestamp_":"absolute"},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d168619b-84ab-4c14-9d3a-d83c96391cff","children":["98ce3c11-cea3-408d-a5a0-bf497c53e46f"]},"98ce3c11-cea3-408d-a5a0-bf497c53e46f":{"id":"98ce3c11-cea3-408d-a5a0-bf497c53e46f","message":{"id":"98ce3c11-cea3-408d-a5a0-bf497c53e46f","author":{"role":"tool","name":"myfiles_browser","metadata":{}},"create_time":1730730291.679051,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"tether_quote","url":"file-zv9M7WPmuD41ankuRT6jFoH8","domain":"Blues_in_the_Moonlit_Nights_analysis1.txt","text":"Main themes:\n1.
