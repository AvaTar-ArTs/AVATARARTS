<p>Compelling Narrative Logic for Image Series
Overview:</p>
<p>A structured series of images that capture the essence of a dark narrative, focusing on powerful visuals, symbolic typography, and a deep, immersive story. Each image embodies detailed descriptive prompts that align with the overarching theme. Fonts, styles, and image compositions will be chosen to complement the emotional weight of each moment.
Each image's typography will reflect its core theme. The font styles should vary based on the tone of the image—bold and shattered fonts for images of societal breakdown, clean and sleek fonts for futuristic surveillance, and dramatic serif fonts for institutional destruction. Each typeface and style must be embedded within the scene, enhancing the symbolism without overpowering the visual storytelling
