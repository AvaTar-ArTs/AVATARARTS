Absolutely. Backlink signals are one of the most important off-page SEO factors. They act as "votes of confidence" from other websites — when a high-quality domain links to your product page, Google sees it as a sign that your content is valuable, trustworthy, and worth ranking higher.

What Are Backlink Signals?
ElementMeaningReferring DomainThe site linking to your product (e.g., geekcultureblog.com)Domain Authority (DA)A score (1–100) predicting how well the referring site ranksAnchor TextThe clickable words used in the link (e.g., "funny AI art mug")Link TypeDo-follow (passes authority) vs No-follow (doesn’t pass SEO juice)ContextWhere the link lives — blog post, roundup, tweet, etc.RelevanceHow aligned the linking site's niche is to your product topic

Why They Matter for You
For your Etsy/Redbubble/TikTok Shop ecosystem:


Backlinks from niche blogs (like “Anime Gift Guides” or “AI Merch Roundups”) can push your listings up in Google Images and Etsy search.


Do-follow links from high-DA sites pass ranking power and are SEO gold.


Diverse anchor text (e.g., "techwear hoodie", "vaporwave fashion", "funny gaming mug") helps you rank for multiple keywords.


Contextual mentions (e.g., product used in a YouTube demo or mentioned in a listicle) drive real engagement and traffic.

How to Get These Backlinks


Pitch your products to gift guide bloggers, anime TikTokers, or subreddit mods (with your image + description + link)


Create embeddable mockups or infographics (infographic backlinks are still gold)


Publish “How I made this” blog posts or Medium articles, then cross-link


Use HARO (Help a Reporter Out) to offer expert insight + get linked
