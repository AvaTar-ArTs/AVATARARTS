2. Create and update .env file with OpenAI API key and other required environment variables[^1]
3. Install required dependencies using yarn/bun/npm install[^1]

### Running the Project

- Production mode: `yarn start`[^1]
- Development mode: `yarn dev` (caution: may lead to high costs due to frequent AI model calls)[^1]


### Technology Stack

- OpenAI GPT-4 - AI model[^1]
- Dall-E 3 - Image generation[^1]
- Ffmpeg - Video editing library[^1]
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime[^1]
- Express - Web framework[^1]
- FFCreatorLite - Image to video library[^1]


### Known Issues

- Final video file placement inconsistency[^1]
- Audio clipping issues with FFMPEG[^1]


## Multi-Speaker Voiceover Guidelines

### Script Structure for Multiple Speakers

```
[Narrator]: "Main introduction to the topic"
[Character Voice]: "Dialogue representing a perspective"
[Second Character]: "Contrasting view or additional information"
[Narrator]: "Conclusion or transition"
```


### InVideo Multi-Speaker Workflow

1. Select "Use My Script" flow
2. Add up to 5 speakers + 1 narrator
3. Assign appropriate voices to each speaker
4. Label speakers in your script using format: [Speaker Label]: "Dialogue"[^1]

### Voice Assignment Best Practices

- Use contrasting voices to highlight conflicts (e.g., different accents)
- Keep narrator voice neutral to frame debates
- Sync speakers with appropriate visuals
- Use text overlays to reinforce speaker roles[^1]


## File Management

### File Paths

The document contains multiple file paths and references to various HTML, PHP, and media files, suggesting a web development project with multimedia elements[^1]
