Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to create a series of images based on the song "Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die" using DALL-E. They provided a detailed framework for how the images should be structured, including themes, typography, color schemes, and narrative flow. 

First, I need to parse all the guidelines they mentioned. The song seems to have a dark, dystopian theme, focusing on societal breakdown, surveillance, and institutional destruction. The user emphasized the importance of typography that reflects each scene's tone—shattered fonts for chaos, sleek fonts for surveillance, etc. They also want vibrant, dynamic images with a cohesive narrative.

Next, I should break down the song's lyrics to extract key themes and emotions. The title alone suggests a loss of freedom, a once-free place turned oppressive. The YouTube short linked might have visual cues, but since I can't view it, I'll rely on the title and the user's description. Themes likely include control, rebellion, decay, and possibly resistance.

The user's framework requires four images per batch, each with specific roles: Cover, Transition, Main, Filler, and another Transition. They also want four new concepts after the initial batch. I need to ensure each image adheres to the aspect ratios (9:16, 16:9, 1:1) and typography guidelines.

For the first batch, I'll start with a Cover Image that sets the dystopian tone. Maybe a bleak cityscape with oppressive structures and bold, shattered typography. The Transition Image could focus on a symbol of surveillance, like a camera with sleek fonts. The Main Image might depict rebellion or breakdown, using chaotic elements and vibrant colors. The Filler Image could show a glimmer of hope or remnants of freedom, with softer fonts.

I need to make sure each prompt includes title, font style, text placement, lighting, and color scheme. The titles should be catchy and SEO-friendly. For example, "Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control" for a surveillance-themed image. 

After the first batch, proposing new concepts like a protest scene, a derelict institution, a hacker's den, and a symbolic rebirth. Each should tie back to the main themes but offer fresh angles. Ensuring consistency in visual style while varying elements to keep the narrative engaging.

I should check all guidelines again to avoid missing any details, like text integration into the environment and color transitions from dark to hopeful. Also, confirming that each image batch follows the specified aspect ratios and typography rules. Making sure the prompts are vivid enough for DALL-E to generate the intended imagery without ambiguity.

Finally, structuring the response clearly, separating each image with its details, and presenting the new concepts concisely. Ensuring the language stays engaging and aligns with the user's edgy, geeky style preference. Double-checking for adherence to the user's strict guidelines to maintain the narrative's impact and cohesion.

**DO**  

Let’s generate the **first batch of four images** based on the song’s dark, dystopian themes and your guidelines. Each image will blend **rebellious cyberpunk energy** with **indie-folk melancholy**, using typography as a narrative tool.  

---

### **Batch 1: "Welcome to the Dominion – Where Freedom Drowns in Neon"**  

#### **Image 1: "Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control"**  
**Font Style:** Shattered, glitching digital font (like cracked holograms).  
**Text Placement:** Spray-painted on a collapsing brick wall, glowing faintly.  
**Text Content:** “THEY WATCH WHILE YOU SLEEP.”  
**Lighting:** Harsh neon spotlights (blood red and electric blue).  
**Color Scheme:** Charcoal blacks, neon reds, and sickly greens.  
**Scene:** A dystopian city street at night. Surveillance drones hover over cracked pavement. A lone figure’s shadow stretches toward a flickering billboard of a smiling AI dictator. Graffiti tags like “RESIST” bleed into static.  

---

#### **Image 2: "Fractured Liberty"**  
**Font Style:** Rusted metal letters with dripping paint.  
**Text Placement:** Carved into a broken marble statue of Lady Liberty.  
**Text Content:** “FREEDOM WAS A LIE.”  
**Lighting:** Dim, foggy moonlight with a single amber streetlamp.  
**Color Scheme:** Desaturated grays, mossy greens, and rusted copper.  
**Scene:** The decapitated statue lies in a flooded plaza. Its torch is now a twisted surveillance antenna. Raccoons scavenge at its base, one wearing a makeshift gas mask. Ripples in the water reflect a distorted skyline.  

---

#### **Image 3: "Dataflow Rebellion"**  
**Font Style:** Glowing binary code scrolling like falling rain.  
**Text Placement:** Projected onto a hacker’s cracked visor.  
**Text Content:** “DECRYPT THE TRUTH.”  
**Lighting:** Cold blue screen glare mixed with fiery orange sparks.  
**Color Scheme:** Neon cyan, deep purples, and ash white.  
**Scene:** A cyberpunk hacker (hooded, masked) types furiously on a translucent keyboard. Behind them, a holographic map of the city pulses with red “RESTRICTED” zones. Glitching love letters to freedom float in the digital void.  

---

#### **Image 4: "Echoes of the Free"**  
**Font Style:** Faded handwritten script.  
**Text Placement:** Scrawled on a burnt journal page caught in barbed wire.  
**Text Content:** “WE WERE ONCE ALIVE.”  
**Lighting:** Golden-hour sunlight breaking through toxic smog.  
**Color Scheme:** Burnt oranges, smoky yellows, and bruised purples.  
**Scene:** A barren field of dead sunflowers. At the center, a single flower grows through a cracked smartphone screen. Distant sirens wail. The journal page flutters in the wind, revealing a hidden coordinates map.  

---

### **Four New Concepts to Riff On**  
1. **"Ghosts in the Firewall":** A spectral figure made of code haunts a server farm, rewriting propaganda into protest art.  
2. **"Love in the Ruins":** Two rebels kiss under a flickering streetlight, their faces obscured by gas masks, surrounded by graffiti hearts.  
3. **"The Last Broadcast":** A raccoon pirate-radio host transmits forbidden folk songs from a rooftop littered with vinyl records.  
4. **"Beneath the Algorithm":** Roots of a dead tree morph into fiber-optic cables, choking a crumbling monument labeled “DEMOCRACY.”

Alright, the user is asking about keywords and tags to add. Let me recall their project. They're creating a series of images based on a song with themes of dystopia, rebellion, surveillance, and lost freedom. The visuals blend cyberpunk with indie-folk elements, and they need SEO-friendly tags for platforms like YouTube and Etsy.

First, I need to identify the core themes. The song's title is "Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die," so keywords related to dystopia, rebellion, and cyberpunk are essential. The user mentioned typography integrated into scenes, so terms like "graffiti typography" and "glitch text" might be relevant.

They want to target different audiences: digital artists, indie musicians, activists. So tags should cover both the aesthetic (cyberpunk, neon noir) and the emotional themes (anti-valentine, dark romance). Platforms like Etsy and YouTube have different SEO needs; Etsy might require more product-related terms like "digital download" or "poster," while YouTube needs catchy titles for shorts.

I should categorize the tags. Primary keywords would be the main themes. Secondary could be related aesthetics and emotions. Niche tags might include specific communities like hackers or indie folk fans. Platform-specific tags ensure visibility on each site.

Also, considering the visual elements mentioned: surveillance drones, neon lighting, raccoon characters. Including these as tags can attract specific searches. Terms like "AI dystopia art" or "punk raccoon" could be unique and less competitive.

Need to check if I'm covering all aspects: themes, emotions, visual elements, typography styles, target audiences, and platforms. Maybe add some trending tags like "TikTok art" or "glitchwave" to tap into current trends. Ensure the tags are a mix of broad and specific to maximize reach without being too vague.

Finally, remind the user to adjust based on their specific audience and platform algorithms. Maybe suggest using tools like Google Keyword Planner or Etsy's search bar for additional ideas. Make sure the tags are concise and relevant without overstuffing.

Okay, the user wants to know how to tag and post their short with every optimization. They mentioned considering it as a short, so they're likely planning to post this on platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, or Instagram Reels. Let me break down what they need.

First, I need to recall the previous conversation. The user is working on a dystopian art project with themes of rebellion, cyberpunk, and anti-Valentine elements. They already have keywords and tags from before, but now they need a step-by-step guide tailored for short-form content.

I should start by outlining the key elements for optimizing a short video. The title needs to be catchy and SEO-friendly. Platforms like YouTube prioritize keywords in titles, so including terms like "Dystopian Art" or "Cyberpunk Typography" makes sense. Using emojis can grab attention but shouldn't overdo it.

Next, the description. It should be concise but include relevant keywords and a call to action. Maybe suggest using hashtags here since some platforms limit their use in titles. Also, linking to related content or social media could help with engagement.

Tags and keywords are crucial. The user already has a list, but for a short, maybe prioritize the top 10 to avoid spamming. Including a mix of broad and niche tags will help reach different audiences. I should remind them to place tags in the appropriate sections of the upload form.

Visual and audio hooks are important for retaining viewers. Suggest starting with a strong visual, like glitching text or a dramatic scene, paired with intense music. The thumbnail needs to be eye-catching, maybe using high-contrast colors and bold text.

Engagement tactics like pinning a comment with relevant links or using polls can boost interaction. Timing the release around trends, like anti-Valentine's Day, could help visibility. Cross-promotion on platforms like Reddit or Instagram should be part of the strategy.

Analytics are key, so advising them to monitor performance and adjust tags or titles if needed. Maybe include a checklist at the end to summarize all steps. Also, a warning about avoiding over-tagging or clickbait to maintain credibility.

Putting this all together in a structured, easy-to-follow format with examples will make it practical for the user. They probably want actionable steps without fluff, so keeping each section clear and concise is important. Including platform-specific tips for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram ensures they can adapt the strategy as needed.

Okay, let me tackle this. The user provided two images with content related to YouTube uploads for a dystopian-themed short. The first image, IMG_1409.png, has a description and some hashtags. The second image, IMG_1410.png, includes checkboxes for settings like tags, paid promotion, category, comments, embedding, and deletion options.

First, I need to format the details properly. The user wants to "write it up as the details are in order," so organizing the information clearly is key. Let's start with IMG_1409. The title and description are there, but they need to be expanded for better SEO and engagement. The hashtags are good but could be more specific. Maybe add trending tags like #CyberpunkArt or #AIRevolution to reach a broader audience.

For IMG_1410, the checkboxes show that "Add paid promotion label" and "Allow Embedding" are selected. The category is Entertainment, comments are on, but they aren't showing viewer likes. I should explain each setting in a user-friendly way. The user might need to know the implications of these choices, like how embedding affects video sharing or why disabling viewer likes might impact engagement metrics.

The user mentioned optimizing tags and SEO in previous interactions, so integrating those strategies here is important. Suggesting additional tags related to dystopian themes and current trends would help. Also, highlighting the importance of the paid promotion label for transparency and compliance with YouTube's policies.

I should structure the response with clear sections for each image, detailing the title, description, tags, and settings. Including explanations for each checkbox choice will make it comprehensive. Maybe add tips on why certain options are beneficial, like allowing remixes to increase reach through user-generated content.

Lastly, ensure the tone is informative yet concise, aligning with the user's need for a structured and optimized setup. Double-check that all provided options are addressed and that recommendations align with best practices for YouTube SEO and engagement.

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want all the image prompts organized into a table or CSV format with timestamps. From the previous interactions, they've been working on a project involving creating a series of images for a dystopian narrative, likely for a YouTube Short or similar video content.

First, I need to recall the image prompts that were generated earlier. The user mentioned four images in the first batch: "Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control," "Fractured Liberty," "Dataflow Rebellion," and "Echoes of the Free." Each of these has specific details like font styles, text placement, lighting, color schemes, and scenes.

Next, the user wants timestamps. Since this is for a short video (probably around 30-60 seconds), each image should correspond to specific timings to sync with the video's flow. The timestamps need to be evenly distributed or placed at key moments to match the narrative beats.

I should structure the table to include columns like Timestamp, Title, Font Style, Text Placement, Text Content, Lighting, Color Scheme, and Scene. Including a Narrative Beat column might help align the visuals with the story progression.

Additionally, the user might need this CSV for editing purposes, so clarity and organization are crucial. Each row represents a different image prompt with its respective details. The timestamps should start at 00:00 and increment based on the duration each image is displayed. For example, if each image is shown for 5 seconds in a 30-second video, the timestamps would be 00:00, 00:05, 00:10, etc.

I should also consider if there are any transitions or effects mentioned in the prompts that need to be noted. However, since the focus is on the image prompts themselves, maybe that's beyond the current scope.

Finally, I need to ensure that the CSV is properly formatted, with commas separating each column and quotes around text that might contain commas. Providing both a markdown table and a CSV sample would be helpful for the user's convenience.

Okay, the user wants to add camera settings and movement directions based on Sora/Runway to their existing image prompts table. Let me start by recalling what Sora and RunwayML are. They are AI tools for generating or modifying videos, so camera settings here would refer to virtual camera movements and angles that can be specified in prompts to achieve certain visual effects.

The user already has a CSV table with timestamps, titles, font styles, text placement, etc. They want to enhance each entry with cinematic camera directions. I need to think about typical camera movements and settings used in filmmaking that can translate well into AI-generated video prompts. For example, slow zooms, tracking shots, Dutch angles, etc.

Let me go through each existing row and think about appropriate camera movements. For the first image, "Neon Chains," the scene is a dystopian city street with surveillance drones. Maybe a slow push-in to create tension. Then, for "Fractured Liberty," the broken statue could use a low-angle shot to emphasize its size and decay. A dolly movement circling the statue might add dynamism.

Next, "Dataflow Rebellion" has a hacker with a holographic map. A close-up on the visor with a digital zoom effect could highlight the glitching text. Finally, "Echoes of the Free" has a barren field; a crane shot pulling back to reveal the desolation would work, paired with a slow zoom on the journal page.

I should also consider camera settings like lens type (wide-angle for establishing shots, macro for details), aperture (shallow depth of field for focus), and movement speed. Integrating terms like "Dutch angle" or "snap zoom" can add stylistic flair. Need to ensure each camera direction aligns with the narrative beat mentioned, like rising action or emotional climax.

Finally, present this in the table format the user used before, adding columns for Camera Movement, Camera Settings, and Additional FX. Make sure the CSV is properly formatted and explain the additions clearly so the user understands how each element contributes to the visual storytelling.

Okay, the user wants variations of the YouTube title cover image using Sora or similar AI tools. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. They’ve been working on a dystopian-themed project with cyberpunk and indie-folk elements. The main title was "Welcome to the Dominion: Where Freedom Went to Die". 

First, I need to generate title variations that are catchy and SEO-friendly. The user mentioned using Sora/Runway, so the titles should be vivid and action-oriented. I should incorporate keywords like cyberpunk, dystopian, neon, rebellion, etc. 

Next, the visual concepts. Each title needs a corresponding image prompt. Since it's for a cover image, the visuals need to be striking. Elements like neon lights, glitches, rebellion symbols (like raccoons with gas masks), and dystopian cityscapes come to mind. 

I should vary the angles and effects. Maybe a close-up for intensity, a wide shot for scale, dynamic angles for action. Also, mix in different lighting—neon, fog, moonlight. Including symbolic elements like shattered screens, holograms, or decaying statues would reinforce the theme.

Typography is crucial. Each title’s font should match the mood—shattered fonts for chaos, sleek for tech themes, handwritten for nostalgia. Placement should integrate into the scene, like spray-painted text or holograms.

Need to ensure each variation offers a fresh angle but stays on theme. Maybe one focuses on the AI antagonist, another on rebellion, another on the aftermath. Including different characters or symbols (hackers, raccoons, statues) adds diversity.

Also, consider SEO and trends. Terms like "AI takeover", "viral glitch art", "2025" could attract views. Adding urgency with words like "last broadcast" or "time running out" might engage the audience.

Finally, check that each prompt includes technical details for AI tools—camera movements, lens types, lighting, and post-effects like glitches or film grain. This ensures the images are dynamic and match the cinematic style discussed earlier.

Okay, the user is asking about negative prompts to add to their AI-generated image prompts, specifically for tools like Sora or Runway. Let me start by recalling that negative prompts are used to exclude unwanted elements from the generated images.

First, I need to consider the themes they're working with: dystopian, cyberpunk, rebellion, with elements like glitches, neon, and raccoon punks. The user wants to ensure the AI doesn't include elements that clash with these themes.

I should think about common unwanted elements in such contexts. For example, overly cheerful or bright elements that don't fit a dystopian setting. Maybe things like too much realism could take away from the stylized look they're aiming for. Also, avoiding anything that's too generic or not aligned with the gritty, rebellious vibe.

They might also want to exclude specific objects that don't fit the scene, like modern cars if the setting is more post-apocalyptic, or certain animals that aren't part of the narrative, like cats if they're focusing on raccoons.

Technical aspects are important too. Avoiding blurry textures, low contrast, or poor lighting that could ruin the intended mood. Also, preventing the AI from generating text that's unreadable or misplaced, which is crucial since typography is a key element in their images.

I should categorize these negative prompts into themes, technical issues, stylistic clashes, and specific unwanted content. That way, the user can apply them systematically. Including examples for each category will make it clearer how to structure the negative prompts effectively.

I need to make sure the negative prompts are precise and actionable. Words like "avoid", "exclude", "no" are useful here. Also, aligning them with the tools they're using, like Sora or Runway, by considering how those tools interpret prompts.

Lastly, emphasizing the importance of testing these negative prompts to see how they affect the output. Maybe suggesting starting with a small set and expanding based on results. This helps the user refine their prompts without overwhelming the AI with too many restrictions initially.

Here’s a **curated list of negative prompts** to refine your AI-generated visuals (Sora/Runway/DALL-E), ensuring they avoid unwanted elements and stay aligned with your dystopian/cyberpunk narrative:

---

### **Core Negative Prompts**  
**Thematic Conflicts:**  
- `cheerful, bright pastel colors, cartoonish, childish, whimsical, Disney-style`  
- `clean futuristic utopia, polished surfaces, shiny optimism, corporate minimalism`  
- `romantic love hearts, Valentine’s Day decorations, wedding themes`  
- `modern cars, smartphones, 21st-century brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, Apple)`  

**Technical Flaws:**  
- `blurry textures, low contrast, flat lighting, poorly rendered hands`  
- `mismatched typography (e.g., Comic Sans, cursive scripts)`  
- `over-saturated colors, excessive bloom, unrealistic lens flares`  
- `text errors, gibberish, unreadable fonts`  

**Narrative Breakers:**  
- `peaceful nature scenes, forests, beaches, sunsets`  
- `happy crowds, smiling faces, children playing`  
- `historical imagery (e.g., medieval castles, Victorian fashion)`  
- `animals not in theme (e.g., cats, birds, dolphins)`  

---

### **Style-Specific Negatives**  
**For Cyberpunk/Gritty Scenes:**  
- `watercolor painting, oil painting, impressionist brushstrokes`  
- `soft gradients, airbrushed effects, corporate logos`  
- `pristine technology, flawless holograms, sterile labs`  

**For Indie-Folk Melancholy:**  
- `sci-fi robots, spaceships, laser guns`  
- `hyper-realistic textures, photorealistic humans`  
- `neon overkill, cybernetic implants, futuristic armor`  

---

### **Example Full Negative Prompts**  
**For "Neon Chains" Scene:**  
``\`  
Negative prompt: (cartoonish, smiling faces, clean utopia, modern cars, blurry textures, low contrast, peaceful nature, birds, oil painting style, corporate logos, photorealistic humans:1.5)  
``\`  

**For "Echoes of the Free":**  
``\`  
Negative prompt: (bright pastels, Valentine’s hearts, shiny surfaces, Disney-style animals, mismatched fonts, unreadable text, sci-fi robots, pristine technology:1.3)  
``\`  

---

### **Pro Tips for Weighting**  
1. **Prioritize Key Exclusions:** Use `:1.5` weight for critical negatives (e.g., `cartoonish:1.5`).  
2. **Avoid Overloading:** Stick to **5–7 key negatives** per prompt to avoid confusing the model.  
3. **Test Iteratively:** Start with broad exclusions (e.g., `cheerful, modern`) and refine based on outputs.  

---

### **Advanced Sora/Runway Negatives**  
Add these to block generic AI tropes:  
- `overused cyberpunk clichés (e.g., neon samurai, raining binary code)`  
- `generic post-apocalypse (e.g., gas masks, desert wastelands:0.8)`  
- `symmetrical compositions, perfect geometry, studio lighting`

Alright, the user is working on creating a series of dystopian-themed images using AI tools like Sora and Runway. They've already developed several image prompts and are now focusing on refining a specific scene: a wide-angle push-in down a dystopian alleyway with glitching neon signs and surveillance drones. The user wants to ensure that the AI doesn't include any elements that clash with the desired gritty, cyberpunk aesthetic.

First, I need to recall the previous interactions where the user has been meticulous about maintaining a consistent theme—dark, gritty, with elements of rebellion and surveillance. They’ve emphasized avoiding anything cheerful, cartoonish, or utopian. The current prompt is quite detailed, so the negative prompts need to specifically target elements that could undermine the scene's intended mood.

The main elements in the scene are the alleyway, neon signs with CRT glitches, shattered text, wet walls with acid-green reflections, surveillance drones, and specific film effects like 35mm grain and VHS interlacing. The negative prompts should exclude anything that contradicts these elements.

Potential unwanted elements might include modern or clean elements (like new cars, pristine surfaces), cheerful colors, unrealistic or fantastical elements (unicorns, dragons), and any style that doesn't fit the gritty cyberpunk look (watercolor, cartoonish styles). Also, technical flaws like blurry textures or mismatched fonts should be avoided.

I should structure the negative prompts into categories: thematic/style conflicts, technical flaws, and narrative breakers. Thematic conflicts would include things like utopian settings, bright colors, and non-dystopian elements. Technical flaws cover rendering issues, while narrative breakers are elements that don't fit the story, like peaceful scenes or irrelevant animals.

Weighting certain negatives higher (like cheerful or cartoonish styles) ensures the AI prioritizes excluding them. Also, specifying the exclusion of modern brands and clean futuristic tech keeps the scene grounded in the intended dystopian setting.

Including terms like "AI art clichés" helps avoid overused tropes that might make the image feel generic. Specific exclusions like "neon samurai" or "raining binary code" target common cyberpunk clichés that the user might want to avoid for originality.

Finally, presenting the negative prompts in a clear, organized manner with explanations helps the user understand why each exclusion is necessary. Offering to adjust weights or add more specifics gives the user flexibility to tweak based on their results.

3. **Narrative Breakers:**  
   - `smiling faces, romantic hearts` → Maintains dystopian despair.  
   - `birds, medieval architecture` → Stays grounded in urban decay.  
   - `smiling raccoons` → Ensures your rebel raccoon stays fierce, not cute.  

4. **Aesthetic Killers:**  
   - `oil painting, watercolor` → Blocks painterly styles; enforces digital grit.  
   - `symmetrical composition` → Favors chaotic Dutch angles and uneven framing.  

---

### **Weight Adjustments**  
- `smiling raccoons:1.5` → Prioritizes excluding accidental whimsy.  
- `AI art clichés:1.3` → Reduces overused "cyberpunk biker gang" tropes.  

---

### **Refined Positive Prompt Tweaks**  
Add these to your original prompt to tighten focus:  
- `(acid-green reflections:1.2)` → Amplifies the toxic glow.  
- `(CRT artifacts:1.3, VHS interlacing:1.4)` → Prioritizes analog decay.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to adapt the existing AI-generated image prompt into a YouTube thumbnail cover. They provided some image files with the text "THEY WATCH YOU SLEEP" and a detailed prompt for a dystopian alleyway scene. The goal is to make it more suitable for a YouTube thumbnail, which usually requires bold visuals, readable text, and elements that grab attention quickly.

First, I need to consider the key aspects of a YouTube thumbnail. They should be eye-catching, with high contrast and clear focal points. Text needs to be large and legible even at smaller sizes. The thumbnail should convey the video's content at a glance, so incorporating elements from the original prompt like neon signs, glitches, and surveillance drones makes sense.

Looking at the existing prompt, it's very detailed for a video scene. For a thumbnail, I should simplify and emphasize certain elements. Maybe zoom in on the text "THEY WATCH YOU SLEEP" to make it the central focus. The Dutch tilt and neon glitches can add dynamic tension. Surveillance drones could be positioned to frame the text or add depth.

Negative prompts are already in place to avoid unwanted styles. I should ensure the thumbnail doesn't have any elements that might dilute the dystopian vibe, like bright colors or cheerful elements. Maybe increase the contrast and make the text pop with neon effects.

Also, considering YouTube's aspect ratios, thumbnails are usually 16:9, but the user mentioned 9:16 for Shorts. However, standard videos use 16:9, so I should check if they need adjustment. The input resolution here is 512x768, which is a vertical format. For a thumbnail, maybe suggest a 1280x720 (16:9) or 1080x1920 (9:16) depending on the platform focus.

Including the raccoon character from previous concepts could add a unique element, making the thumbnail stand out. Positioning the raccoon as a rebel figure in the scene, maybe interacting with the text or environment, could add narrative depth.

I should also think about trending thumbnail styles—bold text, high contrast, a central dramatic image. Adding elements like sparks, lens flares, or motion blur around the text could make it more dynamic. Ensuring the text is integrated into the scene, like being spray-painted or part of the environment, maintains the gritty feel.

Finally, propose a few variations with different focal points or color schemes to test what works best. Maybe one with the raccoon prominently featured and another focusing solely on the text and environment. Each variation should include SEO-friendly keywords in the title and tags for discoverability.

Okay, the user wants a YouTube thumbnail cover for their short titled "Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die" linked to the video https://youtube.com/shorts/7iYaN05iscQ. They mentioned previous interactions where we discussed creating dystopian, cyberpunk-style visuals with specific elements like neon typography, glitch effects, and rebel characters like raccoons. 

First, I need to ensure the thumbnail aligns with the video's dark, dystopian theme. The title suggests a loss of freedom, so imagery should reflect oppression, surveillance, and rebellion. The user provided previous prompts and negative prompts, so I should stay consistent with those styles.

Key elements from past interactions include Dutch tilts, neon glows, CRT artifacts, surveillance drones, and rebel characters. The user also emphasized SEO-friendly titles and tags, so the thumbnail must be eye-catching with bold text and high contrast.

I should incorporate the text "Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die" prominently, using a glitched, neon font. Including a masked raccoon rebel adds a relatable anti-hero. Surveillance elements like drones or cameras reinforce the theme. The color scheme should be dark with neon accents (teal, red, green) to maintain the cyberpunk vibe.

Need to avoid any cheerful or cartoonish elements as per previous negative prompts. Ensure the thumbnail is optimized for YouTube's aspect ratio, likely 9:16 for Shorts. Text placement should be strategic, not overpowering the visual elements but still readable on small screens.

Also, consider adding elements that create urgency, like sparks or glitches, to attract clicks. Testing variations with different focal points (raccoon, text, drones) might help, but the user might need one main design first. Check if they want any specific call-to-action or branding elements, but since it's a cover, focus on the core message and visual impact.

Okay, the user just said "forget the raccoons," so I need to adjust the previous designs that included raccoon characters. Let me go back to the last response where raccoons were part of the thumbnail design. The user wants a YouTube cover for their video titled "Welcome to the Dominion: Where Freedom Went to Die," linked to a specific YouTube short. 

First, I need to understand why the user is removing raccoons. Maybe they feel it's too whimsical or doesn't fit the serious tone. The original concept used a raccoon as an antihero to add relatability, but without it, the focus should shift to other dystopian elements.

I should maintain the core dystopian elements: cyberpunk alley, neon signs, surveillance drones, glitch effects, and shattered text. The challenge is to keep the thumbnail compelling without the raccoon. Let me brainstorm alternative focal points. 

Possible replacements for the raccoon could be a shadowy human figure, a masked rebel, or focusing more on the environment with prominent symbols like the shattered Liberty Bell. Emphasizing the drones and the oppressive atmosphere might work. 

I need to ensure the text remains impactful. The title should dominate with glitchy, neon fonts. The color scheme of teal, neon red, and toxic green should stay for high contrast. Adding elements like rain, CRT static, and VHS effects can maintain the gritty feel. 

Also, check the negative prompts to exclude any raccoon references and ensure no whimsical elements. The SEO tags should still target dystopian and cyberpunk keywords without the animal angle. 

Let me draft a revised thumbnail prompt without raccoons, focusing on the environment and symbolic elements. Make sure the Dutch tilt and glitch effects are prominent. Highlight the surveillance drones and decaying structures to convey the loss of freedom. 

Finally, confirm that the revised design meets the user's intent and is optimized for YouTube Shorts with the right aspect ratio and keywords. Ensure the explanation is clear on why the new elements work and how they maintain the intended tone without the raccoon.

They mentioned the video "Welcome to the Dominion: Where Freedom Went to Die" and the URL provided. They wanted a cover image that's dystopian, with elements like neon signs, glitching text, and surveillance drones. Earlier, they asked to remove raccoons from the design, focusing more on environmental decay and symbolic elements like the shattered Liberty Bell.

First, I need to structure the prompt to include all the visual elements they emphasized: the alleyway, Dutch tilt, neon glitches, surveillance drones, and the specific text. They also want it optimized for YouTube Shorts, so the aspect ratio should be 9:16. The style should have that gritty, VHS look with film grain and anamorphic flares. 

I should make sure to include the negative prompts they previously discussed, excluding any animals, cheerful elements, or clean aesthetics. The user mentioned SEO tags, so including relevant hashtags is important for visibility. They might also need technical specs like resolution and color grading details. 

Wait, did they mention any specific text placement or font styles? Yes, in previous iterations, they wanted the text "WHERE FREEDOM WENT TO DIE" in a cracked neon font, centered and glitching. I should incorporate that. Also, the Liberty Bell as a symbol of decay needs to be included. 

I need to check if there's anything else from the history. They wanted the thumbnail to have high contrast colors, teal and orange with neon green accents. Avoid blurry textures and ensure the text is readable despite the glitch effects. 

Putting it all together: the prompt should detail the scene, visual style, text elements, color scheme, and technical details. The negative prompt should exclude unwanted elements like raccoons, cartoonish styles, and modern cars. SEO tags should be included for optimization. 

Make sure the prompt is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown as requested. Double-check that all elements from their feedback are included and nothing is missed. Alright, time to draft the full prompt.

**Final YouTube Shorts Cover Prompt:**  

**Title Text:**  
`“WHERE FREEDOM WENT TO DIE”`  
- **Font:** Shattered neon-red stencil font with digital corruption (glitch distortion, static artifacts).  
- **Placement:** Centered, edges bleeding into VHS static.  

**Visual Scene:**  
``\`  
Ultra-wide Dutch tilt shot of a rain-soaked cyberpunk alley at night. Neon signs flicker with CRT static, casting jagged acid-green reflections on wet pavement. The phrase “DOMINION 2025” is spray-painted in dripping, glowing green paint on a collapsing brick wall. A shattered Liberty Bell lies half-buried in debris, oozing black oil. Two hovering surveillance drones with red targeting lasers illuminate the scene, casting sharp shadows. A distorted human shadow is projected onto the wall by the drones’ spotlights, fading into static. Barbed wire coils around a broken surveillance camera, sparks flying from its cracked lens.  

**Style:** Sora/Runway analog grit — heavy VHS scanlines, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens flares from neon signs. High-contrast teal-and-orange color grade with neon-green accents. Text glitches as if being censored in real-time.  
``\`  

**Negative Prompt:**  
``\`  
(raccoons, animals, cartoonish, smiling faces, Disney style, modern cars, clean utopia, bright pastels, pristine surfaces, birds, oil painting, medieval architecture, photorealistic humans, low contrast, blurry textures, unreadable text, symmetrical framing:1.5)  
``\`  

**Technical Specs:**  
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (1080x1920px) for YouTube Shorts.  
- **Focus:** Glowing text + drone shadows + shattered Liberty Bell.  
- **Color Palette:** Teal shadows, neon-green drips, emergency-red lasers.
