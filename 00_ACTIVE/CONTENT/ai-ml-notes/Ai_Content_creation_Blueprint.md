 - model: `deepseek-reasoner` | time: `2025-02-12T01:15:32.562000+08:00`

```markdown
Okay, so I need to analyze these YouTube video titles and suggest where to start. Let me see. The user provided a list of videos with titles, views, upload dates, and VPH (views per hour, maybe?). The goal is to figure out a starting point for someone looking to create content based on this data.

First, I'll look for patterns or trends. The titles mention niches like AI content creation, faceless channels, specific video types (anime motivational, animal rescue, etc.), monetization strategies (AdSense, affiliate marketing), and the use of AI tools. Views and VPH might indicate popularity and current traction.

The top videos by views are "How I use Deepseek AI for Content Creation" with 28.9K views in 13 days, "How to Create Anime Motivational Videos" with 46.2K views in a month, and "How I Create Animal Rescue Videos With AI" with 19.6K views in a month. The VPH is highest for the first one at 79, then 32 and 24. That suggests that the AI content creation topic is currently trending or has higher engagement.

Looking at the dates, some videos are recent (e.g., 16 days ago) while others are older, up to a year. The more recent ones with higher VPH might be more relevant for current trends. However, some older videos have very high views, like "Copy Videos from Chinese app..." with 136.5K views a year ago. But VPH is lower now, so maybe it's saturated.

Monetization is a common theme, with mentions of $100/day, $50k/month, etc. Faceless channels are also recurring, which is appealing for creators wanting anonymity. The use of free AI tools is emphasized in several titles, which is good for beginners with limited resources.

Potential niches to consider: AI-generated content (like animal fusion, baby animals, anime), faceless channels (travel, finance, horror), and specific formats (podcast clips, 3D animated stories). High CPM niches like finance, luxury, health are mentioned, which could be lucrative.

Possible starting points could be based on low competition but high demand. The AI Content Creation video (28.9K views, 13 days ago, 79 VPH) seems hot. Also, the Anime Motivational Videos (46.2K views, 1 month, 32 VPH) has high views. However, competition might be higher there. Maybe the "Deep Sea Giant Videos" (7.5K views, 21 days ago, 3 VPH) is a newer niche with less competition but still growing.

Alternatively, looking at tools required: some videos use free AI tools, which is accessible. For example, "Create Viral AI Baby Animal Videos" (57.2K views, 4 months ago) uses free tools. That could be a good start since it's proven and low cost.

Another angle is monetization method. Affiliate marketing combined with AdSense is mentioned in several titles. For example, the "Book Summary Videos" combine YouTube with Amazon Affiliate. Maybe a niche that allows multiple revenue streams is better.

Also, considering the ease of content creation: some videos mention using mobile apps or specific platforms (Chinese apps, Android/IOS devices). If the process is simpler, it might be easier to start.

Potential pitfalls: Copyright issues when re-uploading content from other platforms. The video about copying from Chinese apps has high views but mentions avoiding copyright, which might be risky. Better to focus on original content created with AI to avoid such issues.

In terms of sustainability, niches that rely on trends (like specific AI tools) might change quickly, while evergreen niches like finance, education, or travel could have longer viability.

Putting this all together, the best starting points would likely be niches that combine high demand (views/VPH), use free/accessible tools, have monetization potential, and lower competition. The AI Content Creation course (highest VPH) seems like a solid choice. Alternatively, the Anime Motivational Videos niche is also popular. For lower competition, maybe the Deep Sea Giant or Luxury niches, but they have lower VPH.

Another approach is to look for recurring themes: multiple videos on faceless channels, AI tools, and specific niches like animal rescue, finance, etc. The user could cross-reference which niches have multiple successful videos, indicating a proven track record.

In conclusion, starting with the AI Content Creation course makes sense as it's currently trending. Then, branching into a specific niche like Anime Motivational Videos or Animal Rescue using AI tools, ensuring the use of free resources and multiple monetization methods.

---

### **Final Recommendation**
**Start with the AI Content Creation Blueprint** (Deepseek AI video) to build a foundation in AI tools. Then, pivot to **Animal Rescue or Anime Motivational Videos** using free tools, as these niches have proven demand and monetization potential. For long-term growth, explore high-CPM niches like finance or luxury once you’ve established a workflow. Always prioritize originality to avoid copyright issues and leverage affiliate marketing for diversified income.
