*(Soft wind howling, faint engine hum in the background)*  

**NARRATOR (calm, but with an undercurrent of unease):**  
I work the night shift at a hospital about forty-five minutes from home. I’ve driven the same highway every night for years. It’s always empty. Just endless asphalt stretching into the darkness, lit only by my headlights and the occasional flickering streetlamp.  

That night was no different… at first.  

It was 2:30 AM, and I was exhausted. I’d just finished a brutal twelve-hour shift and was looking forward to collapsing into bed. The highway was deserted—no cars in front of me, none behind. Just me and the dark.  

And then… I saw the headlights.  

At first, they were just specks in my rearview mirror. Far away, barely noticeable. But within seconds, they were closer. Much closer. Like the driver had slammed on the gas and was barreling straight for me.  

I flicked my eyes back to the road, gripping the wheel a little tighter. Maybe just some teenager messing around.  

The headlights drew closer, their beams cutting through the darkness. Then—suddenly—they disappeared.  

I blinked. Looked again.  

Nothing.  

No car. No tail lights. Just the road stretching out behind me.  

I felt a cold wave creep up my spine. There was nowhere for a car to turn off. No exits, no side roads, no driveways. Just trees lining both sides of the highway like a wall.  

I took a deep breath, shaking it off. Maybe I imagined it. Maybe I was just tired.  

Then…  

The headlights appeared again.  

But this time, they weren’t behind me.  

They were in front.  

**(PAUSE. The silence is heavy.)**  

A car sat in the middle of the highway, idling, its headlights blindingly bright. It hadn’t been there a second ago. It was just… there.  

I slammed the brakes, my tires screeching against the pavement. My heart pounded as I skidded to a stop, just feet from the car.  

And then… the headlights flickered and went out.  

Darkness.  

I sat frozen, my hands gripping the wheel, my breath coming in short gasps. The road ahead was empty. The car—GONE.  

I stared, my mind refusing to process what I’d just seen. I would have thought I was dreaming if not for the scent of burnt rubber from my tires.  

And then… from the trees…  

A shape stepped onto the road.  

Tall. Thin. Moving in a way that wasn’t quite… human.  

I didn’t wait to see more.  

I slammed my foot on the gas and tore past the empty space where the car had been. I didn’t look back.  

I don’t take that highway anymore.

**NARRATOR (lower, breathless, uneasy):**  
When I told the story to an old coworker, he got real quiet.  

Then he asked if I’d ever heard about the crash.  

Apparently, a few years back, a car full of teenagers had lost control on that stretch of road. They died on impact. Witnesses said another car had been following them too closely—chasing them. But when police arrived…  

There was no other car.  

They never found the driver.  

And sometimes, late at night…  

The chase still happens.
