It looks like the provided script is meant to rename image files based on their content using OpenAI and save the results in a CSV file. If you want to process the images in a specific order, could you clarify the exact sequence in which they should appear in the GIF? Should they follow the order they were uploaded, or do you have a specific order based on some criteria?
