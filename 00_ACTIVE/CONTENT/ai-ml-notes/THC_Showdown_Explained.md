Ah, the majestic world of THC percentages—where numbers mean everything until you actually smoke it and realize it’s all just vibes and regret. Let’s break down your precious little buds, shall we?

---

### **1. Black Garlic – Indica – FLUENT Flower (3.5g)**
- **THC:** 30.11%  
- **CBD:** 0.06%  
- **Price:** $50.00 ($20/3.5g?)  
- **Form:** Flower (that you’ll stare at lovingly before combusting it)

**Verdict:**  
Oh look, it's the diva of the bunch. 30.11% THC—because obviously you’re trying to leave this planet, not just take a relaxing walk on it. Perfect for when you want your body to disappear while your brain plays static. And yes, *Black Garlic*—because what says “high as a kite” better than fermented vampire repellant?

---

### **2. Caramel Cream – Indica – Whole Flower (14g)**
- **THC:** 19.49%  
- **CBD:** 0.03%  
- **Price:** $90.00/14g  

**Verdict:**  
Oh, adorable. This one’s trying its best. A quaint little 19.49% THC—basically your grandma's cannabis. Great if you're looking to feel *something* but still want to remember your Netflix password afterward. Probably tastes like dessert and disappointment. Budget-friendly? Sure. Knockout punch? Not so much.

---

### **3. The Creamery – Indica – Bag-O – Whole Flower (14g)**
- **THC:** 21.80%  
- **CBD:** 0.07%  
- **Price:** $90.00/14g  

**Verdict:**  
This one’s sitting in that sweet middle child zone. Strong enough to make you forget about your ex, not strong enough to make you forget you texted them. 21.8% THC is the “I know what I’m doing” tier... until you're horizontal. Oh, and it’s called “Bag-O”? Classy. Very farm-to-couch.

---

### **TL;DR – The THC Olympics**

| Strain         | Type   | THC %  | Price     | Effect Summary                          |
|----------------|--------|--------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Black Garlic   | Indica | 30.11% | $50 (3.5g) | Say goodbye to motor function, probably |
| Caramel Cream  | Indica | 19.49% | $90 (14g) | Netflix and nap                         |
| The Creamery   | Indica | 21.80% | $90 (14g) | Functional stoner chic                  |

**Conclusion:**  
So basically, if you want to time-travel to the floor, grab the Black Garlic. If you want a light buzz while budgeting like it’s still 2008, go with Caramel Cream. And if you want to pretend you're not overdoing it while still very much overdoing it, The Creamery's your guy.

Need help picking your flavor of temporary oblivion? I'm here all day.

Ohhhh look at you, rolling in the discounts like a coupon-clipping cannabis connoisseur. A whole **$45 off $90**? Basically the weed gods are telling you to sin responsibly.

Let’s do the sarcastic math:

---

### 🥇 **Option 1: The Creamery – Indica – 14g – $90**
- **THC:** 21.80%  
- **Cost after discount:** $90 - $45 = **$45**
- **Result:** You walk away with a **half-ounce** of moderately punchy weed for $45. That’s like highway robbery... if you robbed *yourself* and somehow still won.
- **Bonus:** You get to tell your friends you bought weed in bulk like it’s Costco. “Yes, Brenda, that’s *14 grams*, because I’m an *adult.*”

---

### 🥈 **Option 2: Caramel Cream – Indica – 14g – $90**
- **THC:** 19.49%  
- **Cost after discount:** Also **$45**  
- **Result:** Slightly weaker, but still a full 14g for the same price. This one’s for the mellow soul who wants to get high but also remember how to microwave a burrito afterward.

---

### ❌ **Option 3: Black Garlic – Indica – 3.5g – $50**
- **THC:** 30.11%  
- **Cost after discount:** *LOL no.* Doesn’t even hit the $90 threshold. You could *add* something else to hit it, sure, but now you’re trying too hard. Also: 3.5g for $90? Are you buying weed or a down payment on a Tesla?

---

### 🧠 Final Advice from Your Sarcastic Life Coach:

Go with **The Creamery – 14g for $45.**  
- Solid THC.  
- Full half ounce.  
- Price of a sad fast food dinner.

Because honestly? If you don’t choose **$45 for 14g**, the only thing you'll be smoking is regret.

Want me to help you build a rotation of highs with this discount? Because I *definitely* have sarcastic opinions on that too.

Oh wow, a math question? What is this, *Weedonomics 101*?

Let’s break it down for those of us who totally didn't forget how the metric system works during a bong rip:

---

### 💨 The Glorious Calculation:
- One **3.5g** item is what the cool kids call an **"eighth"** (because 3.5g ≈ 1/8 oz, not because weed dealers love fractions).
- You’ve got **14g** in that big ol’ bag.

So...

**14g ÷ 3.5g = 4**

---

### 🧠 Translation:
One 14g bag = **Four 3.5g items**  
So if you're buying that half-ounce bag, you're basically getting **four eighths**... without paying four times the price.

---

### 🎤 Conclusion:
It’s like buying a four-pack of chaos instead of four single-serving containers of mayhem. Way more *blunt* for your buck.

Need help stretching that 14g or turning it into a lineup of anxiety-shattering joints? I’m your sarcastic guide to all things herbal.

Oh. My. Ganja. You really just dropped the **weed menu of the gods** and asked me to find the “best deal”? Cool. Let me sift through this glorious buffet of THC like some sarcastic weed sommelier.

### 👑 Let's define "Best Deal," shall we?
You’re either after:
1. **Highest THC per dollar** – because you’re a bang-for-your-buck philosopher.
2. **Biggest quantity** – for the “I want to live in a fog bank” crowd.
3. **Premium quality** – if you care about flavor, terpenes, and pretending you're classy.
4. **LOL it’s just cheap and strong** – which is probably where you're leaning.

---

### 🏆 **Top Contenders**

#### 🧄 **Black Garlic (Flower – 3.5g)**
- **THC:** 30.11%
- **Price:** $20.00 (probably clearance before it combusts itself)
- **THC-per-dollar:** 1.505% per dollar

✅ **ABSURDLY underpriced for that THC**  
✅ **Whole flower**  
✅ You’re essentially robbing them

---

#### 💣 **FTH – SFV OG x Sherb BX1 (3.5g)**
- **THC:** 29.79%
- **Price:** $50.00  
- **THC-per-dollar:** 0.596% per dollar

❌ Same punch, more pain on the wallet  
❌ No discount, just vibes

---

#### 🍬 **FTH – Donny Burger (3.5g)**
- **THC:** 24.17%
- **Price (after 30% off):** $28.00  
- **THC-per-dollar:** 0.863% per dollar

Meh. Like a store-brand version of getting high.

---

#### 🧪 **Primus Cured Sugar [1g]**
- **THC:** 84.47%  
- **Price (after 40% off):** $33.00  
- **THC-per-dollar:** 2.56% per dollar

⚠️ It’s concentrate.  
⚠️ You need a dab rig or at least lungs that haven’t signed a waiver.  
✅ Highest THC-per-dollar in the game

---

### 🤯 FINAL VERDICT (Because obviously, you want the truth with sass)

| Product               | Form        | THC %   | Price | THC/$ Ratio | Deal Ranking         |
|------------------------|-------------|---------|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| Black Garlic (3.5g)   | Flower      | 30.11%  | $20   | **1.505**    | 🥇 **Best all-around** |
| Primus Cured Sugar    | Concentrate | 84.47%  | $33   | **2.56**     | 🥈 **If you're dabbing** |
| FTH SFV OG x Sherb BX1| Flower      | 29.79%  | $50   | 0.596        | 🥉 Nice, but overpriced |
| Donny Burger (3.5g)   | Flower      | 24.17%  | $28   | 0.863        | Budget option, barely |

---

### 💬 TL;DR
**Buy Black Garlic for $20.** You get over 30% THC in flower form for the price of a drive-thru lunch.  
If you're feeling like a chemistry experiment and want to set your brain on fire: **Primus Cured Sugar**.

Otherwise? Stick with the Garlic. It’s not just black—it’s magical.

Want me to calculate a **power combo with your $45 off $90 deal** that maximizes THC and quantity? Oh, you know I will.

Ahhh there it is. The **fine print curse** strikes again. Of course the $45 off *doesn't* apply to the stuff you actually want—because heaven forbid a weed deal actually make sense. No no, it has to apply to **full-priced flower only**, because rules are rules, and your happiness is apparently negotiable.

---

### 🧮 So here’s the situation:
- You need to hit **$90** in **full-priced flower only.**
- No discounts, no concentrate magic, just *pure, unadulterated flower* from the "we think it's still worth $90" shelf.
- Once you hit that sacred threshold, boom: $45 off.

Let’s play **Weed Jenga** with your dignity and do the math.

---

### 🥸 Full-Priced Flower Options (That Qualify)
Let’s go back to those 14g options because, surprise: they’re priced at **$90 flat** and full price.

#### 🛍️ The 14g Club:
1. **Caramel Cream** – Indica – 19.49% THC – $90
2. **The Creamery** – Indica – 21.80% THC – $90

✅ **Both are full-price.**
✅ **Both hit the $90 mark.**
✅ **Discount applies.**
💰 So you'd get them for **$45.**

---

### 🧠 So... what's the *best* option?

| Strain         | THC %  | Grams | Price (Pre-Discount) | Price (After $45 off) | Cost per gram | THC Level |
|----------------|--------|-------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Caramel Cream  | 19.49% | 14g   | $90                    | **$45**                 | **$3.21/g**    | 💤 Meh-ish |
| The Creamery   | 21.80% | 14g   | $90                    | **$45**                 | **$3.21/g**    | 😎 Better |

🧾 **Conclusion: The Creamery is your best bet.**  
You're still paying just **$3.21 per gram** for 14g of moderately potent weed that *isn't* pretending to be something it's not. It’s full price, so the discount hits, and you get a half-ounce of decent indica for the price of a sad dinner date.

---

### 💡 Bonus Sarcastic Life Hack:
If you *must* hit $90 and you *don’t* want 14g of just one strain, you could:
- Buy 2–3 different **full-priced 3.5g** options to mix it up.
- Example: 3 x $30 = $90 → Apply discount → Pay $45 for 10.5g across three strains.

But let’s be real: **The Creamery 14g for $45 is unbeatable.**

Want me to Frankenstein together a $90 combo from full-price 3.5g options so you can taste the rainbow? I live for this.

Oh wow, it's a **THC showdown between Caramel Cream and The Creamery**, and honestly, this is the most dramatic thing since your grinder ghosted you.

Let’s break it down like we’re judging a cannabis-themed *Bachelor* episode: *One of these buds is getting the rose... and your $45 discount.*

---

### 💥 **Caramel Cream** – "The Chill Therapist in Sweatpants"
- **THC:** 19.49% – Cute, like the weed equivalent of a weighted blanket.
- **CBD:** 0.03% – So basically, decorative.
- **Lineage:** Maple Leaf × BlueBack × Skunk – Ah yes, *fragrant tragedy with a side of nostalgia.*
- **Flavor:** Spicy, sweet, skunky. Like a churro that fell in a compost bin.
- **Effects:** Great for stress, anxiety, pain, and “existing while being overwhelmed.”

🧠 **Verdict:** It’s soft, it’s warm, it probably hugs you back. But at 19.49% THC, it's not here to blow minds—it’s here to whisper “you’re okay” while you melt into your couch.

---

### 🍰 **The Creamery** – "The Dessert Influencer with a Dark Side"
- **THC:** 21.8% – Now we’re cooking. Or rather, *baking*.
- **CBD:** 0.06% – Still a formality, but a slightly more ambitious one.
- **Lineage:** Ice Cream Cake × Blowpops – The child of a bakery and a trap house.
- **Flavor:** Creamy cake meets “subtle hints of glue” – because who doesn’t love dessert with a side of adhesive fumes?
- **Effects:** Smooth, indulgent, relaxing. This is what you smoke when you want to feel like you’re inside a lava lamp.

🧠 **Verdict:** Higher potency, better lineage, actual *flavor flex.* This is for people who want their high to come with personality—and maybe an aftertaste of regret if you hit it too hard.
