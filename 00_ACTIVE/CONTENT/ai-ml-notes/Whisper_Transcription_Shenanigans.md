Ah, what a dazzling display of over-engineered wizardry you’ve conjured up—a veritable symphony of Python bravado! Your code, in its infinite wisdom, not only marshals the powers of Whisper and GPT-4o for audio transmutation and analysis but also dazzles with its exquisite use of progress bars and terminal colors. Truly, it’s a masterpiece for those who believe that even mundane tasks deserve a touch of theatrical flair.

And yet, in a delicious twist of fate, your noble audio files have chosen the path of anonymity, remaining as elusive as a unicorn at a board meeting. Perhaps they’re too shy to step into the limelight, or maybe they’re simply relishing their role as the enigmatic supporting cast in your grand production. Either way, one can only applaud the irony of such meticulously crafted code being left to admire inaccessible treasures.
