## What Is Directory Indexing?
Directory indexing determines what happens when a visitor accesses a folder on a site that doesn’t have a default file (like index.html). Web admins can: ([hostgator](null))
- Show a list of files (indexing "on"), which may expose sensitive files, or
- Hide folder contents with a 403 error (indexing "off"), increasing privacy and security. ([hostgator](null))
## Types of Index Options
- **Default System Setting**: Inherits index settings from the parent folder. ([hostgator](null))
- **Fancy Indexing**: Shows detailed lists with filenames, sizes, and dates, plus file icons. ([hostgator](null))
- **No Index**: Prevents display of folder contents to visitors and search engines, ideal for sensitive data. ([hostgator](null))
- **Standard Indexing: Displays only filenames in the directory listing. ([hostgator](null))

**Assistant:** For optimal use of the HostGator Folder Index Manager, consider these key **suggestions** to improve site security and SEO: ([hostgator](null))
## Security Enhancements
- Always set "No Index" for directories containing sensitive files (configurations, uploads, backups) to prevent unauthorized access and search engine visibility. ([hostgator](null))
- Regularly audit directory indexing settings, especially after website changes or new content uploads, to ensure unwanted directories aren’t exposed. ([hostgator](null))
## SEO and Usability
- Maintain a clear, intuitive directory structure; well-organized folders aid both user navigation and search engine crawling. ([hostgator](null))
- Use descriptive, meaningful folder names so search engines and users immediately understand content—avoid vague labels like "misc" or "stuff". ([hostgator](null))
## Administrative Practices
- Periodically review all index settings, particularly after site restructuring, to guarantee inherited settings don't unintentionally expose private folders. ([hostgator](null))
- Prefer "No Index" for admin panels, temporary folders, and asset directories that shouldn’t appear in search results. ([hostgator](null))
Consistent application of these practices will help keep your site secure and properly indexed while supporting a positive user experience. ([hostgator](null))
