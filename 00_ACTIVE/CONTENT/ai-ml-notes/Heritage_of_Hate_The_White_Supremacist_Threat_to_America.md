#### Heritage of Hate: The White Supremacist Threat to America

In this eye-opening video, we delve into the fragile state of the American dream and the growing issue of domestic terrorism fueled by hate and silence. We critique organizations like the Heritage Foundation, exposing their dangerous agenda that distorts patriotism to exclude diverse perspectives and undermine progress. Discover how "traditional values" have been co-opted to push a divisive, anti-immigrant, and anti-LGBTQ+ ideology. Learn about Project 2025, a plan for government takeover by Heritage loyalists aiming to dismantle protective institutions. Emphasizing the threat to democracy posed by white supremacy and Christian nationalism, we highlight the urgency of unity, action, and voting to combat hate and protect American values.
