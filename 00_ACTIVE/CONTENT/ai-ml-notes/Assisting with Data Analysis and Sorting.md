Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided two Google Sheets links and wants me to analyze and help sort them. First, I need to understand what they need. Since the links are to spreadsheets, they probably want some data analysis or organization help. But I can't actually view the sheets since I don't have access. So, maybe I should ask them to share the data or describe what's in the sheets. Wait, the user might not realize that I can't access external links. So, I should inform them about that and ask for more details. Let me check the links again: they are Google Sheets, which require permission. Without access, I can't analyze the data. So my first step is to let them know that I can't access the files and request they provide the data directly, maybe by pasting it here or sharing specific details. Also, I should ask what exactly they need help with—like sorting by certain columns, data cleaning, or something else. Maybe they have a specific goal in mind, like organizing the data alphabetically, by date, or filtering certain entries. Without knowing the content or structure, it's hard to proceed. So, I'll need to prompt them to provide more information about the data and their objectives. That way, I can give more targeted advice. Let me structure this into a helpful response.

```markdown
I cannot directly access or analyze the contents of Google Sheets documents shared via links, as I do not have permission to view external files. To assist you, please:

1. **Share the data directly** (e.g., paste a sample, describe columns, or share anonymized data).
2. **Specify your goal**: What analysis or sorting do you need? For example:
   - Sorting by a specific column (e.g., dates, numbers, categories).
   - Identifying patterns, duplicates, or errors.
   - Merging data from the two sheets.
   - Creating summaries or visualizations.

Once you provide details, I can guide you on methods, formulas (e.g., `SORT`, `VLOOKUP`), or tools to organize your data effectively. Let me know!
