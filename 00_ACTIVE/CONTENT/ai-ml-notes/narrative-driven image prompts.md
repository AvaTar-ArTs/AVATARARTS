Absolutely! Here’s how you can create **detailed, narrative-driven image prompts** (with transitions, filler images, and typography notes) for your TrashCats universe—using exactly the “template word” logic and the storytelling, context, and emotional depth you’ve established.

Below, you’ll find a structured template system. Each template prompt uses placeholders like `{{character}}`, `{{emotion}}`, `{{scene}}`, or specific lyrics/lines, so you can adapt it for any song section, character, or theme—**without hardcoding**. This makes it flexible for batch generation or remixing the narrative.

## **TrashCats Narrative Image Prompt Template System**

---

### **1. Cover Image Template**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: {{song_title}} – {{episode_name}} (Cover Image)
Visual: A wide-angle, cinematic shot of {{scene}} in HeartBreak Alley. The focus is on {{character}}, depicted {{emotion}}—framed by neon-lit graffiti, flickering alley lights, and symbolic objects (e.g., a cracked guitar, spray-paint can, or torn band poster). 
Typography: Bold, distressed font reading “{{main_lyric_or_theme}}” integrated into the environment—spray-painted on a dumpster, carved into a wooden sign, or glowing in digital haze.
Lighting & Color: High-contrast neon (pinks, cyans, golds) against deep shadows, with rain or mist for mood.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 9:16.
SEO/Platform Notes: Use trending keywords (“trashpunk,” “grunge,” “nocturne melodies”) for YouTube/Etsy.
```

---

### **2. Transition Image Template**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: {{song_title}} – {{transition_name}}
Visual: A close-up on a symbolic object ({{object}}) associated with {{character}}’s journey. The object is set against a blurred backdrop of graffiti walls or neon reflections. 
Typography: Fading or glitching text (“{{transition_lyric}}”) appears through dripping ink or smoke, subtly woven into the surface of the object (e.g., the handle of a trashcan, or reflected in a puddle).
Lighting & Color: Muted, dreamlike colors with spot highlights.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 1:1.
```

---

### **3. Main Image Template**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: {{song_title}} – {{main_event}}
Visual: The core action or emotional moment—e.g., {{character}} and the raccoon band performing atop overturned dumpsters, or a showdown with the howling alley cat under a neon sign. Surroundings show chaos (trash fires, urban critters, torn posters).
Typography: Bold, jagged, or shattered fonts (“{{core_lyric}}”) stenciled onto walls or glowing across a neon sign—integral to the scene.
Lighting & Color: Electric purples, toxic greens, harsh whites; strong contrast for drama.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 9:16.
```

---

### **4. Filler/Reflection Image Template**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: {{song_title}} – {{reflection_theme}}
Visual: A quieter, reflective moment—e.g., {{character}} crouched in shadow, spray-painting lyrics, or lost in memory beneath a willow tree. Discarded objects (photos, letters) scatter in the background.
Typography: Handwritten, faded text (“{{filler_lyric}}”) appears on a wall, lantern, or crumpled paper—evoking nostalgia or loss.
Lighting & Color: Warm, nostalgic golds and ambers; gentle shadows.
Aspect Ratio: 1:1 or 16:9.
```

---

### **5. Next-Scene Transition Image Template**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: {{song_title}} – {{next_scene}}
Visual: Pull back for a panoramic or overhead view—revealing more of HeartBreak Alley, the community, or the next stage of the story (e.g., a riot, alley gathering, dawn breaking over the city).
Typography: Ghostly, echoing text (“{{final_lyric}}”) fades into the background—etched into mist or distant billboards.
Lighting & Color: Fading night blues, early dawn pastels.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9.
```

---

## **How To Use Template Words: Best Practices**

* **Placeholder Variables:** Use intuitive variables: `{{character}}`, `{{emotion}}`, `{{object}}`, `{{main_lyric}}`, `{{scene}}`, etc. This ensures that the core structure of each prompt remains but you can quickly swap in different values for each new image or story section.
* **Batch Processing:** For each batch, fill in the placeholders with lyrics, character names, or narrative beats—either manually or via automation.
* **Consistent Style & Typography:** Use template notes to ensure recurring motifs—bold fonts for rebellion, handwritten for nostalgia, glitchy for digital/cyberpunk, always embedded into the environment (never pasted on).
* **SEO & Platform Focus:** Always include a `{{title}}` placeholder optimized for YouTube/Etsy, incorporating trend keywords for discoverability.

---

### **Example (filled for a verse):**

**Prompt:**

```
Title: Sammy’s Serenade – “Moonlit Heartache” (Cover Image)
Visual: A raccoon named Sammy stands in a rain-soaked, neon-lit alley, clutching a battered guitar under the flicker of a broken “HeartBreak Alley” sign. Torn posters and graffiti (“Eat Trash, Love Loud”) frame the scene. 
Typography: Bold, cracked white font reading “Moonlit nights and alley lights…” spray-painted diagonally on a dumpster.
Lighting & Color: Electric magenta, cyan, asphalt black.
Aspect Ratio: 16:9.
SEO/Platform: #Trashpunk #NocturneMelodies
```

---

## **Image Series Flow (for your song or any narrative)**

1. **Cover Image:** Set the world, mood, and core visual motifs.
2. **Transition Image:** Symbolic bridge or emotional pivot.
3. **Main Image:** Core action/beat (e.g., showdown, performance).
4. **Filler Image:** Quiet, reflective moment or aftermath.
5. **Next Transition:** Pan out or set up the next scene/chapter.

**Repeat with new variables and themes as the story evolves!**

---

## **In Practice**

* **Automate or repeat for each lyric line/scene:**

  * `{{character}} = Sammy`
  * `{{scene}} = moonlit alley`
  * `{{emotion}} = heartbreak/defiance`
  * `{{main_lyric}} = "Sammy sang in moonlit nights"`
* **You can even chain prompts:** e.g.,

  * Prompt 1: “Write a main image description for {{song\_title}} featuring {{character}} and the lyric {{main\_lyric}}.”
  * Prompt 2: “Write a transition image for the narrative moment following: {{main\_lyric}}.”

**Ready to build your own infinite alley of narrative images? 🚀**

create in TWO sets of Batches.. The First=Original Prompt + A variation image || THE SECOND=your own interpretation of the content as just as the first, TWO SEPERATE IMAGES
REMEMBER THE + == A SEPERATE Image SO TWO IMAGES TOTAL PER BATCH.
Thank you — this is a **great script** for batch-processing MP3 files: transcribing them with OpenAI Whisper, analyzing the lyrics with GPT, and linking timestamps. Since you're working at this level of detail and are asking about `"gpts": "lyrics-01"` and how to **fully simulate me (the Song & Music Lyrics Generator)** in code, let me now show you an equivalent Python script that does exactly **what I do as an AI songwriting assistant**, in that **same style**.

* Automatically creates and structures lyrics with metadata
* Sends a formatted request to a song-generation API
* Provides helpful CLI feedback and logging
* Uses `dotenv`, error handling, and terminal color output like your transcription pipeline

Would you like a version of this script where it **writes the generated song to disk**, or one that **parses lyrical structure dynamically based on user input**?

Visual and Typographic Guidelines

Aspect Ratio Defaults:

9:16 (1080x1920px): Use for dramatic, vertical compositions that draw the viewer’s eye upward. 16:9 (1280x720px): Ideal for broad, sweeping landscapes or expansive scenes. 1:1 (1024x1024px): Suitable for focused, central compositions that convey balance and equality. Typography:

Text Content: Ensure the text is impactful and concise, focusing on keywords that encapsulate the message’s essence. Lighting and Color:

Lighting: Use high contrast and dramatic lighting for dark themes, while employing soft, warm lighting for hopeful sections. Color Scheme: Dark and muted tones for foreboding scenes, with pops of red for danger or urgency. Transition to brighter, more vibrant colors to represent optimism and hope. Instructions for Image Generation Generate Images Based on Detailed Prompts:

Focus on bringing the narrative to life through imagery that reflects the emotional and thematic content. Adhere strictly to the guidelines for each theme to maintain consistency and impact. Suggestions for New Ideas:

After creating the primary images, propose four new concepts that build on the original theme but offer a fresh perspective or angle. This framework should guide the creation of visuals and narrative transitions, ensuring that each piece aligns with the overarching themes and delivers a powerful, cohesive message.

You now lets combine everything, and create the images, prompts, decriptive narritves trnsitions etc.
