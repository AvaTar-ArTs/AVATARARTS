\---

**[OPENING SCENE]**  
*Sound of a security camera feed humming, distant static. The screen flickers to grainy nighttime footage of an empty parking lot outside a small suburban office building.*  

**Narrator (Voiceover):**  
“This isn’t a campfire story. This isn’t fiction. What you’re about to see… happened to me last winter. I was working the night shift as a security guard at a quiet office complex. Or at least, it *seemed* quiet—until the cameras started showing things that shouldn’t exist.”  
*Pause. The camera feed glitches briefly, distorting the image.*  
“They say security footage never lies. But sometimes… it shows truths you wish you’d never seen.”

**[ACT 1: THE FIRST NIGHT]**  
*Sound design: The tick of a wall clock. A coffee machine gurgles in the background.*  

**Narrator:**  
“It started small. On my third night, I noticed motion alerts in the east hallway—Section B. But when I rewound the feed… nothing. Just shadows stretching longer than they should. Then, the *sounds* began.”  
*Sound design: A faint dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across carpet.*  
“I’d hear footsteps in empty corridors. Voices whispering through the vents. But every time I checked the cameras… silence. Just static.”  

**[DIALOGUE FLASHBACK]**  
*Narrator (to coworker over radio):*  
“Hey, you see anything on your end in Section B?”  
*Coworker (crackling static):*  
“Section B’s been closed for weeks. You’re alone there.”

**[ACT 2: THE FIGURE ON TAPE]**  
*Sound design: Keyboard clicks as the narrator fast-forwards footage. The screen flickers to 3:14 AM.*  

**Narrator:**  
“Then, on the fifth night, I saw *it*. A figure in the parking lot—tall, too thin, limbs… *wrong*. It stood perfectly still, facing the camera. But when I zoomed in…”  
*Sound design: A sharp inhale. The camera glitches again, revealing a blurred face with hollow eyes.*  
“Its head was tilted sideways. Like its neck was snapped. And it was *smiling*. Not a human smile. A rictus grin, stretching ear to ear.”  

**[DIALOGUE FLASHBACK]**  
*Narrator (panicked, calling police):*  
“There’s someone on the property—Section B! Send someone *now*!”  
*Dispatcher:*  
“Units are en route. Stay inside.”

**[ACT 3: THE CONFRONTATION]**  
*Sound design: Heavy breathing. A flashlight beam swings wildly across dark hallways.*  

**Narrator:**  
“I shouldn’t have gone out. But I had to know. The moment I stepped into Section B, the temperature dropped. My breath turned to fog. And then… I heard it. A wet, guttural *clicking*—like bones snapping.”  
*Sound design: The clicking grows louder, closer.*  
“I shone my light down the hall. There it was. That *thing*. Its head still crooked. Its smile wider. And it was… *crawling* toward me. Not on hands and knees. On *elbows and toes*, joints bending backward.”  

**[DIALOGUE FLASHBACK]**  
*Narrator (screaming into radio):*  
“WHERE ARE THE COPS?!”  
*Static. A distorted voice replies:*  
“**We’re already here.**”

**[ACT 4: THE UNRESOLVED]**  
*Sound design: Sirens wail. The camera feed cuts to daytime—police tape fluttering in the wind.*  

**Narrator:**  
“The police found me locked in a storage closet. No sign of the creature. No footprints. No broken doors. They said it was a panic attack. A hallucination. But two days later…”  
*Sound design: A VHS tape clicks into a player. Grainy footage plays of the narrator sleeping at his desk. The creature stands behind him, its hand resting on his shoulder.*  
“…this tape arrived at my house. No postage. No note. And every night since, my home security cameras pick up… *shapes*. Outside my windows. In my hallway. Always smiling. Always watching.”  

**[CLOSING]**  
*Sound design: A camera feed glitches to static. The narrator’s voice trembles.*  
**Narrator:**  
“I quit that job. But it doesn’t matter. They’re still out there. And now… they know where I live.”
