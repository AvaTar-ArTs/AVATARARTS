**Like all the best stories begin…**  

Once upon a time, a NuB fell in love with the chaos of Randoms and Group PuGs. As all n00berTs must endure, they faced endless FacePlants, countless respawns, and the grind of a lifetime. Thus was born this GayMer, a MinMax PoWeR GaMeR determined to conquer the Wilds of Infinite Grinds and Power-Leveling XP.  

This journey began in the Atlas City of Paragons, a realm of *City of Heroes*, alien invasions, and fully customized capes. But even heroes grow weary, and our adventurer fell into a long slumber. Awakened now in an era of Oblivion Portals and DRAGONs, they roam the High Isle of *Elder Scrolls Online*, battling through the beautifully messy lands of lore.  

Join the adventure, laugh at the chaos, and enjoy the tales of a true DoRkArY.

**Like all epic Elder Scrolls stories begin...**  

Once upon a time, a NuB ventured into Tamriel, fumbling through dungeons, surviving chaotic Group PuGs, and embracing the grind of endless FacePlants. Thus, this GayMer emerged—a MinMax PoWeR GaMeR, wielding wit and willpower to conquer the world of *Elder Scrolls Online*.  

From Oblivion Portals to DRAGONS, from Blackwood’s marshy depths to the sunlit shores of the High Isle, every adventure tells a story worth sharing. Whether it’s exploring new lore, dominating epic battles, or just laughing at the chaos of another FacePlant moment, Tamriel is where the magic happens.  

If you’re into beautifully messy adventures, chaotic group runs, and a bit of dorky humor, welcome to my DoRkArY. Let’s unravel the secrets of Tamriel together!
