            "type": "THINK",
            "content": "We are building an AI-powered PowerPoint generator using JavaScript and the PptxGenJS library.\n The core idea is to use Claude Sonnet (or similar LLM) to generate the content and structure of the presentation, then convert that into a PowerPoint file.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We will design a prompt for Claude that takes a topic and generates a structured presentation outline (including slide titles, content, and design hints).\n 2. The output from Claude will be in a structured format (like JSON) that we can parse.\n 3. We will then use PptxGenJS to create a PowerPoint presentation based on that structure.\n\n Important: We must have a robust prompt that guides Claude to produce consistent, well-structured output.\n\n Example of the desired Claude output format (JSON):\n\n {\n   \"title\": \"Presentation Title\",\n   \"slides\": [\n     {\n       \"title\": \"Slide 1 Title\",\n       \"content\": [\"Bullet point 1\", \"Bullet point 2\", ...],\n       \"design\": {\n         \"background\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n         \"color\": \"#000000\"\n       }\n     },\n     ...\n   ]\n }\n\n Alternatively, we can use Markdown or another structured format, but JSON is easier to parse.\n\n However, note that Claude (and many LLMs) can be more reliable when outputting in a markdown-like structure with clear delimiters. \n But since the requirement is for a JavaScript expert and we are using PptxGenJS, we can also consider having Claude output in a format that we can split by slides and then by content.\n\n Let's design a prompt that asks for a JSON output, but we must be cautious because sometimes the model might output non-JSON text. \n We can use a system prompt to enforce JSON output.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a function calling approach if available, but the project uses Claude and we are to generate a prompt.\n\n Considering the constraints, we will:\n\n - Create a function that sends a prompt to Claude (using the provided API) and expects a JSON response.\n - Parse the JSON and then generate the PowerPoint.\n\n We assume we have an environment set up with:\n   - Node.js\n   - PptxGenJS: npm install pptxgenjs\n   - API client for Claude (like @anthropic-ai/sdk)\n\n Let's break down the code:\n\n Step 1: Set up the Anthropic client (for Claude) and PptxGenJS.\n Step 2: Create a prompt that will guide Claude to generate the presentation structure in JSON.\n Step 3: Call Claude and get the response.\n Step 4: Parse the response (if it's a string of JSON, parse it).\n Step 5: Use PptxGenJS to create a presentation from the parsed JSON.\n\n We'll create a function `generatePresentation(topic)` that does all of this.\n\n Important: We must handle errors and edge cases (like Claude not returning valid JSON).\n\n Let's design the prompt:\n\n System Prompt:\n   \"You are a professional presentation designer. Your task is to generate a presentation outline in JSON format based on the user's topic. \n    The JSON should have a 'title' for the presentation and an array of 'slides'. Each slide should have:\n      - 'title': the slide title\n      - 'content': an array of strings (each string is a bullet point)\n      - 'design' (optional): an object with 'background' and 'color' for the slide (in hex format)\n\n    Example:\n      {\n        \\\"title\\\": \\\"The Future of AI\\\",\n        \\\"slides\\\": [\n          {\n            \\\"title\\\": \\\"Introduction\\\",\n            \\\"content\\\": [\\\"What is AI?\\\", \\\"History of AI\\\"],\n            \\\"design\\\": { \\\"background\\\": \\\"#FFFFFF\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"#000000\\\" }\n          },\n          ...\n        ]\n      }\n\n    Important: Only output the JSON. Do not output any other text.\"\n\n Then the user prompt would be the topic.\n\n However, note that the system prompt in Claude is done via the first message in the messages array? (Check the Anthropic API)\n\n Actually, the Anthropic API (for messages) uses a system prompt field. So we can set the system prompt as above.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We'll use the Anthropic SDK: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: We are not including the actual API key, so we assume it's set in the environment.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Install required packages: \n      npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk pptxgenjs\n\n 2. Create a file, e.g., `presentationGenerator.js`\n\n 3. Code:\n\n Let's write the code accordingly."

We'll focus on:\n\n 1. Prompt Engineering: Crafting a system prompt that reliably generates structured JSON for slides.\n 2. Claude Integration: Using the Anthropic SDK to get the slide content.\n 3. PowerPoint Generation: Using PptxGenJS to create the presentation from the JSON.\n\n We'll design the system with the following components:\n\n - PresentationGenerator: Main class that orchestrates the process.\n - PromptEngine: Handles the creation and refinement of the prompt.\n - ClaudeService: Handles communication with Claude.\n - PowerPointBuilder: Uses PptxGenJS to build the presentation.\n\n We'll also include error handling and logging.\n\n Let's break down the code accordingly.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. Set up the environment (dotenv for API key).\n 2. Create the PromptEngine to generate the system and user prompts.\n 3. Create the ClaudeService to send the prompt and parse the response.\n 4. Create the PowerPointBuilder to convert the structured data to a PPTX.\n 5. The PresentationGenerator class will use the above services.\n\n We'll also include a sample usage.\n\n Note: This code is for proprietary use, so we avoid exposing any internal details.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly."

Apify template for selling on Apify.com\n\n Steps for Self-Hosted Version:\n   - We'll create a Node.js server that serves the HTML/JS/CSS for the frontend and has an API endpoint to generate the presentation using Claude.\n   - We'll use Express.js for the server and integrate the Anthropic SDK.\n\n Steps for Apify Template:\n   - We'll create an Apify actor that uses Puppeteer or plain HTTP requests to interact with Claude API and generate the PPTX.\n   - The actor will accept input (topic, audience, etc.) and output the generated PowerPoint file.\n\n Let's start with the self-hosted version:\n\n Self-Hosted Version Structure:\n   - Frontend: The HTML/CSS/JS we created (with minor adjustments to use the backend API)\n   - Backend: Express server with two routes:\n        POST /api/generate: To generate the presentation content using Claude\n        POST /api/export: To generate the PPTX file (optional, we can do it on frontend with PptxGenJS)\n\n However, note that the Claude API key should not be exposed on the frontend. So we'll do:\n        Frontend sends the user input to our backend, backend sends to Claude, gets the response, and sends back the structured data.\n\n Implementation:\n\n Step 1: Create a Node.js project and install dependencies.\n\n Step 2: Set up the Express server.\n\n Step 3: Create the frontend to use the backend API.\n\n We'll adjust the frontend to call our own API when generating.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n Due to the complexity, I'll break it into two parts: server and client.\n\n Server Code (index.js):"
