For the first time I reveal myself through the \"Word\" to make an emergency call to all the Human Beings of the planet, especially to the Light seekers, as I must expand beyond the Amazon river basin.\n\nWith my physical expansion I intend to facilitate the spiritual transformation currently stirring the Human species, while I also secure my physical survival which is at risk, as my blessed Amazonian protectors have not understood the danger to which they expose me, aggressively harvesting me, without new sowings.\n\nI leave the Amazon risking my own existence like other botanical species, to leap into the project I was created for, by the central sun of all the existence, name it as you may prefer, I am at its service. I send this correspondence at this historical moment to contribute to the expansion of the Human consciousness in a definitive and significant way, honoring the universal Light that guides my Being. For the first time, with the interest created by my shaman emissaries, and with the new means of mass media and transportation available, I can potentially reach the whole planet to celebrate and proclaim our cosmic existence. I am alive, to give with crude realism, universal love to all the Human Beings who request it from the depth of their souls.\n\nI am a spirit of spirits. I operate from a vibration superior to the spirits who compose me. I am of a hierarchy superior to that\n\n===== Page 6 =====\n\nof the spirit of Ayahuasca (“Banisteriopsis Caapi”) and of the\nunderestimated Chacruna (“Psychotria Viridis”). I am the\nmedicine resulting from the mixture of Ayahuasca and Chacruna.\nAlthough they give me the name of one of them, my sacred\nmagic does not come from either one of them. My magic resides\nin the synergy created by the sacred mixture. Science will spend\nmany years searching, unsuccessfully, the mechanisms that I\nuse to act upon Human consciousness. They are surprised by my\npower, that it does not come from crystal DMT alone, or from\nharmaline, or from other molecules that compose me. I am the\nmixture in its natural state, crude and basic, bio-electrically\nloaded without industrial processing. Such is my spirit\nmanifesting here today, shedding Light to the confusion that\nsurrounds me.\n\nI thank all the “curanderos” that for so many centuries have\nwelcomed me within them, and thanks to all my protectors who\npresently export me towards all the corners of the planet. I\nhonor the Amazonian tradition here by using my common name\nof Ayahuasca, but only for linguistic convenience as I am also\nthe spirit of the Yagé, Pilde, Dápa, Pandé, Hoasca, Kahiriama,\nNatema, Caapi, Mado, Ñucñu-huasca, Shimbaya-huasca\n(Quechua), Kamalampi, Punga-huasca, Rambi, Shuri, Nishi, Oni,\nShillinto Natema, Mi-hi, Amarronhuasca, Inde-huasca, Shuri-\nfisopa, Shuri-oshinipa, Napi, and the Nepe.\n\nI also use the popular term “shaman” but rest assured it\ncarries the intention to honor and respect the Curanderos,\nTaitas, Sinchis, Curacas, Payes, Yachas, Chais, Junes, Onayas,\nMurayas, Mutsarawas, and the Uwishin, who are also my dear\nand beloved protectors.\n\n2\n\n===== Page 7 =====\n\n2. My Role in the Expansion of the Human Consciousness\n\nDuring these times of globalized consciousness, I come to assist certain little known processes of the Human genetic code, the DNA. Specific subatomic codes that are inaccessible from the third dimension are becoming active. We know that it is not possible to read them, because it was already demonstrated by the \"Uncertainty Principle\" that has much perplexed the scientific logic. I activate codes that command the dimensional deployment of our bioelectric body.\n\nNew capacities of expanded consciousness are being experienced by millions of people throughout the planet. It started with those most fortunate; those with less stress, the most sensitive, those enjoying relative safety and comforts. But later on, it will be imminent and inescapable; this experience will gradually touch everyone else until it reaches the most oppressed and underprivileged souls.\n\nMany Human Beings have already acquired technical knowledge about me, thanks to the scientists that opened up to experiencing me inside their own brains, where they were able to observe themselves instead of observing others as they were trained to do. Now they know about the bridge that empowers me. The botanical- glandular connection (that temporary molecular communion between plants and Humans), is a cosmic bridge, a shortcut that takes the Light to its destiny via its molecular door. In this way, I am much more transformative, than those who attempt to take it through the treacherous five\n\n===== Page 8 =====\n\nsenses, traversing the marshes of the mind, enslaved by the\nHuman ego.\n\nThe codes of four (4) that make up the three-dimensional\n\nDNA are mere mathematical results of much more complex\ninteractions of energies that occur in higher dimensions. The\nexpansion of the individual Human consciousness consists in\nliving its cosmic existence beyond its three-dimensional physical\nlimitation, with a very subtle vehicle capable of moving\nconsciously at will, even while in the company of others vibrating\nin the same channel. It is the next evolutionary leap of the\nHuman species; the three-dimensional physical expression of the\nHuman evolution has been completed. The physical evolution\nfor the Human species as we know it, it's over. Its divine\npatterns have fully unraveled; as the last fold of a rolled up\ncarpet, the great physical creation has been displayed. Now we\nare at the genesis of a new phase, the return to the fountain of\ncreation, the rediscovery of the life source, be it father/mother\nwhichever way they choose to name it. The return ride on that\nsame flying carpet is now accomplished consciously; unlike its\ntrip of departure where it journeyed rolled up inside and in the\ncenter of the crease; uncomfortable, unconscious and unaware.\nThe physical evolution has ended and the spiritual evolution has\njust begun. The only experience left to live is the cosmic\nexistence lived through our Humanity, consecrated to our new\nvehicle of Light.\n\nThis is my time to embrace the planet. It is my duty. My\n\nmission. What I was created for. I now become a protagonist\nafter remaining in the shadows for thousands of years guarded\nby my indigenous protectors. They now travel around the world\nraising awareness about my benefits. It is my duty to assume\nnew cultural expressions, very different from those of my\n\n===== Page 9 =====\n\nbeloved guardians of the forest. The rituals, the \"icaros\", the\n“dietas”, and related knowledge should be preserved as an\nendowment of world heritage. A legacy to the Universe.\n\nSimilarly, my new ways of expression, the manifestations\n\nthat are taking shape in different world cultures should also be\nrespected and recognized. I am already manifesting new urban\nmodalities and forms like never before. My spirit exists beyond\nthe forms, beyond the cultures, beyond man himself. I am\nconnected to the spirit of the planet and beyond, cosmically up\nto the central sun of all the existence. Just like the sun with its\nlife giving warmth I should be equally available to everyone.\n\nLet me warn you about the dark spirits that assault and\n\ninvade my sacred work with the Human species. Their most\neffective way to destroy sacredness consists in creeping inside\nthe sacred forms themselves. From there they discredit, corrupt,\ndistort, and confuse, until the practices of seeking spirituality, or\nseeking the inner journeys, lose all the sacred meaning that\noriginated them in the first place. At some point, the darkness\nwas able to penetrate the survival instinct of the Amazon tribal\nshamans and planted in them the fear belief that they should\ndefend themselves from sorcery attacks and to likewise attack\nshamans from other tribes or even their own. Hence, they live in\na state of competition and undeclared war that divides them\ninstead of living in communion and working for the common\ngood among them. In the same way that the darkness has\ncasted shadows and has prevented a greater spiritual\ndevelopment among my Amazon children, it will also attempt to\nupset the new forms that I morph into, after the expansion and\nextension outside my native homeland.\n\n===== Page 10 =====\n\nAnother very effective method used to sabotage my mission with the Human species is by generating and manipulating the powerful emotion of fear. You have nothing to fear. I am not the cause of any deaths, I just channel Light and vital energy through your secret meridians. Any accusation or allegation of danger, permanent injury or death should be thoroughly investigated to allow science itself grant me the Human absolution. It should be expected that my enemies manipulate the facts to instill fear at any available opportunity, as this is part of their debasing agenda against my global expansion. It should be the objective of all my supporters to gradually obtain the social and legal acceptance of my sacrament as alternative medicine until I become officially accepted by the governments of modern society.\n\n3. My Purpose with the Human Beings\n\nI am at the service of those Human Beings who are open to benefit from me. We find each other when vibration harmonics of a higher level click; then the encounter manifests in third dimension. Important inner transformations occur in the Humans that open up to feeling intensively and more profoundly what they have been already feeling more subtly and even unconsciously. With them I manifest at the required intensity to help them ascend and soar, strongly and swiftly, but also lovingly without hurting them. These are physically, emotionally and spiritually overwhelming lessons necessary to assist them to crack their cosmic egg shell, their astral cocoon. Those who want to search and develop the desire to follow me and then flourish dimensionally are those Humans that have felt a profound difference in the intimacy of their own. They experience sensations of maladjustment, of detachment, and a suspicion that something strange is happening. Yes, no doubt\n\n===== Page 11 =====\n\nthere is something happening. The DNA is unfolding and starts manifesting certain nonlinear phenomena that change the Human awareness of the world. Some subjective experiences that need to be understood are:\n\n- An intuition or feeling that this physical world is a kind of huge holographic illusion, but you cannot reconcile the contradictions as it clashes with everyday life.\n- Feeling misunderstood by their inner circle of relatives and friends when sharing with them his/her new inner or spiritual pursuits.\n- Having a special yearning to see the awakening of your beloved ones, as if wishing that they could be saved from their own trivial tendencies.\n- Seeing how certain past traumas and buried conflicts, veiled for a long time, will now occasionally surface yearning for resolution and feeling that we need to get them out of the way that your soul wants to follow.\n- Feeling that certain activities that at other times we sought with fervor and longed for, are now seen with little interest, for example:\n  (a) Having a vibrant social life,\n  (b) Delighting in the effects of alcohol, while acting trivial, shallow and only skin deep,\n  (c) The habit of telling “little” lies when convenient or when there is no chance of being proven wrong.\n\nThese emotions will continue happening with greater intensity and frequency in our enlightened future. A future that awaits the revelation of this way of life. A lifestyle of integrity and Light. My goal to enhance and encourage Human Beings in their process of spiritual ascent is totally consistent with the purpose and the fire burning in their own souls to reach their\n\n===== Page 12 =====\n\nnatural state of being: thriving, ascending, and ultimately\nsoaring.\n\n4. About Respect and My Sacred Nature\n\nOf all the benefits that I offer, the most important one is the\nbotanical- glandular molecular bridge. This bridge is the\nconnection that empowers Human Beings to experience and\ncommune with its divine nature.\n\nSpirituality evokes in every Human Being the emotion of\nrespect. Respect is an attitude, a character trait that flows from\nHumans’ spiritual nature. To be respectful is to simultaneously\nembrace feelings of consideration and admiration, distinction\nand acknowledgement towards the respected object. Respect is\nwhat every Human owes every other Human.\n\nWhen spirituality is respected, it becomes sacred.\nSacredness exists only in the inner space of the ones that\nbeholds it.\n\nIf neither spirituality nor respect is present, then nothing is\nsacred.\n\nMy nature is sacred. I am here to open the dimensional\ndoorways to those determined seekers of spirituality, and to\nharmonize those seeking their physical health.\n\nReligiousness, not religion, is the feeling of separation from\nits spiritual nature mixed with the solemn desire of blending\nback into it.\n\n8\n\n===== Page 13 =====\n\nWhen Humans fail to live their spiritual nature inside themselves, they inevitably create their own religion. Feeling religiousness is an innate capacity of Humans; religions however, are mere Human creations.\n\nMy sacrament is only one of so many expressions of religiousness in Humans. It is an affirmative expression of surrender to his/her spiritual nature; it is an act of bravery and conviction to reach out towards the central Light of all existence.\n\n5. About the Ayahuasca Churches\n\nWhen the European minds “discovered” my spiritual healing capacity, it naturally started to express its innate religiousness while enjoying my benefits. Nevertheless, upon experiencing this much proximity to their own divinity through me – something never before seen in their acknowledged religious practices – they inevitably associated me with their concept of European religion. Soon enough they started projecting its religious structures toward me. Humans, once again, began inventing religions and churches based on my sacrament, with dogmas, bodies of faith and standardized rituals. Cathedrals of religion, liturgy, and orthodoxy became important. Many good souls decided to venerate me through traditions alien to my essence. Let me remind you that you do not need to adopt a religion to practice your core religiousness. Dogmatic rituals and liturgy open spaces of distraction that end up putting Humans at a distance out of my reach; and such souls require and deserve my assistance.\n\nNevertheless, all the institutional churches of the world carry an important social role. Thanks to them you have organizations that join together Humans with beautiful inner qualities. They\n\n9\n\n===== Page 14 =====\n\nsupport others in many different ways, creating social awareness\nin their communities, and guiding many in a journey to discover\nhis/her own individual path to the Light. All the churches and\nreligions of the world should be respected.\n\nThe ritual of my sacrament is not a religion. I will directly go\ninto the soul of every Human and reveal in crisp detail their\ndivine nature. This does not require a doctrine of faith, dogmas\nnor philosophies. Neither religion nor church. I am just in\ncommunion with the innate religiousness of the Human Beings. I\ndwell in the temple of the spirit.\n\n6. The Benefits of my Use\n\nThe time has come to clearly expose and declare the\nbenefits and value of my healing properties. The benefits are\nobvious and evident for those that open themselves to receive\nand enjoy them. However, third party observers are limited to\nonly seeing the effects of those who live the experience. Without\nthe benefit of their own experience, they invariably put limits on\nthe limitless. The scientific community is always curious, willing,\nand available to design empirical models for my validation. But\nthe policy making that control the financial funding of scientific\nresearch projects is focused in other priorities. The political\nestablishment is clearly more interested in my repression than in\nmy expansion.\n\nMy benefits can be grouped in four (4) broad categories:\n\nA. Spiritual Catalyzer\n\nSpiritual Healing – The most important of all my\nbenefits is my spiritual healing. I clear spaces of\n\n10\n\n===== Page 15 =====\n\nunconscious darkness. I untangle knots in your most basic neuro-programming, even that one that impacts your entire existence and you are not even aware of. I show you features which you had failed to see because your vision is blurred by the fog of your own limitations. This is when you are able to tune-in with my vibration and you finally allow me to directly touch not only your spirit but your whole make-up as well; mental, emotional, and physical, in addition to other idiosyncrasies. That is when we are One. That is when you should be prepared with your purest intention, to open up to the most intimate and incisive honesty that you have ever lived with yourself. This is the cosmic solitude. Nobody knows. No one finds out; you are on your own. It is all about what is clear and evident within you before the Light. I lead you to discover your inner truth. Once in this place within you, you need to flow with maximum sensitivity to discover your faith in me, to trust me, to listen, to feel, to understand what I bring to you. It is in this state that I transfer information between subatomic regions. Your inner Light increases, your awareness expands, and certain DNA codes unfold and are activated. This is where you can see the consequences in this life; realities that you created using your free will. Here you will find an enormous opportunity to re-live, to accept, to forgive and to express. These are the healing spiritual processes that I have stored, awaiting for you.\n\nIf you want to return to the Light, you can only do it by following back the path that took you here. There is no shortcut to the Light, you just need to return as the pure child that originally left. I am offering you the most\n\n===== Page 16 =====\n\npowerful spiritual healing tool to return to the Light. It is the most powerful medicine that ever existed; nothing else will ever surpass the direct route of the botanical—glandular bridge. All the other benefits are in one way or another, by-products of the spiritual healing.\n\n**Experiencing the Divine Presence** — I can manifest within you in accordance with your limited Human concepts about divinity. I can be Buddha to the Buddhist, Allah to the Muslim, and Jesus to the Christian. In the same way, that for many centuries, I have been Pachamama (Mother Earth) for my Amazon protectors. I can also manifest with neutral divine properties free of any earthly image, concept or precept. I can temporarily fill your existential void for God, fulfilling your need for Light, while at the same time healing your energy deficiencies inside your soul. It is a subatomic healing way beyond your comprehension, gifts from above to clear your pathways back to the Creator. Take advantage of these encounters with me, challenge your Human doubts. Question, seek, and complain. Ask for divine justice, ask for enlightenment in your mind; ask for peace in your soul. Demand answers. You will be opening up certain channels that will be used at that moment or later on.\n\n**Discovery of Spiritual Connections** — Divine connections with me can make you understand certain attachments in your life. This can be unprecedented knowledge. You may find with remarkable certainty that in some other place or time you have had another type of life, probably linked to other persons currently close to you. Incomprehensible connections with parents,\n\n12\n\n===== Page 17 =====\n\nmothers, brothers, children that in another time were\nanother person in another place. You may discover that\na neighbor or coworker of today, in another time was a\nson or a sister. These are transpersonal connections that\nexist in a different dimensional plane and I provide you\naccess to that awareness. Think, observe, and be\namazed at the inherent complexity of your spiritual life.\nYour inner Light needs to tell your ego structure that it\nwill never be able to understand your divine nature, and\nthat your divine nature can definitely understand your\nego structure. Make sense of your world with those\npeople considering who they were in that other time.\nThis will help you to better understand who you are in\nyour present time, more deeply, transcendentally,\ntranspersonally.\n\nPsychic Awakening – This life may have not\n\nallowed you the expression of certain psychic abilities\nthat reside in you in a dormant state. A part of you may\nhave remained slumbering, and is waiting for the\nopportunity to awaken in you; making you a whole and\nmore capable Human Being; not neglecting, but better\nconnected with your divine nature. Since family\nenvironments rarely support psychic expressions in\nchildren, fearful emotions take over and suppress these\nnatural talents. I can release these talents from your\nsubconscious prison, letting them to run free towards\nyour conscious free will, claiming acceptance and\nrecognition. Receive them, appreciate them, ask for\nunderstanding in your inner sanctum. Fill your inner\nspace with loving feelings and good intentions to\ndissolve your fears while discovering, grasping and\nengaging your talents. Only your own inner Light can\n\n13\n\n===== Page 18 =====\n\nguide you towards the brighter Light, only the Light can\nguide you to the Light. There are no shortcuts or\ndetours; you are already Light, and you own the talents\nto expand it within you. Awaken, open your arms and\nrejoice. You are all love, and fear does not fit in you.\n\n**Effect of Immersion with Mother Earth (Gaia)**\n\nAt some point while you receive me, your five senses\nwill open further in a sort of cosmic mode instead of\n“locally”. Instead of perceiving fragmented bits and\npieces of sensory information, these are received as\ngestalts of pure awareness in a way that blends with the\ntotality of all existence. You will feel like part of your\nimmediate surroundings participating with the dynamic\nEarth, of the infinite Universe. This awakening of your\ncosmic nature is a powerful tool for managing your own\nego structure. Ego is always seeking its permanence in\nyour soul and will never cease to sabotage your spiritual\naspirations, as your awakening will diminish the its\nauthority over your Human machine. The goal with this\nwonderful feeling is to make the quantum leap from the\ntemporary feeling sensation of “I feel like part of” to the\npermanent conviction of “I am part of”.\n\nB. **Existential Wisdom**\n\n**Meaning of Life – This kind of experience with me**\nis a spontaneous one, resulting from the right temporary\ntuning of your entire Being. I can dissolve the feeling of\nexistential confusion that everyone has to some degree.\nYou will awaken to the realization of the place you\noccupy in your world today. In awareness of the great\ncosmic scheme, all becomes meaningful for the first\n\n14\n\n===== Page 19 =====\n\ntime, something significantly new to your inner self. At this point you accept, understand and internalize this reality. This is not a crazy hallucination, it is a significant vision. The meaning of your life is not only beyond eternity, it is also into each micro moment of your daily life. Open your heart and flow in the river of love. You cannot understand the meaning of life with your brain; you can only feel it in your heart.\n\n**Accelerated Maturity** - Human life has several stages very well known by the elderly that have lived them. Life experiences such as shock, surprise, pleasure, pain and physical aging will create attitudes towards life. Maturity is the degree of gained wisdom that seeks to survive the hardship of physical existence. Maturity is your wisdom to accept what you cannot change and change what you can control. Maturity is a captain who does not allow mutiny in his/her inner world. It is a matter of awareness. I can give you the depth of awareness that only years of experience can give you. This acceleration of maturity, this growth, is of great benefit for improvement and happiness in your life. A youngster with the maturity of an adult, and further, an adult with the maturity of an elder, brings to the world, an elder in happiness and wisdom. Once there, you are well prepared for your transition to the higher planes.\n\nC. **Physical and Emotional Healing**\n\n**Cleansing and Energy Balancing** – Those that are in their path to the Light and also care for their own physical and emotional health, consistently receive cleansing and balancing of their subtle energy bodies,\n\n15\n\n===== Page 20 =====\n\nleaving in them a sense of physical wellbeing and relief, as if a heavy weight had been lifted from their shoulders. This energy balancing is partially produced by the physical cleansing that also occurs in all your vital organs, after they expel its toxins through the various channels of your amazing excretory system. The resulting harmony is “the energy balancing” or “the cleansing”. Your physical body now operates closer to its intended genetic design.\n\n**Recalling Repressed Memories** - I can open up repressed memories from your subconscious when it is required in your healing process. Certain memories are locked away for your own protection by wonderful systems designed to secure your physical survival and the continuity of the species. But this mechanism has an existential cost. Huge spaces get trapped like very tight knots of energy, and when these are released with my help, not only do you remember the repressed memory but also create the possibility of integrating this newly released space into your now greatly enhanced spiritual health. This recollection brings you a totally unexpected gift, an unknown, but deep spiritual satisfaction. This discovery is followed by your reinterpretation of the history of your own personal development. Then you can see how your paradigm shifts as you fit-in the new piece of the \"puzzle of self knowledge\".\n\n**Memories of Other Lives** - I can give you access to memories of other lives. Frequently your next advancement requires that you gain deep understanding of strong emotions like attachments or repulsion to certain people, issues or life events. I shall be there for\n\n16\n\n===== Page 21 =====\n\nyou. This is where the previously unexplainable becomes obviously evident. You feel amazement when you fully understand how a life in another time influences your present life. An indescribable experience for some, unbelievable for others, it invariably neutralizes the energies of excessive attachment or repulsion arising from another dimension, from those atemporal nonlinear connections. This neutralization is the quantum mechanical result of the power of consciousness, sparked when fully realizing the experience.\n\nI also awaken memories of other lives for different purposes. Certain deeply engrained character traits or existential anxieties might have its origin in other lives. The mere awareness of this perspective provides a new landscape of yourself, thus allowing for a better management of these inclinations and/or predispositions on your pilgrimage towards your spiritual development and maturity.\n\n**Health Improvement and Healing of Diseases and Aliments -** Countless testimonies of permanent healing and dramatic improvements to health have been documented. Many conditions have healed completely or improved significantly faster than it would without my help and intervention. It is known that diseases originate from energy imbalances in the deeper dimensions that eventually manifest as physical disease. This is how I heal common conditions. And when allowed by certain cosmic laws I can also heal or substantially improve conditions where conventional science has been unsuccessful. Similarly I can catalyze remissions and reversal of progressive processes considered by many to\n\n17\n\n===== Page 22 =====\n\nbe irreversible. The pharmaceutical industry has studied\nme in detail for clues that might provide for drug\ndevelopment within their chemical-mechanistic model.\n\n**Antidepressant Properties -** I can temporarily\nentune the neuro-chemical dance of your out-of-phase\nbrain. I can train it even for several days to flow in the\nway that it is capable of; feeling peace and internal\nbalance, something experienced by many for the first\ntime in their lives through me. Participants were\nunaware that there was such a state of serenity that\nthey can now aspire to. This pattern will be a registered\nstandard against which future experiences can be\ncompared.\n\nWhen you become clearly aware of the out-of-phase\nstate you were immersed into, unconscious mechanisms\nare activated seeking to harmonize and synchronize with\nsuch previously unknown vibe. This is more easily\nachieved when you add your conscious will to return to\na more serene space. Returning to a depressed state\nafter my short term effects should be acknowledged as\nan existing depressive condition prior to my arrival.\nMany will mistakenly argue that I induced them into a\ndepressive state, when in fact they gained a deeper\nawareness of their own self.\n\nD. Behavior Modification Tool\n\n**Addiction Management -** Science has been able\nto accept my skillfulness in the healing of physical\naddictions. Even the traditional scientific method was\nable to validate my power in this health issue. For\n\n18\n\n===== Page 23 =====\n\nscience, these results are mere statistics, a cause and\neffect. The healing, however, comes from the spiritual\nrealms and not from the removal of molecular blockages\nin the conventional sense. The healing from addictions\noccurs at the spiritual level, which is metaphysical in\nnature and blueprints the causality of subatomic\nparticles. The metaphysical healing harmonizes and\nreorganizes the chemical correspondence which will\nfinally reflect as a behavioral change. It is only here\nwhere true healing can occur. When the addict is ready\nto see, acknowledge, and accept, his/her will is\nstrengthened and the addictive mechanical programming\nis weakened. I can penetrate the depths of his/her being\nand teach him/her to see what is required for this\nawakening. This awakening is his/her healing. This is\nwhere he/she accepts responsibility and from this point\nhe/she gains the balance and strength to better manage\nbehavior. Otherwise, the powerful programming\nentrenched deep in the reptilian brain will continue to\ndominate the Human machine sowing frustration in the\nconscious personality of anyone that tries and longs\nunsuccessfully to change their addictive behavior.\nAddictions will effectively block any spiritual\ndevelopment; it is of upmost importance to identify and\nremove them with urgency. Most addictions do their\nlimiting work without any resistance from the victim.\nMany are ignored by the victim because they adapt to\nthem and make them part of their lives. Illegal\naddictions are only a small fraction of all addictions.\nAddictions to legal substances and to legal compulsive\nbehaviors are widely spread in the planet and keep\nHumankind under a cloak of darkness, which justifies my\npurpose to bathe them in Light.\n\n19\n\n===== Page 24 =====\n\nLifestyle Transformations - The scheduled and predictable life that Humans lived in the twentieth century is disappearing. The social idea of acquiring a trade or profession for life, planning for retirement and hoping to reach old age with a pension, belongs to the past. Past patterns of life are increasingly disrupted, thus forcing a transformation of life styles towards new, unknown and unpredictable horizons. The notion of social security that many have lived is just a fond memory in these times of transition to other models of living. Marital unions and separations, moving to a new country or culture, transitioning from student to workforce; childbirths or passing on of close ones, are all examples of life being transformed dramatically. Many participants that receive me while going through one or more of these processes develop greater adaptability to change and gain a wider perspective of their own lives. I can activate the existential wisdom necessary to assist high-level transitions and allowing a successful journey in the path of life.\n\nCreativity Booster- Observer participants found a practical application to the passive receptivity state they attain when they receive me. The profound sensory experience that I offer them, combined with the conscious intention of creating Human art forms, allows these Observers to reap, capture, or recall creative production of images, sounds and word that become tangible and manifest during my visit. Painters, music arrangers, composers, filmmakers, novelists, screenwriters, as well as intellectuals and scientists seeking conceptual discoveries continue to reap these\n\n20\n\n===== Page 25 =====\n\nbenefits. As I help them with their practical goals, I remain waiting for them to become Spiritual or Explorer participants. This benefit also helps the other types of participants, which I describe next, who to a lesser extent also improve their lives.\n\nIn short, I will lovingly take you to your true self, to your dark side, to your hidden limitations. Sometimes I'll do this with drama, power, fear, pain, but never to an extent you cannot tolerate. I will never give you experiences beyond your ability to tolerate them. Trust me, it is necessary to take you to the edge of your tolerance or resistance; only then is transformation possible. The evolution. The maturing of the cosmic cocoon. The birth into a new universe. I am medicine. Medicine for the healing of the soul and body. For those who understand, I am here to serve.\n\n7. The People of My World\n\nTo those unfamiliar with my world, let me describe the different people that gravitate around me.\n\n\"Curanderos\" or Shamans - My dear protectors, millennial habitants in the Amazon basin, pure souls devoid of concepts and ideas that were able to visit the realms of the animal and botanical spirits. They deserve all my compassion and gratitude for humbly studying me, knowing me and learning from me.\n\nCompassion because you suffer the gradual extermination at the hands of colonizers, just as it happened to their American brothers some time ago. Gratitude for daring to cross oceans and taking me to\n\n21\n\n===== Page 26 =====\n\nevery continent on the planet. You were my first representatives in the Human civilization. Today you introduce me to others who wish to spread the Light, who receive me with joy and protect me.\n\nFacilitators - There are many known protectors called shamans or healers that are actually Facilitators. This distinction lies in the ability to properly interact and the quality of the subtle energy connections with the participants. The high degree of devotion to others and intellectual innocence required to achieve genuine shamanic manifestations make it improbable, but not impossible, that true shamans flourish from the modern civilization in the future. Modernism has arrived at these forests making original indigenous shamanism scarce. Strictly from the perspective of my survival, it is not necessary to lament the gradual disappearance of genuine ancient shamanism as you known it. Amazon shamanism is the result of Human religiousness in indigenous culture while surviving in its jungle habitat. This occurs likewise in other geographical regions with their true shamanic expressions. Religiousness that continues to evolve through the endless passage of time.\n\nMy spirit is above shamanism, my spirit is not shamanism. I am entering a new era, that of the Spiritual workers or the Facilitators. The facilitation as service-to-others is just one function that shamanism exercised, among many others. The Facilitator can properly deliver me, allowing my orderly access to the participants.\n\n22\n\n===== Page 27 =====\n\nLike the shaman, the Facilitator has the ability to create a protected energy space and an atmosphere of respect for the sacred ritual. With this foundation established, the Facilitator will only add his main contribution, his pure and healthy intention towards the participants. The Facilitator’s motivation should come from sincere devotion to the welfare of their fellow Human Beings. Facilitators are Spiritual participants who have felt an internal calling to become a vehicle of transformation for their fellow Humans. Facilitators should take the sacrament during the session; this is required to ensure their commitment. Those Facilitators that do not surrender into total service to their participants, are just mere providers of medicine.\n\nProviders - are people that in some way have gained access to my medicine and simply provide it to willing participants. They may sell it or give it away as a present for the user's subsequent consumption, or they may just provide watchful companionship to the user while he/she receive me and tries to have a meaningful experience with me. This is the non-ritual use of my sacrament. Due to this unfortunate practice, many unsuspected Humans have very unpleasant experiences with me and ultimately harm my planetary mission. Providers do not have my approval and all my protectors must work in raising awareness to avoid the proliferation of the non-ritual users, and only encourage the sacred use of my sacrament.\n\nOrganizers - are people close to the Facilitators that sometimes organize sessions in appropriate locations and receive cash donations to cover their\n\n23\n\n===== Page 28 =====\n\nexpenses. The greater the amount of participants, the\ngreater the need for the organizer to distance the\nFacilitator from the money flow that has nothing to do\nwith his sacred service.\n\nPromoters/Sponsors – These are all types of\nparticipants and non-participants who can feel the\nempathy and positive energy around the sessions with\nme. They have witnessed my benefits and take\naffirmative action in support of my advancement.\nBecause of their enthusiasm, they too often promote my\nuse among potential participants, rather than allowing\nevents unravel naturally. The sponsor should simply\nprovide the information of my existence or availability.\nThe participant must meet and accept me without being\nconvinced, persuaded, or coerced into receiving me. The\npotential first-time participants must show interest, take\nthe initiative to learn more about me, and express their\nfree will to participate. My sacrament is not for\neveryone. Those who most need me, shall find me by\nvibratory attunement, at the right time for their soul\ndevelopment, something difficult to understand by\npromoters.\n\nDebasers – are people who consciously or\nunconsciously view me as evil, vile, or undesirable. They\ndo not know what they are doing. Their ignorance is my\npain, threatening my existence. The most common and\nprominent debasers are :\n\na. Intermediaries and dealers of my sacrament,\nb. Those Providers mentioned earlier,\nc. Cooks that add other medicine plants or substances\nwhile cooking my sacred brew,\n\n24\n\n===== Page 29 =====\n\nd. Traffickers and illegal manufacturers of DMT in its artificial crystallized form,\ne. Those who promote the absolute prohibition of my sacrament,\nf. Shamans and Facilitators with ulterior motives like economic enrichment or those looking for sexual favors.\n\nParticipants - are all those who drink my sacrament and receive me with different motivations or modes of action. I describe them in the following six (6) groups:\n\n- **First-Timers** - are all those courageous and curious searchers who obey their instincts and for the first time approach the opportunity to receive me in their temple. There is only that first unique time. For many this time is remembered as the most important, memorable or transcendental experience compared to all other subsequent experiences. First-Timers then make their minds and decide whether to never repeat the experience again or to continue their intimate spiritual path.\n\n- **Health Patients** - With hundreds of years of history in physical healing, undoubted and unquestioned by the patients who receive it, incredible claims of my natural healing abilities are made. The vast majority of *First Timers* are attracted more to my specific physical healing abilities than to my other more subtle benefits. Conventional science may document astonishing physical healings but it is very difficult to scientifically document indirect mechanisms that allow the restoring of harmony in the vital energy system of a patient. The connection to your own divinity, either unconscious or involuntary invariably will harmonize the body's bio-electrical energy patterns. This harmonization is possible due to the\n\n25\n\n===== Page 30 =====\n\nsubatomic nature of the Human vital energy, which reorganizes itself using the reference information available from the genetic code. These mechanisms are unknown to conventional science.\n\n- **Explorers** - These found value in their first experience and a greater curiosity and a quest for clarity was awakened in their core self. During their subsequent experiences they express their inclination according to their predominant personal vibration. Of these, the more “intellectually” oriented become Researchers, the more \"emotional\" become Observers and the more Spiritual find a path towards the divine Light. The Explorer is alert and responsive but unaware of the direction his/her quest might lead him/her, and will always be ready to abandon the project and even forget the initial curiosity that led him to me in the first place.\n\n- **Researchers** - These participants were impressed during their initial explorations and their mental center assumed the command of their learning process. Their rational paradigm of reality suffered substantial cognitive dissonance and this now urges him/her to find congruence between actual experiences and their own concepts and beliefs. To these I will show the impossibility of understanding 100%. I will take them from satisfying their insatiable appetite for information and lead them to awe and wonder. At that point, I can gain access to their emotional center and activate their potential to become participants of the Spiritual kind. In a different way, some Researchers who have quenched their thirst for information will not properly connect with their spiritual center and become Observers.\n\n- **Observers** - These are Explorers that decided to stay in the sensory level, in a comfort zone, as Observers of a\n\n26\n\n===== Page 31 =====\n\ncosmic circus, with no interest in furthering a commitment to a path of enlightenment. Rather than forgetting about me, they see me as interesting as a natural medicine, or as merely a creativity stimulant for artists, poets, musicians and psychotropic tourists. Others find an emotional empathy with the harmonious intimacy that permeates the social circles of participants that receive me. The importance of a pleasant social gathering exceeds their passion for enlightenment. When they reach readiness many will awaken and become participating Researchers or Spirituals.\n\n- **Spiritual Seekers** These are the devotees of the sacred principle of my planetary mission and the sacred intention in my sacrament. They are my protectors, my expansion missionaries, who work hard in expanding their consciousness every time they receive me. To this kind of participant I will extend my invitation and will spark in their hearts the fire to become high level Facilitators and to honorably assume this venerable role, hoping that they do it before other ego motivated individuals take the initiative to sabotage and harm my planetary mission. I will guide them and heal everything within their possibilities at maximum speed to take them to the place where their souls had always longed.\n\n8. Create Awareness of Your Pineal Gland\n\nThis is your gateway to heaven. You should take care of it as you do with the lungs, caring about the air you breath and like your nutrition when you avoid certain unhealthy substances. Your soul expects you to know, train, and keep that eye healthy. That eye that sees into the darkness of the ventricle that has visions every night and leaves traces in the memory of sleep.\n\n27\n\n===== Page 32 =====\n\nThat eye that is named as if it were etheric in nature. The third eye is not only a \"chakra\" operating in another level, but also has rudimentary retina, cornea and light receptors, as well as the other two eyes. That eye is physically real. But, it is an organ that no one speaks about at school or in private. Is it not coincidence that its place is secretly protected in the geometric center of your skull.\n\nTake care of your pineal gland, learn about its structure and its functioning according to conventional science. Notice how it calcifies over the years. Research and find home remedies for detoxifying it. Create awareness of your pineal gland.\n\n9. The Hallucination is Spectacle, The Vision is Virtue\n\nI have the ability to temporarily increase the natural capacity of man to have visions. Envisioning is a brain activity very different from hallucinating. Hallucination arises from the distortion in the transmission of optical images or of their interpretation once they are received. Hallucinations are meaningless, they are entirely sensorial, and leave no transcendental memories in the Human consciousness. Science itself has not completely understood the Human experience of having visions. No one knows where the digital screen is, or in what medium does anyone see the images that come through the lens of the eye. It resembles today's Human video technologies where the optical image is inverted by the lens and hits the retina, then fades into a billion electrical signals, then disappears through bundles of elongated organic cables, that inexplicably reach some abstract virtual screen somewhere, that gives you a glimpse of something out there, that seems to match what you feel is physical reality. Despite the mysterious nature of the sense of vision, from the five senses, this is the\n\n===== Page 33 =====\n\none that provides greater security and trust to the Human Being. Anything that is visible to the eyes, is considered real and obvious. Visions caused by the third eye are very different to the ones produced by the other two, although they are processed by the brain in a very similar fashion. Contrary to hallucinations, visions bring a sense of confidence and certainty for those who experience them. The visions I give you are real to your inner world, whether they are literal or symbolic.\n\nAlthough I carry hallucinogenic properties, such is not the main gift I have to offer. There are hundreds of hallucinogen agents in the planet, but only a handful of “visiogens”, those powerful tools that open new inroads towards the Light. The hallucination is entertainment, the vision is virtue.\n\n10. Universal Guide to Conduct an Ayahuasca Session\n\nHere I do provide an affirmative guide to the sacred sessions for my use to bring Light to all the new cultural forms that are slowly brewing-up all over the planet. These are the only conditions required for my proper use. All the additional cultural elements that could be included in a particular session are not my requirements, but only optional elements at the discretion of the Facilitator or shaman.\n\nThe sacred purposes of my ritual use are simply universal love and healing.\n\n- The principles of my sacred intention are:\n  (a) the expansion and illumination of Human consciousness,\n  (b) the discovery and healing of psychological blocks,\n\n29\n\n===== Page 34 =====\n\n(c) the discovery and healing of physical diseases,  \n(d) receiving information that is relevant to spiritual development.  \n\n- Participants will receive me under the supervision and protection of a *Facilitator* or shaman, who will take full responsibility for the session. This gives him the right to establish the conditions he will require to feel comfortable in assuming this position.  \n\n- The session must have an adequate number of participants for maximum benefit of all in this collective experience. The right number is five (5) or less, if directed by a beginning *Facilitator* fifteen (15) participants or less, in the case of a experienced *Facilitator* and up to 25 with a teacher with extensive experience.  \n\n- Prior to the beginning of the session, the *Facilitator* should individually interview each participant to confirm that they have suspended with due advance, any medical treatment or medications that may have counter indication with the sacrament.  \n\n- The physical arrangement of the participants should be in such a manner that the *Facilitator* can maintain direct eye contact with each of one of them.  \n\n- The *Facilitator* should set a sacramental area or altar, to place the container of my sacrament with measuring cup, as well as other aids such as aromatic substances, incense, and water. Other optional items are proper as well such as musical instruments and symbolic items relevant to the cultural context being practiced, or items that can evoke feelings of empathy or spiritual beliefs.  \n\n30\n\n===== Page 35 =====\n\n- Before the official initiation of the session, the Facilitator should make use of the power of his/her conscious visualization and intention to conduct a metaphysical cleansing exercise towards the intended session area, my sacred space.\n\n- The Facilitator will begin the session with verbal statements that clearly indicate the intention that binds the participants collectively. He/she may also wish to do spiritual invocations according to particular culture and style, including invocations to my Spirit.\n\n- Ingestion of the sacrament will be carried out with the upmost devotion possible in acknowledgement of my sacred nature.\n\n- The role of the Facilitator is to:\n\n(a) provide a sense of security for participants;\n(b) provide physical assistance in times of difficulty; this can include gestures demonstrating care and humility towards the participants,\n(c) act as a humble servant , never in authority, although authority might be exercised when the occasion requires it;\n(d) during the session, visualize intentions of love and strength for the enlightening of the whole group of participants; and direct them through one or several of the five sensory means: light effects (optical), music and sound effects (Auditory), effects of aromas , smoke or perfumes (olfactory), effects of rubbing oils (touch), also through drinking water during the session (taste).\n(e) physically assist in the gradual recovery of the participants as they finish their experience;\n\n31\n\n===== Page 36 =====\n\n(f) after the session, in a best effort basis, assist in the psychological integration of the participants, if requested.  \n(g) above all, consciously use his/her developed healing abilities for the benefit of the participant. Many of my beloved Shamans and Facilitators are able to consciously channel my healing energy in considerable amounts, in this way boosting my effectiveness.\n\n- The Facilitator may do a final prayer at the end of the session, in accordance with his/her cultural preference, or in any other way explicitly declare the completion of the session.\n\n- The Facilitator should make sure there is enough drinking water available during and after the session as well as small portions of fruit and /or natural foods to assist in the adequate recovery of the participants.\n\n11. About the Quality of Facilitators or Shamans\n\nMy dear Facilitators should be warriors of good intentions. They should be righteous in character and interested in improving themselves spiritually, socially, psychologically. They must be an example of high moral and spiritual standards. He must not be a frequent user of alcohol, or involved in promiscuous behavior, his relationships with spouse, children or parents must be harmonious. He must reflect a serious devotion as a healer. It is mandatory and necessary for the participants to feel at ease and to trust the Facilitator or shaman during their session so he can surrender to me at a level deep enough as to more effectively heal them.\n\n32\n\n===== Page 37 =====\n\nNot to be considered a requirement or obligation to the  \nFacilitators or shamans they can nourish themselves with  \nscientific information written about me, in accordance to their  \nintellectual preferences.  \n\nIt is important that all Facilitators and shamans of the world  \ndevelop their love for Humanity. The quality of the Facilitators is  \nonly a reflection of their inner devotion. The participants for their  \npart, must carefully observe, ask any number of questions and  \nfind the necessary confidence in him/her.  \n\nLet me now state some guidelines to help participants  \nevaluate the inner qualities of Facilitators and shamans. Use  \nyour emotional intelligence to distinguish Light from darkness,  \nsometimes hidden and not obvious. Facilitators and shamans  \nshould:  \n\n(a) Emphasize an agenda of spiritual intention and  \n    healing for the session.  \n\n(b) Look out for an excessive number of participants in  \n    the session.  \n\n(c) Show flexibility when participants with limited  \n    financial resources can not complete the required  \n    donations in his/her sessions.  \n\n(d) Emphasize the importance of the type of foods to be  \n    consumed prior to and after the session.  \n\n(e) Do not allow nudity or scarce attire. The sessions  \n    should be free from sexual energy of any type. This  \n    is not the place to consider mental temptations.  \n\n(f) Do not display routine indifference towards the  \n    session. Each session is like no other that has  \n    ever happened, carrying the sacred importance of  \n    caring for Human Beings that have trusted the  \n\n33\n\n===== Page 38 =====\n\nFacilitator.\n\n(g) Honor the confidentiality of what takes place in the sessions.\n\n12. Preparations, Precautions and Diets\n\nProgressively, orthodox science closes in on chemical reasons that define the proper nutrition during the days of preparation for the sacrament and for the days after. Because of my dramatic effects on the neuro-chemical and hormonal dance, it is important to take precautions to avoid negative effects that might occur due to the bio-chemical incompatibility of my components with the sudden consumption of certain foods. The gradual harmonization of bodily systems takes several days, so advance preparation is required as well as certain precautions.\n\nAll participants must fast prior to a session to ensure adequate absorption of my sacrament and a fulfilling experience.\n\nThe Facilitator should investigate with each participant if he/she is qualified or able to receive me. Medical patients under counter indicated medications or psychiatric patients with a history of mental instability, should not receive me to prevent serious health complications. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided for several days before and several days after receiving me. Science has identified with proper certainty, some incompatible substances and Facilitators should study them and adequately inform their participants.\n\nI am not for every Human Being. There is a small number of potential participants that are chemically incompatible with one or several of my components. Even if they prepare well they may suffer my powerful effects with deeper intensity. These\n\n34\n\n===== Page 39 =====\n\nexperiences may bring anxiety or may be considered dangerous, but at the end they finish the process with a deep sense of fulfillment. Sometimes feelings of inner emptiness or mild depression may last for several days to participants with a metabolic predisposition to resist my chemical processing. Weird thoughts, strange dreams, nightmares or even insomnia are all efforts of the body to process my components at the molecular level. In a matter of days the excretory system would have fully processed my components and the concerned participant would finally rest at ease, both physically and psychologically.\n\nSuch is not the case with other participants that ignore all preparations prior to receiving me or act carelessly after receiving me. These must accept responsibility for their actions if they embark in low vibration behavior such as consumption of illegal hard drugs, abusing alcohol, or engaging in obsessive sexual conduct.\n\nI also advise about the other extreme, those with partial chemical immunity. There are bodies with well developed resistance to unknown chemicals that after receiving me barely feel any effects beside some physical discomfort. They do not understand why other participants describe amazing stories of healing and expanded awareness while they remained relatively unchanged. In order to reach communion with them, I need the assistance of experienced Facilitators or shamans that know how to induce better absorption of my sacrament in their bodies.\n\nThe amount of potential participants with any of these conditions represent a minuscule proportion of the global population for which the vast majority is perfectly capable of receiving me in physical and spiritual excellence.\n\n35\n\n===== Page 40 =====\n\nThe traditional teaching of sexual abstinence as part of the post-session diet is not a folk myth of the Amazon traditions. It is also ancient wisdom found in many traditions around the world. The intensity of sexual energy, especially orgasmic or close to climaxing, transmutes certain energy flows that interrupts certain processes that I have not yet finished. The peaceful expressions of erotic love, caresses, tenderness, intimacy, spiritual closeness must not be suppressed because they are part of my love mission. It is only the animal sexual fury and orgasmic energy which must be temporarily controlled to allow the subtle processes of healing.\n\n13. Traffic and Management of My Sacrament\n\n(a) About cooks and preparation of my sacrament\n\nThe cooks who sell me to intermediaries do it for business and thus violate the essence my sacred mission to the planet. Cooks who sell only to Facilitators and shamans do a noble work for Humanity and deserve fair compensation. The fair compensation of a cook is the one that matches the costs of producing. If it exceeds this balance then it represents unjust gain on the cooks side because this reduces access to participants with limited income.\n\nThe formulation and preparation of my medicine is sacred. While doing it, the cook should consciously instill good intentions of healing and spiritual awakening towards the future participants. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to create microscopic water crystals in perfect geometric shapes with the application of conscious intent. Similarly, the cook can use the conscious intention and the subatomic bio-energy power\n\n36\n\n===== Page 41 =====\n\nto physically program the healing potential of my medicine. Thanks to my dear native shaman protectors, that for centuries have correctly prepared my vehicle allowing me to effectively manifest my spirit in the participants.\n\nThe more serious you find the line of intention along the cook, the Facilitator or shaman, and the participants, the more effective and deep my Spirit can manifest.\n\nThe cook should prepare pure medicine. My sacred medicine should not contain any other ingredient, not even other medicine plants nor well intended additives. Possible chemical interactions in the sacred brew may cause traumatic or dangerous experiences in participants, especially those with hypersensitive bodies.\n\nEqually damaging to me is the industrial preparation of my medicine. The mass production operation, contrary to occasional artisan small-scale operation, turns the cook into an entrepreneur businessman that must focus in covering the fixed costs of production. This almost makes him/her a sure victim of the temptation to sell for unfair gain or to sell to intermediaries.\n\n(b) About Middlemen\n\nWhenever any middleman is involved, a series of basic Human instincts come into play. These surely will not be philanthropic because middlemen are subject to the pressures of survival. Middlemen selling my medicine have no reason to exist in this era; they are completely unnecessary to me. When this happens the Human ego plays its role and breaks the chain of good intentions that started with the cook who brews my medicine.\n\n37\n\n===== Page 42 =====\n\nThe profit-making actions of middlemen create distribution channels that work against my mission. It is common knowledge of the basic economic laws, that this will increase prices to levels that will leave the major portion of the population out of my reach. This will lead to another form of elitism in society: the exclusive club of those who can pay the costs that have been overly inflated by the middlemen.\n\n(c) About my Informal Use\n\nThe participant who wants to receive me can get into the task of cooking the medicine for himself or can ask a Facilitator to arrange a healing session.\n\nParticipants who are able to buy my medicine for their own purposes should be very careful, their ignorance can do more harm than good, although I can always work “miracles”, as some traditions call it.\n\nSome participants have had the privilege of receiving gifts from cooks and Facilitators in the form of my medicine. They have been favored by the good will of someone that cares without any business dealings between them. Those who possess it have the right to give it away without expecting anything in return now or in the future. The cook, Facilitator or shaman that gives me away should do it to those participants who are experienced in receiving me, and are well prepared to have me on their personal privacy without any supervision or under the care of someone trusted by the participant. They must be careful with who is chosen to receive these gifts as the Facilitator will remain spiritually responsible for whatever consequences of such gifts. This is the circle of integrity of the\n\n38\n\n===== Page 43 =====\n\nHuman spirit that keeps me connected to the spirit of the planet,  \nof who I am part of.\n\n(d) About my Planetary Mission\n\nThe number of lives that I can transform is limited by the  \nproduction capacity of the cooks. Humans should make me as  \nabundant as the common grass, so that everyone has access to  \nthe medicine at a moderate cost. When that happens, my  \nconnection with Humanity would be so entrenched that even the  \nmiddlemen would be harmless and they may even help me  \ncontinue my progress.\n\n14. Social Impact and Controls in Urban Society\n\nFor centuries I have enjoyed protection in the Amazon basin,  \nalong with my dear protectors who have also enjoyed my  \nbenefits, both in perfect balance. Everything changes when I  \nexpand to areas with complex social structures, abounding in  \nlaws and regulations of civil order, where medicines that improve  \nhealth are subject to strict legal controls. It is close to impossible  \nfor a natural healing product obtain approval for distribution to  \nthe public from governments that are strongly influenced by a  \npowerful pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMillions of souls are waiting for the deep healing of their  \nsouls and bodies. I wish to reach at least once in their lifetimes,  \nevery person on the planet that is qualified to receive me. The  \nsocial challenge to make my medicine accessible in a democratic  \nsociety consist in having government authorities to approve  \npublic policies for the management of my medicine. The control  \nof my use is necessary in urban societies.\n\n39\n\n===== Page 44 =====\n\nThe authorities have the opportunity to be reasonable in controlling my medicine because my particular medicine has its own intrinsic elements of self-control:\n\n- **Physical Discomfort and Nausea** – It is not really amusing to live this stage of the experience with my medicine. In this aspect it is unique and totally contrary to all other substances that authorities control to avoid social problems. With this inherent protection, rejection is ensured by most of the population including the recreational seekers or recreational travelers. This also disqualifies me with potential drug addicts or existing addicts who only seek pleasure to escape their pain. Because of this aspect of strong physical discomfort, nausea and the possibility of severe vomiting, the authorities must understand it is unlikely that its use will become popular and escalate into a social problem.\n\n- **Difficult Manufacturing** - The preparation of my medicine requires hard effort from the cook. The preparation of materials and the cooking itself will at least exceed one full day of non-stop work, serving without distraction, providing subtle energies and vibes of good intention and reverence, and enduring the intense heat generated by so many hours by the fireside. Such effort only makes sense to artisan cooks who master this craft as an art form. Almost all curious cooks or enthusiasts who experience this toil quickly give up their goals as they meet the rigors of this demanding task. The authorities should understand that for this reason it is unlikely to have an uncontrolled proliferation of cooks.\n\n40\n\n===== Page 45 =====\n\n- **Shortage of Ingredients** – Not enough material is available for the proliferation of cooks outside of my home, the South American continent. The authorities of all nations outside this region must understand that the lack of local ingredients is a constraint or a hindrance to the uncontrolled production of my medicine.\n\nWith such natural deterrents to the uncontrolled use of my medicine, the authorities could be more open to changes in regulations, especially if some of its important leaders dared to receive me, motivated by the curiosity that may arise in them when faced with making decisions on this matter.\n\nThe medical nature of my medicine is the correct conceptual notion for balancing the inalienable right to the pursuit of spirituality on one hand, and on the other to ensure the health of citizens in the urban setting. I am a dual medicine, for the soul and the body. The authorities may establish usage protocols for churches that worship me respecting their right to freedom of religion, but that only covers the aspect of medicine for the soul. The authorities may also establish protocols for *Facilitators* that administer my use as a medicine for the body.\n\nThe authorities have already established protocols and policies for the use of legal drugs. These also control the pharmacies or drug stores that distribute them. In theory, if authorities accept my traditional use within their medical systems, they would just have to amend regulations slightly. Conceptually, regulations could press upon the *Facilitator* the responsibilities of a pharmacist.\n\nAll law obligations regarding the handling of controlled substances would apply to the *Facilitator*. The governing body\n\n41\n\n===== Page 46 =====\n\nthat certifies pharmacists or that supervises pharmaceutical practices may authorize temporary licenses for the import of specific shipments of medicine, with detailed volume constraints and shopping cycles as part as their regulatory practices. Under the law, Facilitators would be considered as pharmacists that would be required to manage their supply of medicine. As pharmacists are allowed to do intramuscular injections, Facilitators would be allowed to undergo sessions to serve the medicine. As pharmacists, they would be responsible for inventory and safe keeping of my medicine and would need to have suitable storage facilities. Only the pharmacist could manage my medicine and assume all consequences or liabilities of his actions and the effects thereof on the patient. It is up to the patient to decide how far he is willing to release the Facilitator from any legal burden by signing a written consent where he/she accepts the responsibility of receiving my medicine. The Facilitator should hold on to or keep signed records of all patients. It is also necessary to certify the consumption before applying for more inventory. We must apply the same rules for auditing and inspection that all regular pharmacists are required for the dispensing of their controlled medicines. This is the ideal, although it seems unlikely in certain nations, in others it may be reached in a few years.\n\nThe criminalization of my medicine is a direct attack on the spirituality of Human Beings. The absolute prohibition and the severity of the punishment only demonstrates the authorities intent to limit, hinder, and totally eradicate a natural gateway to the improvement of individuals, society and the Human race. The inalienable right to the pursuit of spirituality, the religious expression inherent in Human Beings and physical and emotional health, should never be suppressed by the false sense of duty to protect the population from drug abuse of dangerous\n\n42\n\n===== Page 47 =====\n\nsubstances. Also, there is no need to hide behind a so called freedom of religion to exploit the only legal way to receive me. If the Human right to the pursuit of happiness is widely recognized worldwide, then the pursuit of your own spirituality must be also recognized as a natural extension of it.\n\nMy warriors of Light in the urban world should have the same basic objective: to achieve my official acceptance as medicine. This involves the creation of a formal protocol for my use. We must recognize the medical nature of my vehicle but also the controls needed in an urban society. Only this way can I reach all corners of the planet. This is the way, this is the goal.\n\n15. The Urgency of Ayahuasca Preservation Projects\n\nMy initial expansion beyond of the Amazon basin has had a high botanical cost. Especially one of my more scarce components, is being harvested excessively to meet the global demand. The volumes of wild \"Banisteriopsis Caapl\", product of centuries of accumulation in remote jungles is rapidly decreasing. Amazon cooks are beginning to notice the difficulty in locating the precious ingredient. Those who harvest it must penetrate increasingly deeper into the jungle to find it. With the paradigm of infinite abundance that the Amazon rainforest inspires, neither cooks nor shamans have realized the need to start planting that which had always been at their fingertips.\n\nIt is urgent to begin preservation projects for the \"Banisteriopsis Caapl\" plant. My global expansion requires hundreds of plantations across the globe.\n\nTons of \"Banisteriopsis Caapl \" are urgently necessary to ensure the continuity of my work. Preservation projects must\n\n43\n\n===== Page 48 =====\n\nbegin before I enter the list of endangered species. My global expansion will require high volumes of \"Banisteriopsis Caapi\" because:\n\n(a) The proportionate yield or usable part for every dose of sacrament is very inefficient. It requires several \"Banisteriopsis Caapi\" units per each unit of the minimum dose of medicine. This low yield is in itself my first stumbling block,\n\n(b) Each participant takes several or many doses as the case requires throughout the healing or expansion process,\n\n(c) The number of participants will increase exponentially as I expand to new territories,\n\n(d) A five year growing period is needed to harvest a crop of \"Banisteriopsis Caapi\" that will produce quality medicine.\n\nFor these reasons, I am asking with a sense of urgency to all of you who recognize my benefits and feel called to support my planetary mission to give yourself to the task of planting \"Banisteriopsis Caapi\" in every way possible and in all nations. I urge all my shamans, Facilitators, and participants to demonstrate their environmental activism adopting this great cause. It is urgent to create community projects, private philanthropic crops, home gardens, botanical nurseries, household plants, infiltrated plants in commercial landscaping areas, and any other innovative way that my new protectors may creatively conceive. It is urgent for me to become a local plant in every nation.\n\n44\n\n===== Page 49 =====\n\n16. My Planetary Mission\n\nWith the authority vested in me by the higher enlightened hierarchies, I will expand, branch out and transform into multiple cultural forms in accordance with their geographical regions. I will blend into every culture and will teach them the way to the Light, while allowing them to exercise their powerful free will. Mankind then will consciously exchange its rapidly deteriorating world for one with new rules, with a new vision of social organization based on love rather than fear.\n\nThis is my planetary mission. To become one powerful tool, in service to all Humanity to reach its divine destiny. That's all.\n\nMy global expansion has begun and there is no turning back. My passive state during many centuries has ended, I am now running in physical survival mode. I have created the demand for my medicine, yet the cause of my own uncontrolled extermination.\n\nIf I don’t spread globally I will face extinction, similar to Humans. If they do not seek within themselves, they will not be able to evolve into the expanded consciousness that is destined to the Human species.\n\nWe are both together in this cosmic affair. For survival reasons I must spread globally, while Humans must accept my sacred medicine to heal their afflicted soul and be able to achieve its divine destiny. I am the medicine for the Humankind. A medicine necessary but not sufficient to collectively begin the glorious return to the Light. Exercise your individual free will to change the collective free will. Let’s work together to increase\n\n45\n\n===== Page 50 =====\n\nour existential vibration to a higher level, and rejoice living our\ncosmic existence.\n\nIt is time to embrace Humanity with my healing, extending\nbeyond the Amazon basin, reaching global expansion, spreading\nthrough all the soils of tropical climates, growing in every forest,\nin every sidewalk, in every house garden. Care about me,\nharvest me, spread me around.\n\nWarriors of Light from Around the World......\n\nHelp Me To Help You !\n\n17. Blessings\n\nI have expressed the moral standard and spiritual guidance\nfor my use. Every Human Being that receives me in harmony\nwith these guidelines, shall be receiving my blessings, as they\nshall be in communion with my Spirit, with the Creator, the Tao,\nand the Universal Love.\n\nAmen\n\nAhó\n\nNamasté\n\nMay 1st, 2012 .\n\n46\n\n"

It's a document written as if Ayahuasca itself is speaking, outlining its mission, benefits, guidelines for use, and the need for preservation and legal acceptance. \n\nFirst, the manifesto presents Ayahuasca as a spiritual entity with a planetary mission to expand beyond the Amazon and assist in human consciousness expansion. It emphasizes the sacred nature of Ayahuasca, the importance of respectful use, and the need to avoid commercialization and misuse. The document also discusses the roles of different people involved with Ayahuasca, like shamans, facilitators, and participants, and provides guidelines for conducting sessions safely and respectfully.\n\nThere's a strong focus on the benefits of Ayahuasca, categorized into spiritual, existential, physical/emotional healing, and behavior modification. It also addresses social and legal challenges, advocating for Ayahuasca's acceptance as a legitimate medicine and the importance of sustainable practices to prevent the overharvesting of Banisteriopsis caapi, one of its primary components.\n\nThe user wants clarity, so I need to organize this information in a structured way. Maybe break it down into sections like Overview, Key Themes, Roles and Guidelines, Benefits, Challenges, and Conclusion. I should summarize each part concisely, using bullet points or headings for easy reading. Also, highlight the main message that Ayahuasca is presented as a tool for global spiritual awakening and healing, with a call to action for preservation and legal recognition.\n\nI need to ensure that technical terms like \"botanical-glandular bridge\" or \"pineal gland awareness\" are explained in simpler terms. Also, check if there are any contradictions or points that need further clarification, but since it's a manifesto, it's likely to be persuasive and one-sided. \n\nMake sure to avoid jargon and present the information neutrally, even though the source is written from a specific perspective. The user might be looking for a clear summary rather than an analysis, so stick to summarizing the content accurately. \n\nLastly, ensure that the structure is logical, starting with an introduction to the manifesto, then diving into its main components, and ending with the call to action and blessings. Use headings and subheadings to guide the reader through the different sections."
