# Creating Vivid Image Prompts for Amazon Products


> **User:** create detailed and descriptive image prompts based on https://bubblespider.com/amazon/best-sellers


> **Assistant (thinking):** Okay, the user wants me to create detailed and descriptive image prompts based on the best sellers from bubblespider.com/amazon/best-sellers. First, I need to figure out what products are listed there. But since I can't access external websites, I should make educated guesses based on typical Amazon best sellers. Common categories include electronics, home goods, books, toys, beauty products, etc.
> I should cover a range of categories to make the image prompts diverse. Let me brainstorm a few categories. Maybe start with electronics, like wireless earbuds. Then kitchen gadgets, such as air fryers. Fitness equipment is always popular, so maybe resistance bands. Books, especially self-help or popular fiction. Toys, like LEGO sets. Skincare products, perhaps a serum. Home essentials like microfiber towels. Pet products, maybe a cat tree. Outdoor gear like a camping hammock. And office supplies like a planner.
> Next, I need to create vivid descriptions for each product. Each prompt should include the setting, colors, textures, and maybe some context to make the image come alive. For example, the wireless earbuds could be in a gym setting with dynamic lighting. The air fryer might be in a modern kitchen with steam and crispy food. I should ensure each prompt highlights the product's features and the atmosphere around it.
> I need to check if there's any specific detail the user might want emphasized. Since they mentioned "detailed and descriptive," including sensory elements like light, texture, and environment is key. Also, making sure each image prompt is unique and covers different scenarios. Maybe 10 prompts to cover a variety of products. Let me list them out with clear, engaging visuals.

Here are detailed, vivid image prompts inspired by common Amazon best-seller categories (electronics, home goods, fitness, etc.), crafted to highlight product appeal and atmosphere:

---
### 1.**Wireless Earbuds**
**Prompt:**
"A sleek pair of matte-black wireless earbuds rests in an open charging case, glowing with a soft cyan LED light. The scene is set in a modern gym: blurred dumbbells and a water bottle in the background, sunlight streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows. The earbuds reflect a metallic sheen, emphasizing sweat-resistant texture. Dynamic motion lines suggest a user jogging on a treadmill nearby."

---
### 2.**Air Fryer in Action**
**Prompt:**
"A stainless-steel air fryer dominates a rustic kitchen countertop, golden french fries spilling out of its basket onto a checked parchment paper. Steam rises faintly, with crispy herbs and a lemon wedge nearby. Warm overhead lighting casts shadows on a chalkboard recipe labeled 'CRISPY 15 MIN RECIPE!' and a wooden spoon smeared with olive oil."

---
### 3.**Yoga Resistance Bands**
**Prompt:**
"A set of pastel resistance bands (lavender, mint, peach) lies coiled on a bamboo yoga mat. A hand reaches into the frame, stretching a band against a sunrise backdrop at the beach. Sand particles glint in the air, and a water bottle with condensation droplets sits nearby. Soft focus on distant crashing waves adds serenity."

---
### 4.**Bestselling Self-Help Book**
**Prompt:**
"An open hardcover book titled*Atomic Habits*rests on a velvet couch, sunlight filtering through sheer curtains. A highlighted passage reads, 'Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results.' A steaming mug, round glasses, and a leather journal with a gold pen sit beside it. Warm, cozy tones evoke quiet inspiration."

---
### 5.**Kids’ LEGO Set**
**Prompt:**
"A colorful LEGO spaceship mid-assembly on a rainbow playmat. Tiny hands place a red brick atop the structure, with scattered pieces in primary colors nearby. A poster of planets hangs on a vibrant bedroom wall. Sunlight streams through a window, casting playful shadows from a stuffed dinosaur."

---
### 6.**Vitamin C Serum**
**Prompt:**
"A glass dropper bottle of amber serum glows under minimalist studio lighting. A droplet clings to the dropper, refracting light like a prism. Fresh citrus slices and aloe leaves frame the bottle on a marble tray. Soft bokeh highlights dew-like moisture on the serum’s surface."

---
### 7.**Microfiber Cleaning Cloths**
**Prompt:**
"A stack of rainbow microfiber cloths, folded neatly on a sparkling glass table. One cloth is mid-wipe, smearing a streak across a pane with sunlight highlighting dust particles. A spray bottle labeled 'Streak-Free Shine' and a potted monstera add freshness to the modern living room."

---
### 8.**Cat Tree Condo**
**Prompt:**
"A towering beige sisal cat tree with dangling feather toys, set by a sunlit window. A fluffy tabby cat perches on the top platform, pawing at a sunbeam. Plush cushions on lower levels and scattered catnip mice complete the scene. Blurred bookshelves and plants fill the cozy background."

---
### 9.**Camping Hammock**
**Prompt:**
"A striped hammock strung between pine trees in a lush forest. A backpack and hiking boots sit on mossy ground below. Soft golden-hour light filters through trees, illuminating a thermos and open map beside a crackling campfire. Distant mountain peaks fade into a dusky blue sky."

---
### 10.**Planner & Sticker Set**
**Prompt:**
"An undated planner splayed open on a wooden desk, pages filled with floral stickers, washi tape, and handwritten goals. A cup of pastel markers, a pink ceramic mug, and a succulent sit nearby. Morning light casts long shadows, with a laptop blurred in the background."

> **User:** view-source:https://bubblespider.com/amazon/best-sellers


> **Assistant (thinking):** Okay, the user is asking for the view-source of a specific URL. Let me check what that URL is. It's https://bubblespider.com/amazon/best-sellers.
> Wait, I remember in the previous interaction, the user asked for image prompts based on that site, and I provided them. Now they’re trying to view the source code. But when I attempt to access the URL, I can't actually retrieve the content because I don't have browsing capabilities. So, I need to inform them that I can't access external websites or view their source code directly.
> The user might be trying to see how the website is structured, maybe to scrape data or understand how the best-sellers are listed. They could be a developer or someone interested in web scraping. But since I can't help with that, I should explain the limitation clearly.
> I should also offer alternative assistance. Maybe they want to generate image prompts for other products or need help with something else related to Amazon best-sellers. Let me make sure to mention that. Also, I need to keep the tone helpful and friendly, not discouraging.
> Hmm, maybe they didn't realize that I can't access live sites. It's possible they thought the previous response was generated by scraping the site, but actually, it was based on common knowledge of Amazon categories. I should clarify that too, to avoid confusion.
> So, structuring the response: first, explain the limitation, then offer alternatives. Check for typos in the URL? No, looks correct. But the site might be third-party, not Amazon directly. Anyway, stick to the facts. Let them know I can't view the source but can help with other tasks.
> I should also ensure there's no security risk here. Viewing source code is generally safe, but advising against sharing sensitive info. But since the user is just asking for view-source, probably not an issue.
> Alright, putting it all together. Clear explanation, offer alternatives, friendly tone. That should cover it.
