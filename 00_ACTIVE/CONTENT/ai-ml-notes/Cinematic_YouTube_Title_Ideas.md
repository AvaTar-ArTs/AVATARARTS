To optimize your YouTube thumbnail design for maximum engagement, consider the following best practices:

**1. Ideal Thumbnail Dimensions and Resolution:**

**Applying These Insights to Your Design:**

Given your existing design—a gas mask-wearing figure smashing a retro TV screen to reveal the text 'WELCOME TO THE DOMINION – WHERE FREEDOM WENT TO DIE' against a cyberpunk city backdrop—consider the following adjustments:

- **Text Legibility:** Ensure the title text is prominent and readable, possibly by increasing font size or adding a contrasting outline.

- **Color Scheme:** Enhance the use of high-contrast colors to make the thumbnail more eye-catching.

- **Simplification:** Remove any extraneous elements that may clutter the image, focusing on the central theme to avoid viewer confusion.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a compelling and effective YouTube thumbnail that attracts viewers and accurately represents your content. 

For a YouTube **Shorts** thumbnail, the optimization needs to be even more focused since Shorts primarily display in a **vertical format (9:16)** and appear on mobile screens. Here’s how to **fix and optimize your design** for maximum impact:

---

### **1. Adjust Aspect Ratio & Composition**
- Ensure the thumbnail is designed in **1080x1920 resolution** to match the Shorts format.
- Move key elements (text and subject) **to the center** so they don’t get cut off by the YouTube interface.

### **2. Improve Text Visibility**
- Use **big, bold fonts** so text is **readable at a glance**.
- Add a **stroke or shadow** behind the text for contrast.
- Reduce text length: Consider just **"WELCOME TO THE DOMINION"** with "WHERE FREEDOM WENT TO DIE" in a **smaller subtitle**.

### **3. Enhance Contrast & Colors**
- **Neon colors** work well in cyberpunk themes, but ensure the **text isn’t blending into the background**.
- Try using a **black or red background glow** around the title for maximum visibility.

### **4. Remove Unnecessary Details**
- The **TV screen smashing effect** is great, but it might be **too detailed for a small thumbnail**.
- Simplify the scene: Maybe just show the **cracked screen with the neon text** glowing through.

### **5. Make It More Click-Worthy**
- If possible, add **a human element or intense emotion**.
- A **masked figure staring at the viewer** might be more **engaging** than a full-body action shot.

---

### **Final Fix Plan**
1. **Center** the title in a large, readable font.
2. **Increase contrast** by adding a neon glow or outline.
3. **Simplify** the details (focus on the cracked TV and neon text).
4. **Frame it properly** so nothing important gets cut off on mobile.
5. **Test a few variations** to see which gets a better CTR.

I can **generate a new version** of the image based on these fixes. Would you like me to make a revised **1080x1920 version** with these improvements?

I've replaced "die" with "erased" for a more SEO-friendly approach. Here are the updated images:

1. **First Image:** A gas mask-wearing figure smashes a TV screen revealing "WELCOME TO THE DOMINION – WHERE FREEDOM WAS ERASED."
2. **Second Image:** A massive, cracked TV screen embedded in a dystopian cityscape, with gas-masked figures marching below, featuring the same revised text.
