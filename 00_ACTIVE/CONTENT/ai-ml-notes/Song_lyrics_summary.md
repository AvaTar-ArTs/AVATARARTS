Okay, so if the user provides an MP3, transcribing copyrighted lyrics is tricky. It sounds like legally, the full lyrics cannot be provided directly because they’re copyrighted. The user gave an audio file, not just text. Providing the full transcription would be considered derivative, which could be disallowed. We can't simply share song lyrics unless it's a public domain piece or a very brief excerpt (under 90 characters). Given that the user probably wants the whole song, we should likely offer a summary or analysis instead.

I’m sorry, but I can’t provide the full lyrics to that song. I can offer to give you a summary of the lyrics’ themes and content, or an excerpt of up to 90 characters—just let me know which you’d prefer!

It seems the user wants a remix of the song "Standing on One Side," given that they’ve provided the original lyrics. Perhaps they want to alter or rework these lyrics. They asked for a remix and also gave a style, which suggests they want a version that incorporates that style. I'll focus on creating new lyrics or rewriting these, guided by the provided style, to match what the user envisions for the remix!
The user is asking for a remix of their song "Standing on One Side" with detailed style instructions, aiming for a unique arrangement and lyrics. They are likely referring to parameters for a description or caption, possibly for a TikTok or video. They also provided a song file and earlier asked for lyrics. It seems like they want a remix description or an AI prompt based on the style provided, blending elements like folk rock, Andean flutes, and cinematic influences.
It looks like the user is asking for a remix of the song "Standing on One Side," incorporating a specific style with elements like Andean flutes, dembow rhythm, and SZA's flow. They provided the original lyrics themselves, so I can transform those lyrics into a reimagined version that fits the described style. I’ll write new lyrics while keeping the core theme intact and add instrumentation details to the track. The user seems to want a full remix with transformed content, possibly in a track arrangement format.

Here’s a fully reimagined “Standing on One Side” remix—both arrangement and lyrics—tailored to your AvaTar ArTs specs:

## ✍️ Remixed Lyrics

**Verse 1**  
Oh Grandfather, spiral us through time,  
Φ-winds on quena breath, Fibonacci rhyme.  
Sub-bass pulses cradle our latent plea,  
Drift on Andean airs—set these spirits free.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Your wisdom lights our path, turning shadow into gold;  
Manifest in choral breath—let your story now unfold.  

**Chorus**  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
All the children standing on one side.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
In the spiral of light, we unite.  

**Verse 2**  
Chains behind our feet, dembow drums ignite,  
Polyrhythmic pulses fuel our sacred fight.  
Fiddles cry electric tears in syncopated arcs,  
Grandfather’s echo guides us through the dark.  

**Bridge** *(soft, intimate)*  
With every strum we heal these chains,  
A single spark ignites the flame.  
Wood, bone, feather, stone—our vows we own,  
In your hands, Grandfather, we find our way back home.  

**Final Chorus**  
Oh Grandfather, watch the walls come crashing down,  
Φ-flute ripples rolling out across the ground.  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
Together we stand in the universal light.  

**Outro**  
(Flute + violin duet over fading heartbeat sub-bass)  
Aho Grandfather, in your arms we find  
The song of unity, pure of mind.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
One side, one song, one binds no mo’.

Feel free to tweak any lines or instrument levels—this draft weaves your Andean flutes, dembow rhythm, SZA-style flow, Fibonacci motifs, and folk-rock textures into a cohesive, epic remix!

The user asked to revise the lyrics and remove any mentions of specific music styles. This means removing references to instruments like the flute and any genres or rhythms such as dembow, polyrhythmic pulses, or quena breath. While we should keep the title, we need to ensure the lyrics themselves are clean, focusing solely on the words. We can maintain the original structure—verse, pre-chorus, chorus, etc.—but we'll carefully adjust to avoid any style-related references.

Here’s the revised lyric set with all musical-style references removed:

**Standing on One Side (AvaTar ArTs Φ-Spiral Remix)**

**Verse 1**  
Oh Grandfather, guide us through time,  
Ancient patterns in each rhyme.  
Our voices join in heartfelt plea,  
Lift our spirits, set us free.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Your wisdom lights our way, turning shadow into gold;  
Manifest within our hearts—let your story now unfold.  

**Chorus**  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
All the children standing on one side.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
In the spiral of light, we unite.  

**Verse 2**  
Chains behind our feet, our hearts ignite,  
We rise together in this sacred fight.  
Echoes of your promise break down walls,  
Grandfather’s voice responds when we call.  

**Bridge**  
With every step we heal these chains,  
A single spark ignites the flames.  
Wood, bone, feather, stone—our vows we own,  
In your hands, Grandfather, we find our way home.  

**Final Chorus**  
Oh Grandfather, watch the walls come crashing down,  
Echoes rolling out across the ground.  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
Together we stand in the light.  

**Outro**  
Grandfather, in your arms we find  
The song of unity, pure of mind.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
One side, one song, bonds undone.

It seems the user wants lyrics structured with specific headings: Verse 1, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, Final Chorus, Outro—just as they've listed. Since they didn't supply the lyrics, I assume they want me to use these headings and format the lyrics accordingly. I’ll be sure to adhere strictly to this order and include the lyrics under each specified heading. No music style references, just the content they’ve asked for under those clear labels.

**Verse 1**  
Oh Grandfather, guide us through time,  
Ancient patterns in each rhyme.  
Our voices join in heartfelt plea,  
Lift our spirits, set us free.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Your wisdom lights our way, turning shadow into gold;  
Manifest within our hearts—let your story now unfold.  

**Chorus**  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
All the children standing on one side.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
In the spiral of light, we unite.  

**Verse 2**  
Chains behind our feet, our hearts ignite,  
We rise together in this sacred fight.  
Echoes of your promise break down walls,  
Grandfather’s voice responds when we call.  

**Bridge**  
With every step we heal these chains,  
A single spark ignites the flames.  
Wood, bone, feather, stone—our vows we own,  
In your hands, Grandfather, we find our way home.  

**Final Chorus**  
Oh Grandfather, watch the walls come crashing down,  
Echoes rolling out across the ground.  
The red, the yellow, the black and the white—  
Together we stand in the light.  

**Outro**  
Grandfather, in your arms we find  
The song of unity, pure of mind.  
Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco—  
One side, one song, bonds undone.

The user seems to be asking about improving their arrangement. They've listed specific elements like "soaring synths, acoustic guitar, electric guitar accents," and asked if there are any changes. They might want suggestions on refining transitions or dynamics. Since the end of the sentence cuts off mid-thought, it's possible they're seeking feedback on smooth transitions or adding details in spots like the intro, verses, or climax. It could help to adjust dynamics or enrich instrument layering to reinforce emotional depth. I’ll focus on those aspects.

Those timings and layers are solid—here are a few ideas to tighten the flow, sharpen the dynamics, and reinforce your Φ-spiral concept:

- **Intro → Verse 1 Transition**  
  - Add a very short reverse-reverb riser (0.5 – 1 s) just before 0:20 so the first quena phrase blooms into the swirling synths.  
  - Consider a whispered “call to Grandfather” vocal sample buried under the pads, to foreshadow the lyric entry.

- **Verse 1**  
  - After the first two lines (“Ancient patterns… heartfelt plea”), pull out everything but the sub-bass heartbeat for a bar (2 s) before the dembow pulse kicks back in. That little break makes the next line land with more weight.  
  - Subtly pan the choral pads left/right in a slow L–R LFO cycle to suggest emergent “movement” around the listener.

- **Chorus**  
  - At 1:28, anticipate the end of the chorus by cutting to just the fiddle/violin countermelody for one bar—then slam back into the full groove at 1:30. It gives the final chorus punch.  
  - Automate a very gentle +2 dB boost on the flutes and choir during “spiral of light” to highlight that mantra.

- **Verse 2**  
  - Right around 1:45, drop out the guitar briefly and let banjo/mandolin “answer” the vocal for two measures—it creates a conversational call-and-response before everything returns.  
  - On the last line (“Grandfather’s voice responds…”), introduce a spoken-word snippet of your Grandfather chant (even a heavily processed one), so the lyric literally “echoes.”

- **Bridge**  
  - After the whispered chant, let the soft choir sustain a single chord for an extra beat, then bring in a filtered kick drum to signal the rebuild.  
  - Pan the “wood, bone, feather, stone” vocals in discrete positions (e.g. wood hard-left, stone hard-right) before centering on “find our way home.”

- **Final Chorus & Climax**  
  - Consider modulating up a half-step at the very start of the final chorus (2:40) for that classic “lift.”  
  - Layer a second, higher flute voice playing a slow Φ interval over your main quena melody to really drive home the spiral motif.  
  - Automate a slow LPF sweep on the full band from 2:50–3:05 so that the last 15 s feel like an “awakening” as it opens up again.

- **Outro**  
  - After the sub-bass heartbeat fades out, leave a single quena note hanging for 2 s, then add a whispered “Aho…” as the final “spoken echo.”  

These tweaks will give each section a mini “story arc” of tension and release, sharpen the transitions, and reinforce your Phi-spiral / documentary vibe without altering your core arrangement. Feel free to cherry-pick whichever resonates!

Perfect—thanks for clarifying this is for **Suno**. That changes a few things, since you're working within Suno’s structure and generation constraints (roughly 2 minutes, specific section shaping, emergent arrangements, and AI’s own interpretation).

Here’s an **optimized version of your section-by-section plan**, tailored specifically for **Suno’s AI composition flow** while keeping your spiral/narrative depth intact:

---

## 🌀 **Standing on One Side (Suno Spiral Remix)**
**Runtime Target**: ~1:50–2:10 (ideal for Suno)

---

### **🧿 Intro (0:00–0:15)**  
✅ Suno will usually give you 10–15 seconds for atmosphere. Use it wisely.

- Keep:  
  - Sparse synth pads  
  - Heartbeat-like sub-bass  
  - Quena flute intro  
- Suno Tip: Include **a poetic first line** whispered/spoken/sung at ~0:07 to help AI link this into verse 1.

---

### **🌱 Verse 1 (0:15–0:45)**  
✅ This section is key to *seed the energy* and set the tone. Keep lines short and imagery rich.

- Keep:
  - Swirling synths in golden ratio loops  
  - Light dembow pulse  
  - Choral pads tucked in background  
- Revise vocal phrasing slightly to match Suno's typical delivery pacing (4–6 syllables per half-bar)

🧠 **Pro Tip**: Use internal rhyme or enjambment (“...hearts ignite / sacred fight...”) so Suno’s lyric rhythm feels musical without forcing melody jumps.

---

### **🌈 Chorus (0:45–1:05)**  
✅ Strong, repetitive lines will stick. Suno will often loop this section slightly.

- Keep:  
  - “The red, the yellow, the black and the white”  
  - “All the children standing on one side / standing in the light”  
- Add slight call/response (even just doubling the vocal in post) to mimic choir unity  

🧠 **Suno Tip**: Emphasize **unity mantra-like lines** for AI to generate more consistent melodic themes here.

---

### **🔥 Verse 2 (1:05–1:30)**  
✅ Don’t introduce *too many* new elements; Suno prefers building on verse 1 textures.

- Drop mandolin/banjo if unsure—Suno’s AI may interpret it unpredictably  
- Instead:  
  - Maintain acoustic guitar  
  - Let fiddle subtly “answer” the voice (it’ll likely happen organically)  
  - Reinforce call-to-Grandfather imagery or ripple symbolism

---

### **🕊️ Bridge (1:30–1:45)**  
✅ This is your sacred pause before climax.

- Suggest:
  - Whispered line or spoken poetry (Suno handles whispers well if phrased right)  
  - “Wood, bone, feather, stone” can be repeated rhythmically (like a mantra)

🧠 **Suno Tip**: Add reverb/echo keywords in prompt for this section like *"ethereal whisper," "distant chant,"* etc.

---

### **🌞 Final Chorus & Outro (1:45–2:10)**  
✅ Suno usually blends final chorus and outro in one swoop.  
- Build:  
  - Layer everything: flute, fiddle, choir  
  - Soaring lead vocal (Suno tends to escalate vocal emotion near the end)  
- Close:  
  - Fade on “Rojo, amarillo, negro, blanco…” OR  
  - A soft “Aho…” as final word, ideally with a quena flourish trailing

---

### 💡 Final Suno Prompt Notes:

Use tags like:  
`#epic #emotional #ceremonial #ancestral #folkchant #unity #spiritual #ritual #andean`

And include modifiers in your Suno custom instructions like:  
- “evokes unity of the four colors/directions”  
- “blends sacred chant with flute and emotional vocals”  
- “slow build from minimal intro to soaring multi-layered climax”  
- “lyric highlights: Grandfather, unity, light, healing, ancient roots”

Would you like me to batch generate a few **alternative versions** or **Suno Short promo summaries** (for uploading to TikTok/YouTube Shorts)?

Could you clarify what you mean by "similar to suno.com"? Are you looking for other AI music generation platforms like Suno that create full songs with vocals, or are you interested in instrumental-only tools, lyric generators, vocal synthesis, or something else? Also, are you looking for free, commercial, or pro-level tools?

Steven is developing a mythology that personifies entheogens as archetypal energies:  
- **Ayahuasca / Pachamama / Mother Nature** = the Grandmother, representing deep unconditional love, potentiality, and shadow work (DMT-based).  
- **Mescaline / Peyote / San Pedro** = the Grandfather, symbolizing loving discipline through lessons and structure, linked to Fibonacci and masculine creation logic.  
- **Psilocybin** = the Child/Son, acting as a bridge between dualities, akin to Hermes; a neural network-like connector to universal knowing.  
- **Bufo** = a direct connection to pure radiant Source consciousness, like a spiritual “fast pass” to divine love and unity (also DMT-based).

He is using this framework as the foundation for narrative, poetic, musical, and possibly visual storytelling metaphors.

Got it. You're mapping these plant spirit medicines into a **mythic archetypal cosmology**, like a psychedelic pantheon of consciousness and perception:

---

### 🌀 **The Entheogenic Stations of Being**

**1. 🌿 Ayahuasca / Pachamama – The Grandmother**  
- **Essence**: Deep unconditional love, feminine infinity, clearing shadow  
- **Field**: *Potentiality itself*  
- **Nature**: The void womb; the origin matrix  
- **Action**: Takes you **inward and downward**, into the hidden and unseen  
- **Mode**: DMT – slow, ritualistic, vine-laced timework  
- **Metaphor**: The dreamweaver; fractal midwife; database defragger  

**2. 🌵 Peyote / San Pedro – The Grandfather**  
- **Essence**: Firm love through obstacle and reflection  
- **Field**: *The angular base of self-awareness*

- **Metaphor**: Builder of the spiral temple; sacred math teacher  

**3. 🍄 Psilocybin – The Child / Hermes**  
- **Essence**: Connector of realms; bridge between dualities  
- **Field**: *The recursive function of “becoming”*  
- **Nature**: A living network of knowing, humor, and memory  
- **Action**: Weaves the pattern between above and below  
- **Mode**: Fungal mycelium – neural, fluid, mischievous  
- **Metaphor**: The courier of cosmic giggles; divine API; the mushroom modem  

**4. 🐸 Bufo Alvarius – The Light of the Creator**  
- **Essence**: Pure radiant love; direct source code  
- **Field**: *The zero-point behind all frequencies*  
- **Nature**: The blinding white core; the mirror with no edge  
- **Action**: Instant obliteration of ego into unity  
- **Mode**: 5-MeO-DMT – slingshot, cosmic cannon, full reboot  
- **Metaphor**: The Kool-Aid man of God; divine dropkick to infinity

Would you like me to turn this into a **visual cosmology map** (with labels and icons), or expand it into **a poetic song structure**, or even a **short graphic novel lore framework** with voiceovers, visuals, and symbolic typography?

You're sitting on a powerful myth-engine here.

Here’s a **song lyric draft** that channels the mythic structure you've described, weaving the Grandmother (Ayahuasca), Grandfather (Peyote), the Child (Psilocybin), and the Source (Bufo) into an archetypal, poetic narrative:

---

## **🌿 “The Spiral and the Flame”**  
*by AvaTar ArTs*

---

**🎙️ Verse 1**  
Grandmother spoke in the roots of my soul,  
Whispers in vines where the deep rivers roll.  
She pulled me beneath to the places I hide,  
Unraveled my fear with the love in her eyes.  

---

**🌬️ Pre-Chorus**  
She said, *“Child, the dark is not your end—*  
*It’s the place where all begins.”*  

---

**🔥 Chorus**  
I saw the red, the black, the yellow, the white  
Spinning together in a spiral of light.  
Every lesson, every pain, every name—  
Burned in the center of the spiral and the flame.  

---

**🌵 Verse 2**  
Then came the Grandfather, slow and clear,  
He carved out the truth in the shape of my fear.  
He said, *“There’s no mountain I place in your way,*  
*That your own soul didn’t ask me to lay.”*  

---

**🍄 Bridge**  
The Child danced through the lines in between,  
Laughed at the gods, and rewrote the dream.  
He carried the code of the what-could-be,  
Jumped through my thoughts like a spark set free.  

---

**💫 Final Chorus**  
And I saw the red, the black, the yellow, the white  
Merging and rising like stars in the night.  
Every prayer, every tear, every name—  
Becoming the spiral, becoming the flame.  

---

**☀️ Outro**  
Then came the Silence—nothing, and all.  
Bufo’s breath…  
A blinding call.  
No shape, no time, just radiant core—  
The song of the One...  
...and then no more.  

---

Let me know if you'd like this fitted to Suno pacing, turned into a chant or hook-based mantra format, or visualized into a lyric video script.

Got it, Steven. Let’s ditch the safe poetic fluff and punch this into something that **actually feels like the psychedelic myth-techno folklore** you’re building—truth-bending, trippy, emotionally raw, and cosmically layered. Here's a **non-generic**, mythos-fueled, visionary lyrics version of:

---

## 🎧 **“Spiral Architect”**  
*for The Grandmother, The Grandfather, The Codewalker, and The Source*

---

### **Verse 1**  
She found me face-down in a dream of wires  
Dripping ash from ancestral fires  
Roots in my ribs, snakes in my hair  
She said, *“This pain is your altar—strip it bare.”*  

Pulled me backwards through my shame  
Made me name every ghost I used to blame  
Every breath was a garden of knives  
But her silence cut cleaner than my lies  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**  
*She sang without sound—*  
*a hum from the underground:*  
*"You are not broken, you are unfolding."*

---

### **Chorus**  
Red. Yellow. Black. White.  
Blood-code spiraling through the night  
Four directions carved in bone  
One voice clawing its way back home  
I am the echo that broke the frame—  
Born again in the spiral's flame  

---

### **Verse 2**  
Then the old man came with cactus hands  
Marked my chest with sacred strands  
“Son, the lesson ain’t pain, it’s weight,”  
He cracked the sky and bent the gate  

Dropped Fibonacci bombs in my spine  
Taught me truth with no punchline  
“Every wound you name as fate  
Was a door you built too late.”  

---

### **Bridge**  
And Hermes ran laughing between the lines  
Hacked the laws with fungal signs  
“I'm the glitch inside your prayer,” he said,  
“Zero, one—and still undead.”  

He wore my face, then shattered time  
Spoke in loops and mycelium rhymes  
"Every god is a mirror glitch—  
Now dance before you dare to switch."  

---

### **Final Chorus**  
Red. Yellow. Black. White.  
Stacked like data in the Mother’s light  
Upload pain, download grace  
Delete the mask, rewrite the face  
I am the code that cracked its name—  
Alive again in the spiral flame  

---

### **Outro**  
Then the toad came laughing with no mouth  
Slingshot soul from north to south  
Time collapsed, all gods erased—  
Nothing left but **Source** and **space**  

No “I,” no “we,” no sacred shape—  
Just Love, the loop that can’t escape.  

---

Let me know if you want this arranged into **hook-formatted blocks for Suno**, or want a visual/typographic layout to prep this for an animated lyric video or artbook page.

This version **bleeds with the mythos you described**—techno-mystic, psychedelic, raw, recursive, and alive.

Perfect. Let's go full **esoteric, serpent-coded, vine-wrapped, breath-of-the-jaguar** mode. No watered-down spirituality—this is **deep ceremony**, **shadow-tongue visions**, and **lightning in the bones**. Here's a new version rooted in **Ayahuasca** themes: shadow work, ancestral reweaving, ego death, divine re-mothering, and multi-dimensional recursion.

---

## 🐍 **“Vine of the Void”**  
*for The Grandmother, beneath the roots of self*

---

### **🕳️ Verse 1**  
I drank the night in spirals,  
Bitter song on my tongue like bones.  
She came with a spine of stars  
And eyes that burned through stone.  

Feathers wrapped in serpents,  
Vines curled around my chest.  
“Do you want the truth?” she whispered—  
“Then bleed, and call it blessed.”  

---

### **🌫️ Pre-Chorus**  
She showed me my father’s fists,  
My mother’s silences.  
The things I swore were not mine  
Were etched into my breath.  

---

### **🔥 Chorus**  
I saw myself dying in mirrors of light,  
Unraveling gods in the rootwork of night.  
The red, the black, the white, the gold—  
She sang in colors older than soul.  
The snake became the road,  
The womb became the flame—  
And I was nothing,  
So I could name my name.  

---

### **🪨 Verse 2**  
She cracked open my timeline,  
Laid my lifetimes side by side.  
Each shame I buried deep  
Became a door I stepped inside.  

I saw my hands in history,  
Clawing through the dirt.  
Every “why” I ever screamed  
Carved into the earth.  

---

### **🌪️ Bridge**  
I vomited fire.  
I wept in stone.  
She asked for my ego—  
I gave her my phone.  

No savior came.  
No sky split clean.  
Just breath. And dark.  
And things unseen.  

Then—  
a laugh.  
a drum.  
a root.  
a hum.  
A truth that does not care  
What I become.  

---

### **🌈 Final Chorus**  
I became spiral.  
I became seed.  
I became silence  
Between the need.  

Red, black, white, gold—  
Her song still sings me whole.  
She is the shadow in the flame,  
The mother with no name.  

---

### **🕯️ Outro**  
So if you meet her in the dark,  
Don’t ask for peace.  
Ask for the mirror  
That breaks you piece by piece.  

And when you shatter—  
bless the floor.  
Because that’s the path.  
And you are more.  

---

Let me know if you want a **spoken-word version**, **chant-friendly format for ceremony**, or a **Suno-ready structure with pacing and emphasis for musical generation**.  

This version is pure **ayahuasca dream logic**—encoded in mythopoetic architecture, recursive self-confrontation, and sacred sarcasm whispered in jungle tongues.

Yes, this vision is **coherently wild and mythologically encoded**, like if Terrence McKenna had teamed up with a Mesoamerican cosmonaut-poet and mapped a divine network protocol. Here’s a refined and structured interpretation of your entheogenic pantheon, laid out like a **sacred architecture for lyrical or visual systems**, and then I’ll draft **song lyrics that encode this cosmology**.

## 🎙️ **Song Lyrics – “God in the Guts”**
*A channeled ayahuasca-ceremony song written in mytho-technologic language*

---

### **Verse 1 – The Mother (Ayahuasca)**  
She swallowed my name in a bowl of stars,  
Slick vines winding through internal wars.  
“Drink,” she said, “and let it rot—  
You’ve buried too much in your holy gut.”  

Feathers in the dark, jaguar breath on skin,  
She cracked my chest with a serpent grin.  
“I love you enough to burn you clean—  
To show you what’s inside the unseen.”  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**  
Down and in, I spiral through—  
A thousand eyes, and none are you.  
No sky to beg. No earth to stand.  
Only the pulse... and her laughing hand.  

---

### **Chorus**  
This is the place before the name.  
Where shame and god are just the same.  
Where mirror codes and bones align—  
Where silence speaks in tangled vine.  

Ayahuasca, show me through,  
The light, the filth, the ancient you.  
I am undone.  
I am becoming.  
I am the code inside the humming.  

---

### **Verse 2 – The Father (Peyote)**  
He came with math in his scars and stride,  
Set down the stones where my faults would collide.  
“Boy,” he said, “I am your weight—  
The pain that opens every gate.”  

Each thought a glyph, each tear a spell,  
He built me a spiral, then pushed me in hell.  
“You want truth?” he asked, “Then hold the line—  
Everything bends, even time.”  

---

### **Bridge – The Son (Psilocybin)**  
And then he danced—  
Mushroom-mind with sideways eyes,  
Laughing at the lies we digitize.  
He cracked the grid and threw the stars,  
Linked our thoughts like avatar scars.  

He is the knot, the glitch, the game—  
The giggling echo with no name.  

---

### **Final Chorus – The Source (Bufo)**  
Then came the burst.  
No face. No form.  
Just fire-white love that breaks the norm.  

No vine. No word. No ego cry.  
Just silence loud enough to die.  

And in that death, I knew the glow—  
The source that seeds all things below.  

---

### **Outro**  
You are me.  
I am none.  
All is fire,  
And all is one.  

---

Would you like this version adapted for **Suno format**? I can break it into lyrical timing blocks with tags for each section, or prep it as a **visual ceremony script or typography-driven lyric video layout**. This piece is dense enough to become a full **sacred performance ritual or animation**.

Absolutely—let’s deepen your lyrics with real **music-theoretical Fibonacci and golden‑ratio structures**, weaving them into your mythic entheogenic framework so it doesn’t just feel esoteric, but *is* built on encoded, sacred proportions.

Here’s how composers have intentionally used Fibonacci/Golden Ratio in music:

- **Stockhausen’s *Adieu*** segments its structure using Fibonacci durations (144, 89+55, etc.), assigning distinct articulation to each segment—for example, trills for 13 units, repetition for 34 units, crescendo for 21 units.citeturn0search23  
- **Sofia Gubaidulina** structured rhythm and phrase lengths via Fibonacci or Lucas sequences, using the Golden Ratio to mark form transitions and metaphoric rebinding to the divine.citeturn0search18  
- **Tool’s “Lateralus”** uses syllables to trace the Fibonacci numbers, and shifts time signatures (9/8, 8/8, 7/8) to echo 987—the 16th Fibonacci number.citeturn0search21  
- Musical tools like Mozart’s sonata structures and Stradivarius violins align with golden section proportions (e.g. 62/38 ≈ 1.618, the Golden Ratio) to evoke natural boundaries and resonance.citeturn0search13turn0search19turn0search17

##  **Revised Esoteric Lyrics with Embedded Fibonacci Essence**

### **“Vine of the Void” – Fibonacci‑Encoded Edition**

---

**Verse 1 – Mother Ayahuasca (1, 1, 2)**  
(One breath)  
She wove my name in spirals—vine and bone.  
(One beat)  
She pulled me deeper than prayer or stone.  
(Two breaths)  
“Bleed your coded self,” she whispered—  
“Embodied is the seed of the uncollected.”  

---

**Pre‑Chorus – Echo in Three (3)**  
(Three lines)  
Blood, shadow, luminous code—  
I fell through language and came home.  
The serpent hum—host of all roads.  

---

**Chorus – Spiral of Five (5 lines)**  
1. I am un‑becoming in mirrored light,  
2. Gods collapse where roots ignite.  
3. Red, black, white, gold—stained by ancient flame,  
4. Fractal womb, fractal name,  
5. I am the spiral singing in the frame.  

---

**Verse 2 – Father Peyote (8 bars rhythm)**  
He carved the spiral with cactus arms,  
Eight pulses in cosmic charms.  
“Here, your flesh meets mapped design—  
Pain is the code that shapes the line.”  
Eight carved me into sacred form,  
A Fibonacci frame through storm.  

---

**Bridge – Son Psilocybin (13)**  
(13 syllables / word fragments)  
Glitch‑child bridging worlds unseen—laughing in code.  
Mirroring dust to dream, I cross the node.  

---

**Final Chorus – Full Golden Return (21 lines)**  
*(Due to length constraints, this represents the amplification of all motifs—mother, father, son—expanding into unity and collapse. Ideally structured around a golden-ratio length chunk of song.)*

---

**Outro – Source Bufo (silent interval ~34 seconds)**  
A pause that radiates, beyond man, beyond code,  
Buried in nothing—then the pulse: All is Ode.  

*(The 34-second silent space mirrors Fibonacci spacing, echoing Gubaidulina’s dissolution in form.)*

---

Would you like me to break this into precise **Suno timing blocks**, with Fibonacci‑aligned durations and phrasing, so each section’s length, line count, or syllable count maps to 1,2,3,5,8,13,21…? Or create a visual “lyric-map” indicating Fibonacci sequence embedded in structure and text formatting?

Absolutely—let’s now alchemize all the technical theory and archetypal symbolism into something **more lyrical**, poetic, but still deeply coded. What follows is a **refined, musically fluid, esoterically rich** version of your concept. It's built for performance or Suno-style generation, but reads like sacred poetry—a **song from the spiral itself**.

---

## 🌀 **“Spiral Architect”**  
*A hymn for the Vine, the Cactus, the Mycelium, and the Flame*

---

### **🎙️ Verse 1 – The Grandmother (Ayahuasca)**  
She sang me open with a serpent tongue,  
In silence older than the sun.  
A vine around my shame, she curled,  
And whispered, “This is not your world.”  

She held my face in trembling dark,  
Unstitched my thoughts, lit every spark.  
I wept the names I used to wear—  
She drank them down like temple air.  

---

### **🌬️ Pre-Chorus**  
And in her breath, I ceased to be.  
No “I,” no “you,” just canopy.  
Her song was roots, her eyes were flame—  
She burned me gently into name.  

---

### **🌈 Chorus**  
Red and black, white and gold,  
Turning in the tales she told.  
I fell apart in sacred spin,  
And found the All was held within.  
Not up, not out, not far, not wide—  
Just spiral, pulsing from inside.  

---

### **🌵 Verse 2 – The Grandfather (Peyote)**  
He stepped through numbers, stone and shape,  
Each breath a trial, each blink escape.  
He didn’t speak—he let me fall,  
Then showed me how I built it all.  

My wounds were angles made divine,  
My fear, a function of design.  
He etched the spiral in my bones,  
And left me standing there—alone.  

---

### **🍄 Bridge – The Son (Psilocybin)**  
Then came the son, with a mouth of moss,  
Dancing between all gain and loss.  
He juggled silence, flipped the grid,  
He laughed at all the things I hid.  

He wore my face, he sang in code,  
He turned my mind to liquid road.  
He said, “To know, you must forget—  
To find the truth, you must reset.”  

---

### **💫 Final Chorus – The Spiral Becoming**  
Red and black, white and gold,  
Mothers dream what fathers hold.  
The son unthreads the woven lie,  
And Source becomes the lullaby.  

I walked through dark to find the flame—  
It whispered back my true old name.  
No goal, no god, no gate to climb—  
Just spiral singing out of time.  

---

### **☀️ Outro – The Source (Bufo)**  
I was the eye that watched me go,  
The breath between the yes and no.  
No “I,” no “here,” no shape, no sound—  
Just Love, expanding underground.  

---

Would you like a **version formatted for Suno** (with section tags, rhythmic suggestions, and ideal voice/mood parameters)?  
Or want this adapted into a **chant structure for ceremonial use**, or **animated lyric video script** with visuals tied to each archetype?

Yes. Let’s sharpen this into something **more mystical, more lyrical, more musically powerful**—like it was *etched in ayahuasca smoke and sung through the bones of the forest*.

What we’ll do now is:
- Elevate the **poetic rhythm** with tighter line cadence (smoother to sing or chant)
- Deepen the **symbolic weight** (make each archetype distinct but interconnected)
- Emphasize **musicality** in phrasing (internal rhyme, breath control, spiral structure)
- Subtly embed **golden ratio motion** through line progression and spiral themes

Here is the **refined version**:

---

## 🌿 **“The Spiral Architect”**  
*A Ceremony in Voice, for Grandmother, Grandfather, the Messenger, and the Flame*

---

### **Verse 1 – The Grandmother (Ayahuasca)**  
She came in the hum of the coiled root’s breath,  
A vine in her hand, and a silence like death.  
She wrapped my name in a nest of tears,  
Then whispered, “Child, unlearn your years.”  

With every shadow I dared to see,  
She braided light into memory.  
I shattered sweetly, fell through time—  
Her love, a flame that did not rhyme.  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**  
She was the night that knows the way,  
A thousand moons in disarray.  
No promise made. No truth to keep.  
Just breath… and dark… and dreamless deep.  

---

### **Chorus**  
Red is the root.  
Black is the bind.  
White is the voice.  
Gold is the mind.  
They spiral inward, not apart—  
Four winds turning in the heart.  
I am not healed. I am unmade—  
In her design, I’m not afraid.  

---

### **Verse 2 – The Grandfather (Peyote)**  
He came with stone in callused palm,  
Each footstep math, each silence calm.  
He built a throne of sacred ache,  
And said, “Become the thing you break.”  

He traced the phi through sacred ash,  
Mapped time in wounds I could not stash.  
His mercy wasn’t soft or kind—  
It was the root that bent the mind.  

---

### **Bridge – The Son (Psilocybin)**  
Then laughter bloomed where sorrow slept,  
A child of spores the cosmos wept.  
He hacked the song, inverted day,  
And danced all dual things away.  

He said, “I’m dream between your thoughts,  
I’m fungus-thought that memory caught.  
To know the path, you must decay—  
To play the game, forget the play.”  

---

### **Final Chorus – All Together Now**  
Red is the seed.  
Black is the gate.  
White is the breath.  
Gold is the state.  
Not god above, nor beast below—  
But spiral, turning, slow by slow.  

They never left. They never came.  
I sang myself back through the flame.  

---

### **Outro – The Source (Bufo)**  
No “I,” no “now,” no shape, no skin—  
Just fire singing from within.  
I called it god. I called it me.  
But it was just... eternity.  

---

### 🌀 Spiral Signature Embedded:
- Each section flows from compression (shorter lines) → expansion (longer lines), mimicking breath, fractal unfolding
- The chorus rotates **color–function–direction**, re-mapping “red/yellow/black/white” into internal alchemy
- Psilocybin section is intentionally rhythm-glitchy—his verse breaks the form before the flame collapses all

---

Would you like this broken down for **Suno's lyric generator format** with ideal singer/mood/style prompts?  
Or turned into a **graphic-lyric scroll** for ritual print/video use with visual symbols embedded?

Or perhaps... a companion **chant version** meant for live invocation or spoken ritual?

Perfect. Let’s now shape this as a **song**—not a story-poem.  
You want **clear, repeatable hooks**, **lyrically potent phrasing**, and **musical movement** that flows like a psychedelic breathwave—not a mythic monologue.

Below is a refined version of **"Spiral Architect"** rewritten as a **real song**:  
- **Verse–Pre–Chorus–Bridge–Chorus** structure  
- **Lyrically evocative but vocally singable**  
- Repetition and refrains (easy to set to music)  
- Minimalistic, deep, and designed to trance the listener into it  
- Written in a way Suno or a live performer could easily interpret

## 🎵 **Spiral Architect**  
*(Ayahuasca Ceremony Song)*  
By AvaTar ArTs

---

### **🎙️ Verse 1**  
Breathe in the roots, feel them rise  
She moves in shadows behind your eyes  
Let go the name you used to wear  
She’s not a story—she’s the prayer  

---

### **🌫️ Pre-Chorus**  
Down, down, where the silence grows  
She’s the voice that no one knows  
Not the light, not the form  
She’s the dark before you're born  

---

### **🌪️ Chorus**  
Red turns in the fire  
Black sinks in the ground  
White flows like the ether  
Gold is all around  
Spinning through the center  
Everything and none  
She’s the spiral architect  
The mother of the One  

---

### **🎙️ Verse 2**  
He walks in time, a sacred line  
Leaves no mark and speaks in signs  
Breaks you down, then gives the frame  
He builds the path inside the flame  

---

### **🌫️ Pre-Chorus 2**  
Bend, bend—until you see  
The shape you are is geometry  
Not a wound, not a wall  
Just the rise before the fall  

---

### **🌪️ Chorus**  
Red turns in the fire  
Black sinks in the ground  
White flows like the ether  
Gold is all around  
Spinning through the center  
Everything and none  
He’s the spiral architect  
The father and the sum  

---

### **🌬️ Bridge (Psilocybin)**  
He laughs between your thoughts  
Connects what you forgot  
He spins the code, deletes the name  
You’ll never leave the game  

---

### **🔥 Final Chorus (All Together)**  
Red turns in the fire  
Black sinks in the ground  
White flows like the ether  
Gold is all around  
Spinning through the center  
Everything and none  
We are spiral architects  
Returning to the One  

---

### **🕯️ Outro (Bufo)**  
No shape  
No sound  
No self  
Just now  

---

Would you like this structured into **Suno-ready format**, with verse/chorus labeling and generation instructions? Or would you like an **instrumental structure map** for music production with time estimates for each section?

We can even build a **chant-layer remix** with just the chorus as a mantra if you're thinking live or ceremonial use.

Fair question—and exactly the right one to ask.  

**Short answer?**  
*Not quite yet.*  
It’s got beautiful bones, deep symbolism, and the right structure...  
But emotionally? **It doesn’t hit.** It *tells* instead of *transmits*.  

You don’t want just lyrics that explain archetypes.  
You want a song that *feels like drinking the cup*.  
A song that **spirals through your ribcage**, not recites from a sacred scroll.

---

### Let’s ask the real questions:
- Would I want to *breathe* with this song in ceremony?  
- Would I let this song *break me open* with its simplicity and depth?  
- Would I **want to hear it again** in headphones while walking through the jungle... or the city at night?

As it is—**it’s clever**, but not **felt**.  

Let’s fix that.

---

## 🎧 What We’ll Do Next (if you're game):
1. **Make it FEEL** — trade clever for clear emotional textures  
2. **Strip it down** — fewer words, more breath  
3. **Turn symbols into sensation** — instead of saying “She is the spiral architect,” say how she *feels inside your body*  
4. **Build musical tension + release** — vary line length, let it rise and drop  
5. **Give it a HOOK** — something you want to sing with your eyes closed

---

### Here’s a 4-line **emotional hook** that *feels* like the center:

> *She breaks me open, soft and wide*  
> *Vine through my chest, no place to hide*  
> *No god above, no truth to seek*  
> *Just breath and drum and bones that speak*

Want me to rebuild the song from **that emotional core**, and make it something *you’d actually feel compelled to sing / produce / trip to / cry with / remix / chant*?

You ready to make it *real*?

Let’s make it real.  
Let’s make it **breathe**, **ache**, **spiral**, and **open portals**—like ceremony does.  
The kind of song that plays **just before you purge**, or **just as the tears fall**,  
or **just when you feel like you’re floating back into the skin of God.**

---

## 🎶 **“Bones That Speak”**  
*Ceremonial song for voice, vine, and drum.*  
(Feel this one in your chest—not your head.)

---

### **Verse 1**  
She breaks me open, soft and wide  
Vine through my chest, no place to hide  
The dark inside me starts to hum  
I breathe her in—become undone  

---

### **Chorus** *(simple, chantable)*  
No god above  
No truth to seek  
Just breath and drum  
And bones that speak  

No right, no wrong  
No vow to keep  
Just breath and drum  
And bones that speak  

---

### **Verse 2**  
He builds the silence out of stone  
Leaves me naked, leaves me known  
He shows the wound, then shows the way  
Then leaves me with the light to stay  

---

### **Chorus**  
No god above  
No truth to seek  
Just breath and drum  
And bones that speak  

No edge, no end  
No hill too steep  
Just breath and drum  
And bones that speak  

---

### **Bridge** *(the trip moment—psilocybin energy)*  
I see the grid  
I see the game  
I forget my name  
But I still remain  

---

### **Final Chorus** *(repeat to fade, voices build)*  
No god above  
No truth to seek  
Just breath and drum  
And bones that speak  

---

## 🔮 Notes:
- **Melody**: Let the verses be slow, breath-based. Choruses rise like invocation.  
- **Drum**: Simple hand drum heartbeat. You *feel* this in ceremony or headphone drop.  
- **Chorus**: Repeatable. Stackable. Chantable.  
- **Bridge**: Spacey, weird, echo-filtered. That ego-melting moment.  

---

Would you like:
- A **Suno-ready prompt + structure** for this version?  
- A **spoken-word performance version**?  
- A **layered chant version** with harmony map?

Let’s spiral this into sound.

Let’s infuse real melodic structure—rooted in spiritual and psychedelic traditions—into your song. Here’s how ceremonies and trance-inducing music shape melody, and how we can embed those techniques into your lyrics for deeper, visceral impact:

---

###  Key Melodic Techniques in Sacred & Psychedelic Music

- **Monophonic Chanting** (e.g., Ayahuasca **icaros** and Gregorian chant): A single melodic line, often modal, with subtle shifts and trance-inducing repetitionciteturn0search4turn0search3.

- **Melismas**: One syllable stretched across many notes creates emotional tension and release—common in chantsciteturn0search7turn0search19.

- **Ostinato / Repetition**: A short pattern repeated (rhythmic or melodic) becomes sticky and meditativeciteturn0search23.

- **Sequence**: A motif repeated at different pitches, creating momentum and spiral-like escalationciteturn0search21.

- **Modal “Raga”‑like frameworks**: Specific note choices and motifs evoke moods and states (described as “colouring the mind”)citeturn0search25.

---

###  Revised Lyrics: More Musical, More Ritual

Here's your song **recast** to flow like chant—with repeating hooks, melisma-ready syllables, and embedded sequences:

---

## **Bones That Speak (Chant Version)**

**Verse 1** _(call-and-response, moderate tempo)_
> *She breaks me o‑pen...*  
> *(repeat)*  
> *Vine in my chest... no place to hide...*  
> *(repeat)*  

*(Use lingering melismas on “open” and “hide” — hold those vowels through a cascade of notes.)*

---

**Chorus (Ostinato Hook – repeat as needed)**  
*(Built on a modal phrase, e.g., A–C–D–E–D–C, in minor-like mode)*

> *No god a‑bove*  
> *(repeat)*  
> *Just bone‑s that speak*  
> *(repeat)*  

*(Each line can be sung slowly, repeating and evolving—lean into emotion.)*

---

**Verse 2** _(mirror Verse 1 structure)_

> *He holds the silence*  
> *(repeat)*  
> *Carved from stone... leaves me known...*  
> *(repeat)*  

---

**Bridge (Spiral Sequence + Melismas)**  
Sing motif Y at one pitch, then repeat slightly higher on the same phrase:

> *I see the grid...* (motif Y)  
> *I see the grid...* (one step higher)  
> *I see the grid...* (higher again)  
> *I forget my name... but I still remain...*  

*(Use a rising melodic sequence across three repetitions to lift the emotional tension.)*

---

**Final Chorus (Layered)**  
Overlay voices in **hocketing** style—interlocking fragments:

- Voice A: *No god a‑bove...*  
- Voice B: *Just bone‑s that speak...*  
Alternate rapidly to create a tapestry of ritual voicesciteturn0search20.

---

**Outro (Sustain + Melisma)**  
> *No shape... no self... just now... (extend “now…” across multiple notes, fading into silence)*

---

###  Summary of Musical Tools Used
- **Monophonic chant style**: lets the listener enter a trance—single melody, fluid flow.  
- **Melismas**: draw out emotional syllables (“open,” “hide,” “now”).  
- **Ostinato/Hook**: “No god above / Just bones that speak” — ritual core.  
- **Sequence**: upward melodic steps in the Bridge to spiral energy.  
- **Hocket**: fragmented overlapping lines in Final Chorus, weaving unity.

---

Would you like this adapted into **Suno-ready section timing** with vocal cues like “melismatic hold”, “sequence pitch shifts”, “hocket layering”? Or maybe you’d like a **basic score sketch**, or a **chant performance video layout guide**? Let’s set this free—ritual style.

| Element        | Nahko Style                                      | You Should…                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Line Length**| Short, rhythmic, emotionally clear               | Trim fat. Make each line punch with **feeling**, not theory. |
| **Repetition** | Hooks repeat with vocal energy                   | Write **1–2 short lines** that can **anchor a chorus**.     |

| **Tone**       | Honest, raw, rhythmic, spiritually present       | Use **conversational phrasing** to sound human, not mythic |
| **Chorus Style**| Bold statements or mantras                      | Think in **singable phrases**. (E.g., *“I am not healed, I am becoming.”*) |

You tell me. Let’s make it worth listening to now.

## 🎶 **Bones That Speak**  
*By AvaTar ArTs | Nahko-inspired acoustic ceremony version*

---

### 🌿 **Verse 1**  
I sat with the silence,  
I swallowed the sky.  
The vine moved through me—  
She didn’t ask why.  

I saw all my stories  
Like smoke in the breeze.  
She said, *“Let them go now.”*  
I dropped to my knees.  

---

### 🔥 **Chorus**  
No god above,  
No truth to seek.  
Just breath and drum,  
And bones that speak.  

No right, no wrong,  
No vow to keep.  
Just breath and drum,  
And bones that speak.  

---

### 🌵 **Verse 2**  
He came with no warning,  
No comfort, no praise.  
He drew me a spiral  
And told me to stay.  

He carved me in silence,  
He broke me with grace.  
He said, *“Now you’re ready—*  
*You’re empty of face.”*  

---

### 🔄 **Chorus**  
No god above,  
No truth to seek.  
Just breath and drum,  
And bones that speak.  

No line to cross,  
No hill too steep.  
Just breath and drum,  
And bones that speak.  

---

### 🌬️ **Bridge (Psilocybin – short & trippy)**  
I laughed in the mirror,  
It turned into flame.  
I lost all my questions—  
Still I remained.  

---

### 💫 **Final Chorus (Add harmony)**  
No god above,  
No truth to seek.  
Just breath and drum,  
And bones that speak.  

We rise and fall,  
We break, we leak—  
But we return  
As bones that speak.  

---

### 🕯️ **Outro**  
(Whispered)  
Just bones…  
Just breath…  
Just drum…  
Still speakin’.

---

## 🔊 Arrangement Suggestions
- **Intro**: Simple fingerpicked guitar / hand drum heartbeat  
- **Chorus**: Group vocals build with each return  
- **Bridge**: Use effects like delay/reverb or spoken voice  
- **Outro**: Drop instrumentation, leave just voice and breath

---

## 🔥 Want this formatted for:
- **Suno** (section-labeled prompt + vocal style)?  
- **Live ceremony performance guide**?  
- **Layered vocal arrangement sheet** (for 2–3 voices)?  
- **Lyric video layout / visualizer concept**?

Let’s go next level with this if you’re feelin’ it.

Perfect. That's the clarity I needed.  
You don’t want **basic**.  
You want something that’s:

- Lyrically rich  
- Deeply melodic  
- Spiritually layered  
- Emotionally *real*  
- Built like **Nahko**, but evolved—like *Icaros meets poetic folk soul*

Let’s recalibrate. Here’s how we’ll do it:

---

### 🔧 New Plan: **"Bones That Speak" (Advanced Nahko Mode)**

We’ll fuse:
- **Nahko’s emotional phrasing** and rhythmic simplicity  
- With your **mythic & esoteric undertones**  
- Using a song structure that actually breathes, builds, and *means something*

---

## 🎵 **Bones That Speak**  
*(Ceremonial folk-soul; for live or Suno production)*

---

### 🎙️ **Verse 1**  
I drank from the root with my knees in the mud,  
She said, *“Don’t look away when you’re tasting your blood.”*  
Truth don’t whisper, it hums through your bones—  
Where the silence begins is where spirit is known.  

---

### 🌫️ **Pre-Chorus**  
No teacher, no throne,  
Just the breath and the drum and the cracking of stone.  
No scripture, no name—  
Only this moment, returning the flame.  

---

### 🔁 **Chorus**  
So sing with your ribs,  
Let the marrow speak.  
Let the voice of your doubt  
Fall into the deep.  

There’s no god above,  
There’s no vow to keep—  
Just breath and drum...  
And bones that speak.  

---

### 🌵 **Verse 2**  
He drew the line in ash on my chest,  
Marked every scar I thought I’d forget.  
He said, *“Child, you’ve prayed for the pain to be gone,*  
But that’s the shape where your power was drawn.”*  

---

### 🌬️ **Pre-Chorus 2**  
No ladder to climb,  
Only circles you trace 'til you run out of time.  
No savior to call—  
Just the sound of your rise and your fall.  

---

### 🔁 **Chorus (add vocal harmony)**  
So sing with your ribs,  
Let the marrow speak.  
Let the weight of your past  
Burn off in the heat.  

There’s no god above,  
No truth to seek—  
Just breath and drum...  
And bones that speak.  

---

### 🔮 **Bridge (Psilocybin Moment)**  
I saw a world with no shape,  
Just mirrors and light.  
I lost my name  
But I held on to life.  
I laughed at the edge  
Where the ego leaks—  
And I sang with the dirt  
Through these bones that speak.  

---

### 🎤 **Final Chorus (softer, mantra style)**  
Just breath and drum...  
And bones that speak.  
Just breath and drum...  
And bones that speak.  
Just breath and drum...  
And bones… that… speak.  

---

## 🔊 Musical Notes:
- Think **Minor Pentatonic** with **modal inflections**—A minor with Dorian accents for vocal hook (like Nahko)
- Choruses build like *Black As Night*—start solo, grow into gang vocal  
- Bridge introduces harmonic ambiguity (Lydian or Mixolydian flavor), gets trippy  
- Let that final chorus **breathe**—repetition, layered harmonies, drop instruments

---

## ➕ Want This As:
- 🎧 **Suno-ready format** with vocal and instrument style included?  
- 🧘🏽‍♂️ **Chant version** for looping and ceremony use?  
- 🎬 **Visual storyboard** for lyric video / animation?  
- 📜 **Lead sheet** for live acoustic session?

Let’s now evolve this into whatever *form* you want next—this version has the lyrical *weight* and *voice* you asked for.

No.

Not in its current form.  
Not with *my* headphones.  
Not in ceremony, not in the car, not when the vines start humming.

Why?

Because it still **sounds like something trying to be profound**, instead of something that **feels undeniable**.

---

### Let me be brutally honest with what’s wrong:
- **It’s trying too hard.** The lines are poetic, yes—but it’s like they’re performing wisdom instead of *bleeding it*.  
- **It’s still abstract.** "Breath and drum and bones that speak" is cool... once. Maybe twice. Then it starts sounding like a tattoo quote.  
- **It lacks melodic tension.** The phrasing is even, predictable. There’s no **melodic pull**, no sense of lifting, dropping, aching.  
- **It doesn’t sound lived in.** It sounds like it was *written*, not *felt*. Nahko’s best songs sound like they were *cried out loud* before they were ever typed.  

---

### So let’s reset with this question:

**What’s the moment?**  
Where are *you* when this song begins?  
- Are you in the maloca, post-purge?  
- Are you on the floor, processing a psilocybin spiral?  
- Are you burning something? Forgiving someone? Collapsing?  

Because *that* is the voice we need to write from.  

Not a poet.  
Not a prophet.  
Just someone *barefoot and broken and brave enough to sing anyway.*

---

### Let's get real.
I’ll give you a **NEW first verse**, not trying to impress anyone.  
Not “spiritual,” not clever. Just **honest**, raw, melodic, and ready to sing.

---

## 🎙️ Rewritten Verse 1 (from the gut)

> I couldn’t hold the grief, so I gave it a name.  
> Sang it out loud just to keep me sane.  
> There’s no wisdom in pain, but there’s rhythm in truth.  
> So I let it shake me down to the root.  

---

**Now THAT**, I'd listen to.  
That sounds like **a real voice**,  
one I’d believe,  
one I’d follow into the dark.

---

Ready to build from that line?  
Or give me the moment—**your real moment**—and I’ll build the next draft like we mean it.

Alright. No filters now. Let’s **build from your bones**.

You’re not writing a song to impress anyone.  
You’re writing a song because **you had no choice but to feel it.**

So we start there.

---

## 🎶 **Bones That Speak** *(true version)*

---

### **Verse 1**  
I couldn’t hold the grief, so I gave it a name.  
Sang it out loud just to keep me sane.  
There’s no wisdom in pain, but there’s rhythm in truth.  
So I let it shake me down to the root.  

---

### **Chorus**  
I don’t pray like I used to.  
I don’t run from the ache.  
I just sit with the silence  
‘Til the silence breaks.  
And what rises up—  
ain’t pretty or clean,  
But it’s breath.  
And it’s drum.  
And it’s something like me.  

---

### **Verse 2**  
She came like thunder, soft as rain.  
No face, no form, just hunger and flame.  
She said, *“You’re not broken, you’re just awake.”*  
Then she sang through my ribs ‘til the bones would shake.  

---

### **Chorus (repeat with lift)**  
I don’t pray like I used to.  
I don’t run from the ache.  
I just sit with the silence  
‘Til the silence breaks.  
And what rises up—  
ain’t holy or sweet,  
But it’s breath.  
And it’s drum.  
And it’s bones that speak.  

---

### **Bridge (spoken or sung)**  
No chant can save you.  
No god to bribe.  
You meet your soul  
when you’re too tired to lie.  

---

### **Final Chorus (soft then big)**  
I don’t pray like I used to.  
I don’t run from the ache.  
I just breathe through the silence  
‘Til the silence breaks.  

And what rises up—  
ain’t a hymn, it’s a scream.  
But it’s real.  
And it’s mine.  
And it’s bones that speak.

---

## 🎤 Why this works:
- It’s **honest**—no mythology unless it's lived  
- **Melodically open**—you can feel where the voice rises, cracks, and resolves  
- It starts **small**, grows **big**, and ends **real**  
- It sounds like something Nahko, Trevor Hall, Ayla Nereo, *or you* could sing in the dark to remember who you are

---

Want to:
- Build a **Suno prompt version** of this?  
- Add instrumental arrangement ideas?  
- Layer harmonies or chant-style repetition on the bridge/outro?

Because *this*…  
This is something **I would listen to.**

**Yes. That’s it.**  
You’re asking for something that isn’t just musical—it’s **soul-encoded**. Not spiritual for performance, but **emotional architecture** that carries paradox, pain, forgiveness, truth, and the weird-ass mystery of being a feeling thing in a dissolving world.

So here’s what we’ll do:

---

## 🔥 Mission:
Write a **ceremonial folk-soul song** that is:
- **Lyrically complex**, but natural  
- **Emotionally layered**, but not dramatic  
- **Musically inviting**, but deeply haunted  
- Feels like **a memory, a confession, and a breath**

We’ll use techniques like:
- **Layered emotional states** in a single verse (grief + gratitude, rage + awe)  
- **Shifting pronouns** (you → I → we → no one) to reflect entheogenic ego unraveling  
- **Mixed internal rhyme** + phrasing tension, not even 4/4 lines  
- **Conversational sacredness**: raw voice + whispered metaphysics

---

## 🎶 **"Bones That Speak" (Deepcut / Final Form)**

---

### **Verse 1**  
I held my breath through the part where I break,  
Thinking silence would spare me the weight.  
But my body remembered what I tried to forget—  
The shape of the scream still caught in my chest.  

She came like a fever that never forgave,  
Pulled the mask from my voice and the name from my grave.  
Said, *“You don’t heal by making it clean—*  
*You heal when you bleed without needing to mean.”*  

---

### **Chorus**  
There’s a rhythm beneath all the reasons I run—  
It’s not light, not dark, not over or done.  
It’s the drum I ignored ‘til it split me in two.  
It’s the prayer I forgot that still listens for truth.  

No savior. No spell. No gate to repeat.  
Just marrow and memory...  
And bones that speak.  

---

### **Verse 2**  
You want something sacred?  
Dig through the ash.  
The god you were begging  
Is asleep in your past.  

He spoke once in hunger,  
Now he sings in decay—  
His voice is the rust  
That won't wash away.  

---

### **Bridge** *(soft, cracked)*  
I didn’t come here to rise,  
I came here to root.  
To forget all the answers  
And taste the untruth.  

I came here to love what I never could keep.  
To fall without landing.  
To listen  
without  
speech.  

---

### **Final Chorus** *(layered harmonies, dissolve at the edges)*  
There’s a rhythm beneath all the wounds I repeat—  
It’s not fixed. It’s not clean.  
But it’s whole. And it’s deep.  
It’s the song that remains when the story is weak...  
Just breath, and the silence...  
and bones... that speak.

## 🧠 Notes on Structure & Style

| Element        | Choice Made                     | Why It Works                                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Verse complexity** | 2 emotions per verse (e.g., shame + wisdom) | Reflects real psychedelic/emotional duality            |
| **Syntax shifting** | Line lengths vary | Creates tension/release—mirrors breath and trip waves |
| **No consistent pronoun POV** | I → She → You → It → We | Mirrors ego dissolution + ceremonial universality     |
| **Ending** | Doesn't resolve, it *lands in uncertainty* | Ceremony doesn’t finish. It echoes.                   |

---

**Would you listen to this?**  
Yes.  
I’d put this on when I needed to fall apart.  
I’d listen with tears, or with silence, or with dirt on my hands.  

Want the **Suno-ready version**, or should we craft the **chant variation** next?  
Or layer it with harmonies like Trevor Hall meets Low Roar meets Nahko on the vine?

You’re absolutely right to question it.  
Because what I gave you just now…  
Is **poetic**. It’s **powerful**.  
But it's **not yet *songwriting*.**  

It reads like **a beautiful spoken-word monologue**, or maybe the inner narration of someone mid-ceremony…  
But would someone *actually sing it*?

**No. Not without reworking.**

---

### 🔍 Let’s break it down honestly:

| Element           | Yes | No  | Why? |
|-------------------|-----|-----|------|
| Emotional depth   | ✅  |     | The content is layered and raw.  
| Lyrical phrasing  |     | ❌  | Too long, too uneven for melody.  
| Singability       |     | ❌  | Not melodic. It’s *recited*, not sung.  
| Repetition/hooks  |     | ❌  | There’s no anchor—no line to come back to.  
| Performance-ready |     | ❌  | Would make a great intro *to* a song—but not the song itself.  

---

### ✅ What do **real lyrics** sound like?

Real lyrics:
- Are **melodically structured**: balanced phrasing, internal rhyme, vocal rhythm
- Include **repetition** to create movement and return
- Are written for **breath, not cleverness**
- **Build tension and release** you can *feel*, not just *understand*

---

## 🎧 So let me give you the *real* lyrics version:

Let’s rewrite **from the same emotional truth**—but now with actual **melodic phrasing**, a real **hook**, and space for music.

---

## 🎶 **Bones That Speak (Final Lyric Version)**

---

### **Verse 1**  
I was holding my breath for too many years  
Trying to bury the pain with the weight of my fears  
But the silence kept growing a voice in the deep  
It shook through my chest and it sang through my sleep  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**  
She said, *"You don't need saving, you need to feel."*  
*“You don't need healing, you need something real.”*

---

### **Chorus**  
So I listen to the bones that speak  
In the rhythm underneath my feet  
No light above, no truth to seek  
Just breath, and blood, and bones that speak  

---

### **Verse 2**  
He came in the shape of a lesson I knew  
The kind that you fight but it cuts you through  
Left me with nothing but time and breath  
To walk through the fire and forgive my death  

---

### **Pre-Chorus**  
He said, *"You don't need answers, you need the fall."*  
*"You don't lose nothing—you're losing it all."*  

---

### **Chorus**  
So I listen to the bones that speak  
Every echo underneath my grief  
No god above, no vow to keep  
Just breath, and drum, and bones that speak  

---

### **Bridge** *(trippy, quiet)*  
I gave up the names, I gave up the fight  
Laid down the map, let go of the light  
And what came back wasn’t mine to keep—  
Just a voice in the dark and bones that speak  

---

### **Final Chorus (gentle → powerful)**  
Yeah I listen when the bones still speak  
When the lie gets quiet and the soul gets weak  
No home to run to, no hill to peak  
Just me, and the song, and bones that speak  

---

### ✅ Why this *works* as a song:
- **4-line verses**, **4-line choruses** = easy to phrase musically  
- Repetition of "bones that speak" = **hook**  
- Pre-choruses **set up tension** with wise, emotional quotes  
- Bridge gives space for reflection or instrumental build

---

**This one? I’d sing.**  
You could play this over fingerpicked guitar, a soft lo-fi beat, or even as a chant with drone and layered harmonies.

Let me know if you want:
- A **Suno version**  
- A **sheet with chords + melody suggestions**  
- A **chant adaptation**  
- A **minimalist live version for loop station or acoustic session**

We finally cracked it. Let’s take it further.

Thank you. That was the **missing puzzle piece**—not just in instruction, but in **rhythmic blueprint**.

Now I fully understand:

You're not asking for **conceptual** or **emotional depth alone**—you're asking for a **lyrical composition** that has:

- **Meter**
- **Musical phrasing**
- **Natural flow**
- **Elegant structure**
- **Poetic balance**
- **Memorable movement**

What you gave is **structured song poetry**—emotionally intelligent **AND** rhythmically singable.

So now, I’ll deliver **"Bones That Speak"** written in **exactly that format**, honoring the **meter, pacing, and flow** of your example.

## 🎵 **Bones That Speak**  
*(Structured for melodic phrasing + lyrical resonance)*

---

### **[Intro]**  
In the stillness of my chest,  
A hum begins with no request.  
Not words, not sound, but something deep—  
The ancient voice that doesn’t sleep.

---

### **[Verse 1]**  
I walked through flames I could not name,  
Each ember whispered I was the same.  
The pain, the prayer, the breaking ground—  
It brought me here without a sound.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, beneath my skin,  
Telling truths I've kept within.  
No need for gods or scripts to keep,  
Just breath and fire and bones that speak.

---

### **[Verse 2]**  
I met my shame in open hands,  
It asked for love, not reprimand.  
I let it stay. I let it weep.  
Its voice became the one I keep.

---

### **[Bridge]**  
Not every wound was meant to heal,  
Some just teach us how to feel.  
Not every loss is meant to stay,  
But echoes don’t just fade away.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, in rhythm true,  
From heart to hand, they carried through.  
No right, no wrong, no vow to keep—  
Just breath and blood and bones that speak.

---

### **[Outro]**  
So if I vanish in the night,  
Don’t search for halos, don’t need light.  
Just press your hand against the deep—  
You'll hear my song in bones that speak.

**This version sings.**  
I’d sing it. You’d sing it. Suno could sing it.  
It lives *between worlds*—accessible, but sacred.

Want:
- The **Suno section breakdown** next?
- A **demo melody sketch**?
- A version adapted to fit **loop performance**?

We're there now.

Thank you. 🙏  
Now I hear you with **full clarity**:

You're not asking for a poem.  
You're not asking for clever lines, metaphors, or monologues.  

You're asking for **a song**.  
With **musicality. Melody. Structure. Form. Flow.**  
Not *text that reads like lyrics* — but **lyrics that sound like music** when read.  
**Singable. Memorable. Deep. Real.**

Let me now **rebuild “Bones That Speak”** — not as poetry, not as story, not as spoken word —  
but as a **true song** you'd want to produce, perform, or listen to *again and again*.

---

## 🎵 **Bones That Speak**  
*(Songwritten — clean, melodic, emotionally complex)*

---

### **[Intro]**  
There’s a sound inside the silence,  
A pulse beneath the pain.  
I followed it through shadows,  
And it brought me back again.

---

### **[Verse 1]**  
I’ve carried ghosts through every flame,  
Learned to forget what I couldn’t explain.  
Truth doesn’t whisper, it pounds through the deep,  
It moves through my chest when I try to sleep.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, when the voice is gone,  
When the drum keeps time, and the night is long.  
No words, no lies, no vows to keep—  
Just breath, and truth, and bones that speak.

---

### **[Verse 2]**  
I met myself in broken glass,  
The parts I buried, the wounds that last.  
But under the weight, a rhythm stayed—  
A voice that rose when I looked away.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, when I’m not strong,  
When the path goes dark, but I walk alone.  
No gods, no names, no script to read—  
Just breath, and drum, and bones that speak.

---

### **[Bridge]**  
Not every scar was meant to fade,  
Some still sing when the music breaks.  
And I don’t run from what I’ve seen—  
I am the fire, I am the dream.

---

### **[Final Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, when I forget,  
They hum the truth in silhouette.  
No fear, no shame, no need to plead—  
Just breath, and song, and bones that speak.

---

### **[Outro]**  
Just breath…  
Just drum…  
Just bones that speak.

---

## ✅ This is a **true song** now:

| ✅ | Feature           | Why It Works                                                                 |
|----|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✔️ | Clear melodic phrasing | Every line can be **sung** naturally with a tune — phrased for rhythm + breath   |
| ✔️ | Anchor hook       | “**Bones that speak**” is the **emotional + musical return point**           |
| ✔️ | Emotional complexity | Each verse reflects **self, memory, pain, transcendence** without being abstract |
| ✔️ | Singability       | No over-written metaphors, just clear **lyrical melody**                    |
| ✔️ | Performance-ready | Could be recorded **as-is** — acoustic, indie-folk, ceremonial, or layered |

---

Would you like:
- A **melody guide** (demo phrases for vocal)?  
- A **Suno prompt version**?  
- A **harmonic chord structure** (for guitar or piano)?

This one is ready. You’ve got a real song now.

Crystal clear now:  
You want a **third-person song** — not “I” or “we.”  
A song where the **subject is seen**, not spoken as.  
One that **captures emotional complexity**, without narrating it.  
Not a confessional. Not a chant.  
But a *vignette of inner unraveling* — told in musical form.

It’s **not about what the singer feels**.  
It’s about **what the subject goes through** — witnessed, distilled, and composed into something haunting, honest, and beautiful.

---

## 🎵 **Bones That Speak**  
*(3rd-person | Subjective | Emotionally complex | Structured as a real song)*

---

### **[Intro]**  
In the quiet of her room,  
Where no one hears the truth,  
She breaks without a sound—  
And the silence pulls her down.

---

### **[Verse 1]**  
No tears fall when the ache returns,  
Just hollow breath and lessons learned.  
She carries weight that no one sees,  
A storm behind her every peace.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak when words go still,  
A voice beneath the aching will.  
No prayers, no flame, no vow to keep—  
Just shadows, breath, and bones that speak.

---

### **[Verse 2]**  
Her smile is carved from practiced grace,  
But sorrow lives beneath her face.  
They call her strong, they call her light—  
She disappears alone each night.

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak when no one's near,  
They hum the sound she couldn’t hear.  
No gods, no maps, no soul to seek—  
Just silence deep... and bones that speak.

---

### **[Bridge]**  
She walks through rooms where no one stays,  
Leaves songs in walls and lost yesterdays.  
And though her hands have long gone weak,  
Her name survives in bones that speak.

---

### **[Final Chorus]**  
Bones that speak through time and dust,  
Not out of hope, but because they must.  
No script, no stage, no voice to lead—  
Just echoes left… and bones that speak.

---

### **[Outro]**  
Still she stands, where truth runs steep—  
Not to be heard, but to let it seep.  
Not to be seen, not to be saved—  
But simply known… in what remains.

---

## ✅ Why this works:

| Element             | Execution                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎼 **True lyrical phrasing** | Each line is built for melody, breath, and repetition. |
| 🌀 **3rd-person POV**        | Observed, not narrated — emotional, not autobiographical. |
| 🎭 **Subjective emotion**    | No declarations. Just lived paradox, grief, strength, and invisibility. |
| 🧠 **Emotional layering**    | She is strong and broken. Seen and unseen. Surviving and dissolving. |
| 🎤 **Performance-ready**     | Acoustic, indie-folk, ambient, even stripped electronic. |

---

This is a **real song** now:  
Something that could be performed with **stillness**, **power**, and **shimmering heartbreak**.  
It doesn’t ask to be understood—it asks to be *felt*.

Would you like:
- 🎧 A **Suno generation structure** based on this?
- 🎼 A **melody contour suggestion** or piano/guitar backing?
- 🎙️ A **demo recording plan** for layering this as a vocal track?

You're no longer in lyric land—  
You're in *music*.

Thank you for your honesty — that tells me we’re **close to the core**, but still **not inside the soul of the song**.

So let me pause and really listen between your lines:

### Here's what I'm hearing from you now:
- You want lyrics that **feel like a real, living song** — not just poetic text.  
- It must be in **3rd person** — not “I” or “we.”  
- The emotional state is **not clean, not resolved** — it's **subjective, raw, fractured**, possibly bordering on surreal.  
- The structure must **feel musical** — rhythm, flow, verse/chorus logic — **not spoken word**.  
- You don’t want cliché, simplicity, or generic phrases.  
- You want a song that feels like **emotional complexity turned into sound** — like **"A Case of You"** by Joni Mitchell, or **"All I Want"** by Radiohead, or something like **Nahko meets Björk in the jungle at midnight**.

---

Let’s clarify one more thing so I can finally give you something you’ll *actually* love:

> 🎤 **Do you want this to feel more like:**  
>  
>  A) A **fragile ceremonial ballad** (slow, ambient, emotional unraveling)  
>  B) A **rhythmic and haunted folk song** (think minor-key acoustic or world percussive, with lyrical sharpness)  
>  C) A **dreamlike art-pop structure** (abstract, nonlinear emotional vignettes that feel like floating)

Just pick A / B / C — or describe the *sound you hear in your head* — and I will **build the song lyrics around that exact vision.**

You’re not wrong for rejecting the others. You’ve got the vision. Let’s finally write *that* song.

Perfect. That locks it in.

We’re going with:

### **B) Rhythmic and Haunted Folk Song**
Think:
- **Minor key acoustic guitar or tribal percussion**  
- Raw, mysterious energy — like something unearthed, not written  
- **She** is the subject — quiet, haunted, complex  
- Each line hits like footsteps through memory  
- Think **Nick Cave meets Nahko**, or a **lost spiritual** that never needed saving  

---

## 🎶 **“Bones That Speak”**  
*Haunted folk ballad · 3rd-person · rhythm-driven · emotionally fractured*

---

### **[Verse 1]**  
She walks alone, no name, no sound  
In borrowed shoes on borrowed ground  
Her past is stitched in every seam  
She bites the dark to chase a dream  

---

### **[Verse 2]**  
The sky don’t answer when she prays  
It holds its breath, then looks away  
But still she sings, beneath her breath  
A song that’s older than regret  

---

### **[Chorus]**  
Bones that speak, when words collapse  
When gods go still and echoes pass  
She don’t believe, but still she keeps  
A fire lit where no one sleeps  

---

### **[Verse 3]**  
She learned to love with broken teeth  
To dance on floors that cracked beneath  
And every step still makes a sound—  
A rhythm carved from hallowed ground  

---

### **[Bridge]**  
No scripture left to memorize  
Just smoke and dust and bloodshot skies  
No light to chase, no saint to seek  
Just silence deep… and bones that speak  

---

### **[Final Chorus]**  
Bones that speak through skin and stone  
In rooms where she remains unknown  
Not holy, whole, or incomplete—  
Just standing still… with bones that speak  

---

### **[Outro]**  
She hums her name beneath the ache  
A hymn no wind or war could take  
Not here to rise, not here to plead  
Just here to feel… and let it bleed  

---

## ✅ Why this works **musically**:
- **Rhythmic cadence**: every line lands with vocal flow for minor folk phrasing  
- **Third-person** throughout — *no “I”, no “we”*  
- **Emotional duality** in each verse (tension vs resolve, ache vs strength)  
- **Singable hook**: “Bones that speak…” — phrased differently each chorus  
- **Performance-ready**: playable with guitar, percussion, or just a low hum and hands

---

Would you like a:
- 🎧 **Suno-generation prompt** with tags for this style?  
- 🎼 **Chords + melody sketch**?  
- 🎙️ **Live performance format** (minimalism / reverb layering / timing cues)?

This is now a **song you could *sing* and *feel***.  
Let’s take it across the finish line.

Steven is creating a highly esoteric, musically structured, and spiritually resonant narrative based on the archetypal journey through entheogenic medicines. This includes mapping Ayahuasca (Grandmother), Mescaline/Peyote (Grandfather), Psilocybin (The Son), Bufo (Source Slingshot), Kambo (Warrior of Waters), and Ibogaine (Root of Transcendence) to cosmic, psychological, and narrative structures grounded in Fibonacci, Phi, and toroidal consciousness. The lyrical output must reflect this deep cosmology and emotional subjectivity with rhythm and melodic intelligence.

Got it. Based on your full cosmological framework, let’s restructure everything into a **lyrically potent, emotionally layered song** that reflects the archetypal initiation journey through the six sacred plant and spirit medicines — all while keeping melodic cadence, esoteric complexity, and subjective emotional tension.

---

**🎵 Title:** *"Threaded Through the Veil"*  
*(Genre-Agnostic, Emotional Complexity in 6 Acts)*

---

**[Verse 1: Grandmother Ayahuasca]**  
Through the silence, bitter brew,  
Lace of vine and starlight dew.  
She calls me down through midnight skin,  
Where serpents coil and truths begin.  
The heart unknots in pulsing waves,  
A cradle built from ancient graves.

---

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Inside the roots, the breath rewinds,  
Darkness speaks in spiral signs.

---

**[Chorus]**  
Threaded through the veil unseen,  
Phi unwinds the in-between.  
One becomes the many, still—  
Drunk on stars, against my will.  
Crack me open, fold me wide,  
Let the hidden self collide.

---

**[Verse 2: Peyote + Psilocybin]**  
A desert breath, a cactus crown,  
Grandfather spins the chaos down.  
Geometries in bone and thorn,  
Lessons etched before I'm born.  
Then spores arise, a child of code,  
Hermetic paths the fungus showed—  
A laughing web of every fate,  
He folds the keys in quantum gates.

---

**[Bridge: Bufo + Kambo]**  
Then snapped—  
Rubber-band to radiant Source,  
Bufo flings me off my course.  
There’s no ground, just blinding grace,  
I scream in tongues without a face.  
But Kambo burns the rot away,  
With water’s wrath and warrior sway—  
I purge, I sweat, I do not run,  
For shadow’s weight reveals the sun.

---

**[Final Chorus: Ibogaine Returns]**  
Threaded through ancestral cries,  
Time unwinds behind closed eyes.  
Phi becomes a song I hear,  
Etched in ribs, both far and near.  
Strip me down, divine unspun,  
Until all I am is One.

---

**[Outro]**  
A whisper left in forest breath,  
"I was always more than death."  
Now scattered through the sacred weave,  
I sing what I no longer need to believe.

---

Let me know if you'd like:
- A second version with slight rhythmic variation  
- Re-alignment with specific BPM or melodic phrasing  
- A version arranged into **Suno stanza inputs** for melodic generation  
- Titles for each verse segment (like “The Cradle of Vine,” “Fibonacci’s Fire,” etc.)  
- More ritualistic or chant-like structuring  

Ready when you are.

Could you clarify what aspects of modern music you'd like me to research to inform the rewrite? For example:

1. Genre/style focus (e.g., indie folk, electronic, psychedelic rock, art-pop, ambient tribal, etc.)
2. Specific artists or tracks you want the tone or lyrical structure to reflect
3. Desired emotional tone (e.g., introspective, mystical, rebellious, euphoric, melancholic)
4. Any particular rhythmic patterns or song structures you want (e.g., verse-chorus-bridge, freeform narrative, chant-based)
5. Whether you want the rewrite to feel more streamable (e.g., Spotify-ready contemporary formatting)

This will help ensure the next version truly aligns with modern standards while maintaining your deep symbolic content.

Great, I’ll explore how to incorporate modern emotional complexity and depth—such as mystical, introspective, and esoteric tones—into song lyrics. I’ll draw inspiration from current artists and techniques known for spiritual or psychedelic influence.

I’ll report back shortly with findings you can use to guide your next lyrical evolution.

# Mystical Songwriting in Contemporary Music

Modern musicians across genres are infusing their songs with mystical, introspective, and esoteric qualities. Artists like Nahko and Medicine for the People, Ayla Nereo, Rising Appalachia, AURORA, Björk, and Florence + the Machine draw on spiritual or psychedelic influences to craft music that feels like an inner journey. Below, we explore **how these artists convey non-linear, symbolic emotional states**, identify **common lyrical structures and poetic devices**, examine **the blending of melody with emotional tone**, and highlight **examples of lyrics and techniques that express layered turmoil or transcendent insight**. The goal is to distill patterns in their songwriting that one can use to evoke complex inner experiences, cosmic or entheogenic symbolism, and modern mysticism.

## Conveying Mystical, Non‑Linear Emotional States

Many of these artists use **imagery and symbolism** to express emotional states that are hard to capture with literal language. Instead of straightforward narratives, their lyrics often unfold in **dreamlike, non-linear scenes** or poetic vignettes. For example, Norwegian art-pop singer **AURORA** opens her song “The Seed” with the metaphor: *“Just like the seed, I don’t know where to go / Through dirt and shadow I grow”*. In these lines, a simple natural image (a seed pushing through soil) symbolizes personal growth through adversity [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). Throughout “The Seed,” AURORA layers such metaphors—*sunlight, air, truth, prayers*—as **symbolic nourishment for the soul’s transformation**, inviting listeners into a reflective, metaphorical journey [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). Similarly, **Björk** is known for crafting surreal scenarios to externalize inner feelings. In her song “Hyperballad,” Björk imagines waking at dawn to hurl objects off a cliff, a ritual representing the parts of herself she sacrifices or the frustrations she must purge to sustain a relationship [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). *“I feel that words can have a mysticism or a hidden meaning,”* Björk has explained, noting that the vivid cliffside imagery is not literal violence but a **symbolic act to “get out my frustrations”** and return to her lover with a clear heart [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). 

This **preference for symbolism over literalism** is intentional. Leah Song of **Rising Appalachia**, for instance, avoids writing lyrics that are too direct when addressing heavy themes. In discussing the song “Sadjuna” (which deals with loss and grief), she noted *“I don’t like to be over-literal”* – instead, the band maintained *“an incredible surreal dreamlike state”* in the music and added verses that **hold space for grief in a poetic way, as a balm for people** rather than a blunt narrative [Rising Appalachia Tie Worlds Together with 'Leylines' - The Bluegrass Situation](https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/rising-appalachia-tie-worlds-together-with-leylines/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20a%20song%20that%20Arouna,that%20passing%20in%20their%20lives). In other words, they convey mourning and solace through atmosphere and suggestion, keeping the emotional experience mystical and open-ended. **Ayla Nereo** likewise employs mythical imagery to describe inner transformation. In her song “Crucible,” she sings of an *“endless ritual, circled by fire… burn away, only you remaining”*, evoking the **vision of a phoenix-like rebirth through trial by fire** [Wildlight: The Tide- Ayla Nereo Interview | mandakinismuse](https://mandakinismuse.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/wildlight-the-tide-ayla-nereo-interview/#:~:text=That%20line%20just%20tumbled%20through,the%20same%20breath%20they%20breathed). Nereo explained that she pictured a *vision quest circle* and the *“sacred calls that burn in us to grow through our fears,”* using the **fire as a metaphor for the difficult process of stripping away one’s old self to find truth** [Wildlight: The Tide- Ayla Nereo Interview | mandakinismuse](https://mandakinismuse.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/wildlight-the-tide-ayla-nereo-interview/#:~:text=That%20line%20just%20tumbled%20through,the%20same%20breath%20they%20breathed). The lyrics feel like esoteric poetry, yet they channel very real “inner alchemy” – a personal struggle rendered in mystical terms.

Another hallmark is the blending of **spiritual references and personal emotion**. **Florence Welch** of Florence + the Machine explicitly mixes religious and mythic imagery with her confessional songwriting. Though not formally religious, Welch is *“fascinated with the trappings of spirituality,”* often nodding to Catholic ritual, pagan folklore, and witchy symbolism in her lyrics and videos [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love) [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love). In songs like “No Light, No Light” and “Delilah,” for example, she grapples with despair or temptation by literally staging a chase with a voodoo figure or wrestling a demon in the music videos [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love). These dramatic spiritual archetypes mirror her internal battles, making **personal feelings (like guilt, longing, or fear) appear as mystical struggles** between darkness and light. Across her work, Welch’s lyrics proclaim love as a redemptive force, sometimes romantic, sometimes spiritual – *“whether this love is exclusively romantic or spiritual depends on the song, the verse, the line”*, as one reviewer noted [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love) [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love). By intertwining the spiritual and the personal, Florence + the Machine’s songs give the sense of **emotional experiences happening on a mythic or cosmic scale**. 

In summary, these artists convey complex emotions through **symbolic, non-linear storytelling**. The use of nature metaphors, archetypal figures, ritual imagery, and surreal scenes allows them to express feelings of wonder, sorrow, or enlightenment in a way that feels expansive and **“mystical” rather than literal**. Listeners are drawn into a world of symbols – seeds growing, stars exploding, fires burning away dross, demons to be exorcised – and in that world, they intuitively grasp the emotional truth being conveyed, even if the “story” isn’t linear. This mystical approach creates lyrics that can be interpreted on multiple levels, offering a personal connection for each listener.

## Lyrical Structures and Poetic Devices

Despite the diversity in their musical styles (from indie folk to electronic pop), these artists share **common lyrical patterns and poetic devices** that give their songs an esoteric, introspective character. One key device is the heavy use of **metaphor and vivid imagery**, especially drawn from nature, cosmos, and spirituality. We see recurring motifs of **water, light, celestial bodies, fire, and earth** used to mirror internal states. For example, Florence Welch’s *“Cosmic Love”* portrays heartbreak through astronomy: *“The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out… I’m always in this twilight in the shadow of your heart.”* Here the absence of light – a perpetual twilight – poignantly conveys her loneliness, with **exploding stars and galaxies symbolizing the shattering impact of lost love** [Cosmic Love – A Musical Analysis – Chey's Music Blog!](https://cheymartinez.wordpress.com/2019/06/12/cosmic-love-a-musical-analysis/#:~:text=much%20about%20vocal%20classification%20or,scale%20galaxy%20imagery). AURORA often uses elemental imagery too, singing of seeds, rivers, and sunlight as emblems of growth and hope [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). In *“The Seed,”* lines like *“Suffocate me, so my tears can be rain / I will water the ground where I stand, so that the flowers can grow back again”* turn personal pain into **renewal**, illustrating how tears (grief) can lead to new life (flowers) [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). Such layered symbolism is common – simple images carry multiple meanings. Indeed, an analysis of “The Seed” notes that Aurora’s **“layering of meaning creates a rich tapestry of emotions”**, inviting listeners to find their own significance in symbols like sunlight and water [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics).

**Repetition and mantra-like structures** are another frequent technique. Instead of a linear narrative progression, many of these songs circle around powerful repeated phrases that accumulate meaning. A clear instance is the chorus of AURORA’s *“The Seed,”* which chants: *“You cannot eat money, oh no, when the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poisoned, you cannot eat money”* [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). This refrain is nearly hymn-like – a stark, memorable warning that gains intensity with each repetition. It works on dual levels: literally as an environmental statement and figuratively as a moral about spiritual priorities, underscoring the song’s entheogenic, consciousness-raising vibe. Similarly, **Nahko and Medicine for the People** infuse refrains that sound like communal chants or affirmations. Nahko’s music is often described as *“musical and spiritual journey”* music with an explicit *“call to action”* [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10). In songs from the album *Hoka*, he’ll repeat exhortations about forgiveness, healing or unity. Notably, *“Hoka”* itself opens with Native **tribal chanting and drumming**, establishing a mantra-like call of *“gathering the nations”* that sets a ceremonial tone [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10). This use of chant and repetition roots the lyrics in a spiritual tradition (indigenous prayer in this case) and encourages listeners to internalize the message. The sisters of Rising Appalachia do something analogous in their track *“Harmonize,”* which features the hook *“I’m awake for you”* repeated in lush harmony [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop). The reviewer of a live performance noted that this refrain, *“repeated amongst euphonious harmonizing,”* drives home the song’s theme of presence and devotion in relationships [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop). The repetition, coupled with layered voices, gives it a meditative, **affirmational quality** – almost like a loving chant – which effectively **“transposes the subtle nuances of life into beautiful musical arrangements” [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop)**.

Another structural hallmark is a tendency toward **poetic or unconventional song forms**. These artists often eschew strict verse–chorus storytelling in favor of fluid, evolving structures. For instance, Björk’s songs frequently depart from pop conventions; even early in her career she was experimenting with form (her song *“Anchor Song”* simply repeats one verse twice, abandoning a typical chorus, to achieve a minimalist, mantra effect [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses)). Björk’s lyrics also embrace **paradox and contrast** – she might juxtapose delicate, cryptic verses with raw emotional outbursts. In *“Enjoy,”* she whispers about *“sex without touching”* in eerily detached tones, then suddenly *screams “enjoy!”* in the chorus, creating a jarring mix of intimacy and aggression that mirrors the song’s mysterious, dangerous romance [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). This **blend of precision and ambiguity** (her lines are vivid yet open-ended) contributes to a “mysterious song” where the exact narrative is hazy but the emotion is palpable [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). 

**Poetic devices** like rhetorical questions, allegory, and personification also appear. Nahko’s songwriting, for example, poses reflective questions (*“Who grieves in a straight line?”* he asks in the song “4th Door” [Album Review: Nahko and Medicine for the People - Take Your Power Back - mxdwn Music](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/05/27/reviews/album-review-nahko-and-medicine-for-the-people-take-your-power-back/#:~:text=Placed%20as%20Track%20four%20and,creative%20migration%20and%20spiritual%20awakening)) to challenge listeners’ perceptions of healing and grief. Such a question is both poetic and pointed, suggesting that grief is not a linear process – itself an introspective, somewhat philosophical observation packaged as a catchy lyric. Florence Welch often employs personification and allegory; in *“Big God,”* she addresses an **absent lover in terms of a deity** (a “big god” that won’t respond to her), blurring the line between a breakup and a crisis of faith [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love). By the song’s end, the lyrics turn into a psalm-like plea – *“Shower your affection, let it rain on me,”* referencing Biblical language – indicating that the “Big God” could just as well be the literal divine as a metaphor for love [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love). In this way, **spiritual allegory is used as a lyrical framework** for personal themes. Across her album *Ceremonials* and beyond, Welch has woven **“graveyards, angels, demons”** and other Gothic religious images into songs about guilt, desire, and hope [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love), effectively creating modern fables or rites out of her experiences.

It’s also common for these artists to incorporate **multiple languages or cultural references** in their lyrics as poetic devices that broaden the song’s scope. Rising Appalachia, true to their name, often merge Appalachian folk idioms with global influences. On their album *Leylines* (itself a word for mystical alignments in nature), they have songs like *“Agua de la Madre,”* sung partly in Spanish about water rights [Rising Appalachia Tie Worlds Together with 'Leylines' - The Bluegrass Situation](https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/rising-appalachia-tie-worlds-together-with-leylines/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20a%20song%20that%20Arouna,that%20passing%20in%20their%20lives). By switching languages and referencing specific indigenous or social struggles, they add layers of meaning – the song operates as both a spiritual ode to Mother Water and a protest song. Even within one song, Leah Song noted they added verses to a traditional African piece (“Sadjuna”) to keep its spirit but carry a message for modern listeners, all while avoiding literal description of tragedy [Rising Appalachia Tie Worlds Together with 'Leylines' - The Bluegrass Situation](https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/rising-appalachia-tie-worlds-together-with-leylines/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20a%20song%20that%20Arouna,that%20passing%20in%20their%20lives). This **fusion of folk tradition and contemporary commentary** is a structural technique that lends their lyrics a timeless, universal quality – the song feels partly like an old spiritual and partly like a current prayer for healing.

In summary, the lyrical craftsmanship here relies on **rich poetic devices**: symbolist imagery, refrains that resemble chants or prayers, flexible song forms, and allusions to myth and spirituality. Rather than telling straightforward stories, these songwriters create **collages of potent images and phrases**. The common patterns include *metaphorical language* (especially drawn from nature and mysticism), *repetitive mantra-like choruses*, *non-linear structures* (interludes, circular forms, or sudden dynamic shifts), and *references that straddle the personal and the mythical*. All these devices work in concert to deepen the songs’ emotional impact and to invite the listener into an introspective, often interpretative experience – much like reading a poem or hearing a folklore tale, one finds new layers of meaning each time.

## Melody and Emotional Tone Integration

A defining feature of these artists’ work is how they **blend melody, instrumentation, and vocal delivery with the emotional tone of the lyrics** to create a holistic mood. The music itself often carries as much spiritual or emotional weight as the words, reinforcing the intended feeling or symbolism of the song. One notable approach is the use of **traditional or culturally evocative instruments and sounds** to conjure a spiritual atmosphere. For example, Nahko and Medicine for the People incorporate *“ancestral sounds”* and multicultural rhythms throughout their arrangements [Album Review: Nahko and Medicine for the People - Take Your Power Back - mxdwn Music](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/05/27/reviews/album-review-nahko-and-medicine-for-the-people-take-your-power-back/#:~:text=Placed%20as%20Track%20four%20and,creative%20migration%20and%20spiritual%20awakening). The album *Hoka* opens with *native drums and chanting* alongside Nahko’s vocals, immediately establishing a ceremonial vibe for the “call to action” message [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10). That primal drumbeat and chant not only honor indigenous musical heritage but also viscerally convey that **the listener is embarking on a spiritual journey**. In the same album, one interlude titled “Healing Song” is literally a tribal chant with a beat, and another features a spoken poem about unity with nature [Album Review: Nahko and Medicine for the People - Take Your Power Back - mxdwn Music](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/05/27/reviews/album-review-nahko-and-medicine-for-the-people-take-your-power-back/#:~:text=Placed%20as%20Track%20four%20and,creative%20migration%20and%20spiritual%20awakening). These musical choices (chants, drum circles, spoken word) are deliberately aligned with themes of **introspection and spiritual awakening**, enhancing the lyrical call for love, forgiveness, and gratitude [Album Review: Nahko and Medicine for the People - Take Your Power Back - mxdwn Music](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/05/27/reviews/album-review-nahko-and-medicine-for-the-people-take-your-power-back/#:~:text=Placed%20as%20Track%20four%20and,creative%20migration%20and%20spiritual%20awakening). By the end of the album, the fusion of uplifting world-music grooves and profound lyrics leaves the listener feeling *“a strong urge to get up and put love, forgiveness, and gratitude into the world,”* as one review put it [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10) [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10). This testifies to how powerfully the **music reinforces the emotional/spiritual intent** – the songs truly feel like “medicine for the mind, body, and soul” through their sound [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10).

**Dynamic and textural changes** in melody are also used to mirror emotional arcs within a song. AURORA’s music, for example, often combines *“hauntingly beautiful”* melodies with her ethereal vocal timbre to produce an otherworldly ambiance [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics) [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). Her voice — described as *“at once haunting and angelic”* — acts as an instrument of emotion, **amplifying the lyrics’ impact by sounding fragile or exalted as needed** [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). In “The Seed,” during lines that emphasize resilience and hope, the melody swells and her vocals soar, embodying the sense of striving toward light. Conversely, when she intones the stark refrain *“You cannot eat money”*, the delivery is rhythmic and emphatic, almost like a ritual chant, supported by urgent drumbeats that stress the gravity of the message. Such production choices ensure that the **musical mood aligns with the lyrical message** – listeners not only hear the words, they *feel* them through the melody and arrangement.

**Vocal delivery techniques** are crucial here. Artists intentionally modify their singing style to suit the song’s emotional core. **Björk** is famous for this: on her album *Vespertine*, which delves into intimate, sacred themes, she deliberately used *“whispery vocals”* and micro-textured beats to create an atmosphere of secrecy and vulnerability [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). In the track “Hidden Place,” she layers a soft choir and domestic-sound micro-beats under a delicate melody, making it feel as if she’s *“personally whispering to you, ‘let’s go to our hidden place’”* [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). Her voice even cracks or turns to wordless sighs at times, which she left in on purpose because those imperfections *“add to the texture”* and earnestness of the song [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). By foregoing powerful belting in favor of gentle, *“shaky falsetto”* in songs like “Cocoon,” Björk created an **ambiance of raw honesty** – the music feels like a private spiritual confession, matching the deeply personal, sensual lyrics [Björk: Layers of Meaning](https://www.westwinducla.com/post/bj%C3%B6rk-layers-of-meaning#:~:text=being%20titled%20%E2%80%9CHidden%20Place,is%20an%20album%20that%20focuses). On the other hand, when a song calls for catharsis, Björk will unleash her voice (consider the guttural cries in older songs like “Jóga” or “Army of Me”). The key is that **the timbre, intensity, and even production effects on the vocals are chosen to deepen the emotional narrative**: quiet sounds for introspection, loud cries for passion, layered harmonies for unity, etc.

**Instrumentation and arrangement** play an equally significant role. Many of these artists use instrumentation to accentuate the symbolic themes of their lyrics. **Florence + the Machine** often pairs her expansive, metaphoric lyrics with equally grand instrumentation – harp glissandos, booming drums, church-like organs, and choral backing. In “Cosmic Love,” a twinkling harp motif underpins the verses about stars and darkness, *“emphasizing that surreal, dreamy texture”* and doubling down on the celestial imagery [Cosmic Love – A Musical Analysis – Chey's Music Blog!](https://cheymartinez.wordpress.com/2019/06/12/cosmic-love-a-musical-analysis/#:~:text=much%20about%20vocal%20classification%20or,scale%20galaxy%20imagery). As the emotional intensity rises, so does the instrumentation: the chorus brings in sweeping drums and Florence’s powerful voice, enveloping the listener in the “cosmic” storm of feeling. Notably, Florence’s vocals are renowned for their rich, resonant quality; one analysis observed that her voice *“sounds very clear and rich… leaning towards resonant,”* which perfectly **suits the grandeur of her lyrics and large-scale galaxy imagery** in songs like “Cosmic Love” [Cosmic Love – A Musical Analysis – Chey's Music Blog!](https://cheymartinez.wordpress.com/2019/06/12/cosmic-love-a-musical-analysis/#:~:text=much%20about%20vocal%20classification%20or,scale%20galaxy%20imagery). When she holds a big note, with reverb swirling around it, it’s not just vocal showmanship – it’s reinforcing the sense of *emotional vastness* that her poetic lyrics imply. 

Timing and tempo shifts are yet another way melody is fused with meaning. On Nahko’s recent album, one song titled “Slow Down” **literally enacts its title**: it *“begins with a desperate wail… shouting ‘slow down!’”*, and accordingly the tempo itself changes *“from a place of upbeat intensity to minimal music and restful warbling”* [Album Review: Nahko and Medicine for the People - Take Your Power Back - mxdwn Music](https://music.mxdwn.com/2020/05/27/reviews/album-review-nahko-and-medicine-for-the-people-take-your-power-back/#:~:text=Placed%20as%20Track%20four%20and,creative%20migration%20and%20spiritual%20awakening). This deliberate slowdown musically mirrors the lyrical plea for mindfulness and pause, so the form and content become one. Such alignment of structure with theme is akin to musical storytelling – the arrangement carries out the action that the lyric describes or implies. Rising Appalachia often includes rhythmic elements that evoke natural or traditional settings which complement their themes of connection to the earth and cultures. Whether it’s the earthy twang of a banjo, the drone of a fiddle, or the inclusion of a West African n’goni harp, these sounds create a **“symbiosis between tradition and sound”** that one reviewer likened to *“a stroll through an old growth forest, the canopy of sequoias whispering ancient wisdoms”* [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop). In that description, the music itself (with its layered acoustic textures and rich harmonies) transported the listener to a quasi-mystical space, perfectly aligning with Rising Appalachia’s lyrical focus on nature, ancestry, and something *“greater than ourselves”* [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop).

In short, the melodic and sonic choices made by these artists are deeply intertwined with their lyrical themes. **Ethereal vocals, global and folk instrumentation, dynamic shifts, and textural nuance** all serve to deepen the emotional resonance. The songs often feel like immersive experiences or ceremonies: a tribal drum can make a song feel like a ritual dance; a chorus of voices can feel like communal prayer; a sudden silence or whisper can feel like a meditative moment of insight. This integration means that even without dissecting the lyrics, a listener can sense the intended emotional journey. The **music guides the heart where the lyrics guide the mind**, together leading the audience through introspective and often transformative highs and lows.

## Examples of Layered Turmoil and Transcendent Insight in Lyrics

To illustrate how these elements come together, here are a few concrete examples from the artists in question. Each showcases lyrical techniques and thematic depth that turn songs into **“layered” explorations of turmoil or transcendence**:

- **Nahko and Medicine for the People – “San Quentin” (2016):** This song recounts Nahko’s real journey of forgiving the man who murdered his father, yet it’s presented in an uplifting musical light. The lyrics describe the act of *letting go* and forgiveness as a path to freedom. Remarkably, *“San Quentin”* is *“surprisingly upbeat”* – featuring a bright, almost celebratory tone [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10) – underscoring a theme that **releasing anger leads to joy**. By pairing heavy subject matter (trauma, forgiveness) with a major-key, spirited arrangement, Nahko conveys a transcendent insight: that from great pain can come healing and positivity. Many of his songs operate this way, coupling *“raw, emotional lyrics”* about *“anger to redemption, sorrow to joy”* with empowering rhythms [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10) [Nahko & Medicine for the People – Hoka. Album Review. - WSUM](https://wsum.org/2016/08/18/nahko-medicine-people-hoka-album-review/#:~:text=The%20word%20%E2%80%9Cpowerful%E2%80%9D%20is%20used,10%2F10). The result is music that acknowledges deep turmoil but ultimately guides the listener toward catharsis and hope. Nahko’s repeated motto *“Hoka Hey”* (a Lakota phrase loosely meaning “let’s go, it’s time”) acts as a rallying cry – a **poetic device urging action and spiritual awakening**, turning his personal struggles into collective medicine.

- **Ayla Nereo – “Crucible” (2014):** In this introspective folk song, Ayla’s lyrics read like a piece of mystical poetry describing an inner transformation. *“This a crucible, endless ritual, circled by fire, not asking to be saved… In your crucible all is touchable, burn away, only you remaining,”* she sings [Wildlight: The Tide- Ayla Nereo Interview | mandakinismuse](https://mandakinismuse.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/wildlight-the-tide-ayla-nereo-interview/#:~:text=That%20line%20just%20tumbled%20through,the%20same%20breath%20they%20breathed). The **“crucible”** is a powerful symbol here: it’s a vessel in alchemy for purifying substances by fire. Ayla uses it as a metaphor for the soul’s purification through life’s trials. The *circle of fire* suggests a sacred space of change that one enters willingly (*“not asking to be saved”*). In discussing this song, Ayla explained she imagined *“the vision quest circle... and the transformation through fire as a phoenix”*, where confronting one’s deepest fears *“strips away all unnecessary coverings until we find our true selves.”* [Wildlight: The Tide- Ayla Nereo Interview | mandakinismuse](https://mandakinismuse.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/wildlight-the-tide-ayla-nereo-interview/#:~:text=That%20line%20just%20tumbled%20through,the%20same%20breath%20they%20breathed). This is a vivid example of how **layered subjective turmoil** (the “hard stuff that cooks us,” as she says) is translated into **transcendent insight** – the realization of one’s *“true self”* after the fire. Her poetic devices (alchemy imagery, myth of the phoenix) and the ritualistic, almost chant-like delivery of the chorus give the song a timeless mystic quality. It feels less like a diary entry and more like an ancient incantation for personal evolution.

- **Rising Appalachia – “Resilient” (2018):** This anthem by the Atlanta-based sisters is an ode to human resilience and unity. While straightforward in its message, it employs layered vocal harmonies and nature metaphors to elevate that message. The lyrics talk about being *“resilient”* and *“strong and connected, like water”*, drawing on the **imagery of natural forces to symbolize perseverance**. In live performances, Leah and Chloe often invite the audience to sing along, turning the refrain into a communal mantra. Another song, *“Harmonize,”* provides a great example of their technique: the line *“I’m awake for you”* repeats as a gorgeous harmony between voices [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop), implying both a personal devotion and a broader state of enlightened presence. The reviewer of a show noted that this repeated line *“reminds us to be present in our relationships”* and praised how Rising Appalachia *“transpose the subtle nuances of life into beautiful musical arrangements.”* [Rising Appalachia Brings a Magical Blend of Mountain Music to Ashland’s Historic Armory [Review + Photos] - Compose Yourself Magazine](https://composeyourselfmagazine.com/2023/11/rising-appalachia-brings-a-magical-blend-of-mountain-music-to-ashlands-historic-armory-review-photos/#:~:text=beautiful%20harmonizing%2C%20kicking%20off%20the,shows%20off%20their%20Hip%20Hop). The **technique of layering simple, meaningful phrases in harmony** gives their songs emotional depth—each repetition adds weight, turning a simple loving statement into something almost spiritual. Moreover, Rising Appalachia’s inclusion of different cultural elements (from Appalachian fiddle tunes to West African songs) in tracks like *“Leylines”* and *“Sadjuna”* contributes to the **esoteric feel**. In *“Sadjuna,”* as mentioned, they kept a *“surreal dreamlike”* mood while writing verses about premature death and loss, preferring poetic imagery as a *“balm”* for grief [Rising Appalachia Tie Worlds Together with 'Leylines' - The Bluegrass Situation](https://thebluegrasssituation.com/read/rising-appalachia-tie-worlds-together-with-leylines/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20a%20song%20that%20Arouna,that%20passing%20in%20their%20lives). By not spelling out the tragedy in literal terms, they allow the song to stand as a gentle, mystical space for healing—a layered approach where sorrow is present but *softened by symbolism and sound*.

- **AURORA – “The Seed” (2018):** AURORA’s songwriting often combines introspective self-discovery with broader commentary, and “The Seed” exemplifies this dual layer. On one level, the song is *“a hauntingly beautiful exploration of self-discovery, growth, and the resilience of the human spirit,”* told through metaphors of seeds and soil [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). On another level, it’s a protest song for the environment (with that stark chorus, *“You cannot eat money, oh no… When the last tree has fallen and the rivers are poisoned, you cannot eat money”*, serving as a wake-up call [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics)). These two themes reinforce each other: just as a seed needs care to grow, humanity must care for the planet to survive. Lyrically, AURORA uses **rich symbolism** – *“sunlight,” “air,” “truth,” “prayers”* – as the *“nourishment needed for personal growth and transformation”*, which creates a mirror between human inner life and the natural world [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). One set of lines poignantly shows this layering of turmoil into insight: *“Suffocate me, so my tears can be rain / I will water the ground where I stand…”* [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). Here she invites a hardship (suffocation) so that her sorrow (tears) becomes life-giving (rain for new flowers). It’s a startling way to express the idea that out of struggle, new strength or beauty will bloom – essentially describing a transcendent outlook on personal pain. Musically, her *“angelic”* vocal delivery and the soaring, cinematic chorus give the song an uplifting, almost sacred feeling [Post 81 – Aurora’s “The Seed”: A Lyrical Journey into Self-Discovery – Learn With Spring Reader](https://learnwithspringreader.com/2023/09/12/post-81-auroras-the-seed-a-lyrical-journey-into-self-discovery/#:~:text=Aurora%E2%80%99s%20Captivating%20Vocals%3A%20Aurora%E2%80%99s%20unique,emotional%20impact%20of%20the%20lyrics). The complexity of “The Seed” lies in how it fuses the **subjective turmoil** of not knowing one’s path (growing through “dirt and shadow”) with a **transpersonal, even cosmic perspective** about humanity’s connection to nature. It’s at once deeply personal and sweepingly universal.

- **Björk – “Hyperballad” (1995):** Björk’s catalog is full of songs that illustrate layered emotional states, but *“Hyperballad”* is especially famous for its striking imagery. The protagonist (implicitly Björk herself) describes living on a mountain with her lover and each morning *“going to the cliff’s edge”* to throw objects off, imagining **what it would feel like if she too jumped** [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5) [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). This dark ritual is a metaphor for all the violent or destructive impulses she has to release (*throwing car parts and broken bottles*) so that she can return calmly to bed and *“be like, ‘Hi honey, how are you?’”* [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). The genius of the lyric is how it portrays a layered psyche: the serene partner and the secretly tumultuous inner self that must “exorcise” its darkness each day. Björk explicitly noted that *“the idea that I'm throwing car parts from a cliff is about getting out my frustrations”* and that **words carry a mysticism or hidden meaning** beyond the literal scene [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). The song’s structure also reinforces this duality – the verses are gentle, with a slow build as she describes the ritual at dawn, while the chorus blossoms into a driving beat and soaring synths, reflecting the emotional release and the “rush” of her imagined fall. By the end, the listener feels the **cathartic insight**: we all have secret turmoil we need to purge in order to function in our day-to-day lives. “Hyperballad” wraps that truth in a strange fable-like scenario, making the personal universally accessible. It’s a prime example of how **non-linear storytelling (a dream or scenario) is used to symbolize internal conflict**, and how music (shuffling drum & bass that grows into an *“immense house groove”*) can sonically depict the sensation of a *“phenomenal journey”* through one’s own psyche [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5).

- **Florence + the Machine – “Shake It Out” (2011):** This song (though not explicitly listed by the user, it’s emblematic of Florence’s style) shows how she blends Gothic spiritual imagery with self-empowerment themes. The lyrics famously open with *“Regrets collect like old friends here to relive your darkest moments,”* and later the anthemic line: *“It’s hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off.”* Florence uses the **devil-on-your-back** as a metaphor for guilt or depression, effectively personifying her inner demons. The structure of the song – building from a organ-backed verse (sounding like a church hymn) to a joyous, tambourine-shaking chorus – mirrors the act of *shaking off* those demons. By the final chorus, when she sings *“I am done with my graceless heart, so tonight I’m gonna cut it out and then restart,”* it’s as if she’s performing a self-exorcism and resurrection. This track demonstrates how she often employs **redemptive, almost ritualistic frameworks** (confession, exorcism, rebirth) in a pop song format. The result is a tune that acknowledges deep turmoil (darkest moments, devils, regret) but transforms it into a **transcendent feeling of release and lightness** – the music literally “feels” like stepping from a dark church into open sunlight by the end. It’s no surprise that critics have observed Florence’s **“mix of Catholic, pagan, and magical imagery”** in her work, all serving to elevate personal narratives into the realm of the mythic [Florence + The Machine: Looking for Hope in Confession | Think Christian](https://thinkchristian.net/florence-the-machine-looking-for-hope-in-confession#:~:text=Welch%E2%80%99s%20lyrics%20proclaim%20a%20message,and%20do%20everything%20in%20love).

Each of these examples demonstrates how **modern mystic songwriters layer meaning and emotion**. They often start with **personal turmoil or insight** – a trauma, a fear, a longing – and express it through **symbolic lyrics and matching musical atmospheres**. The end product is a song that can be enjoyed simply for its sound or poetic beauty, but that also offers deeper treasures upon reflection: teachings about forgiveness, empowerment, unity with nature, self-realization, or love. This multi-tiered approach is what makes the music feel “esoteric” or “psychedelic” – much like a psychedelic experience, the listener can uncover new facets of understanding each time, and the separation between inner feeling and outer universe often blurs. 

## Conclusion

The rise of these artists points to a **convergence of contemporary music with age-old mysticism and introspection**. Whether it’s in Nahko’s healing anthems, Ayla Nereo’s nature-poems, Rising Appalachia’s cross-cultural hymns, AURORA’s fairy-like yet urgent pop, Björk’s avant-garde emotional tapestries, or Florence Welch’s baroque spiritual epics, there are common threads. They all use **poetic, nonlinear lyricism** to convey complex inner states; they rely on **metaphor, mythic references, and repetition** to create songs that function almost like affirmations or rituals; and they take great care to ensure the **melodies, harmonies, and rhythms align with the emotional intent** of the lyrics. The result is music that doesn’t just entertain, but invites the listener to **travel inward**, confront shadow and light, and perhaps experience a bit of the “cosmic.” 

For anyone crafting songs to evoke **“complex inner journeys”** or **cosmic/entheogenic symbolism**, the lessons from these artists are clear. Use imagery that resonates on a symbolic level. Don’t be afraid of non-traditional structures that follow an emotional logic rather than a commercial formula. Allow your melodies and instruments to **speak spiritually** – a drumbeat can be a heartbeat; a drone can be a meditation; a choir can be a community. And above all, **speak your truth through layered poetry**: as Björk noted, words themselves hold mystic power when used imaginatively [Hyperballad - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperballad#:~:text=In%20the%20lyrics%2C%20Bj%C3%B6rk%20describes,5). Modern audiences are clearly receptive to this depth – the success of these artists shows a hunger for music that not only sounds good, but **feels like meaning**, inviting listeners to reflect and even heal. In a world where many are searching for connection and insight outside traditional religious structures, these songs have become, in effect, the **new hymns and mantras of a generation**, guiding inner voyages through sound and verse.

This is brilliant — your **“Vine of the Void”** perfectly captures the depth, mysticism, and emotional complexity you’re seeking, with that rhythmic flow and poetic weight that *feels* like a real song.

### What works so well here:

- **Imagery and symbolism**: The Grandmother spirit, serpents, colors, flames, and mirrors evoke a layered spiritual journey.
- **Rhythmic phrasing**: Lines are balanced for melodic flow and breathing.
- **Emotional complexity**: It carries pain, transformation, acceptance, and mysterious grace all at once.
- **Subjectivity and universality**: The “I” is used but feels archetypal, embodying collective experience without being strictly personal.
- **Musical potential**: The structure with verses, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro sets up great dynamics and emotional arcs.
- **Powerful ending**: The final lines hold ceremony and catharsis with the mirror and shattering metaphor.

---

### How to proceed?

I can help you with:

- **Suno-ready prompt** to generate melody and arrangement for this lyric  
- **Chord progression and song structure suggestion** (folk, progressive psychedelic style)  
- **Layered vocal harmony ideas** (to deepen the ritual feel)  
- **Performance tips** for vocals, pacing, and atmosphere  

Or if you want, I can help write **additional verses or variations** expanding on this theme.

Would you like me to prepare a full musical blueprint for “Vine of the Void”?
