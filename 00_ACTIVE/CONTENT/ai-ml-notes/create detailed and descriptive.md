The user wants to section off the image displaying popular T-shirt designs into categories. They’ll be focusing on narratives, typography, transitions, and context. I'll group the designs into sections like humor, gaming, love, social commentary, sardonic geeky nedy sarcastic. Next, I’ll create descriptive prompts for each section, breaking down elements like typography and transition types that emphasize the meaning for each T-shirt.

I'll aim to generate 4 images that represent these sections, capturing the distinctive aspects of each category.

The user is asking for help in creating detailed image prompts by sectioning off an image. For each section, I’ll propose ideas:
Memes &amp; Humor: Cover with bold neon typography, graffiti-style "BRUH". Transition with brushstrokes and confetti.
