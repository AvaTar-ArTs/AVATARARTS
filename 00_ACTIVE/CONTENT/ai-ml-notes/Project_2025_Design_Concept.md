  "prompt": "Create a bold and edgy typographic cover image with the phrase “Project 2025: Blueprint for Control” as the central text. The typography should be stylized with a geeky and digital aesthetic, featuring circuit board patterns, glitch effects, and embedded visuals of security cameras, barbed wire, and lines of digital code. Use sharp, angular fonts with a modern techno vibe. The color scheme should feature vivid electric blue and fiery orange against a deep, dark grey background to create dramatic contrast and a sense of urgency. The overall composition should feel intense and foreboding, symbolizing surveillance, power, and digital control, while intriguing the viewer with a futuristic narrative tone. Format is vertical (9:16), resolution 1080x1920."

  "prompt": "In a cozy, neon-lit alley at midnight, soaked in gentle rain, a grungy raccoon singer performs with his band. The scene blends modern American digital comic book style with rich color and detailed illustration. Sammy, a human male in his mid-30s with shaggy brown hair, wears a faded blue denim jacket, white t-shirt, and dark jeans. He stands holding an acoustic guitar. Around him are four raccoons playing folk instruments: one on banjo, another on fiddle, one with a small drum, and one on a double bass. Hanging lanterns cast warm glows, and the serene moonlit night shows a full moon in a clear sky above. The atmosphere is whimsical, moody, and inviting."
