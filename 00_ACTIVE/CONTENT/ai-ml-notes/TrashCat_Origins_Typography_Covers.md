Take me back please

In the night so silent  
Loneliness does creep  
Yet the moon she guides me  
Through the pain in which I weep

Once the soul of the alley  
Howling cat's song  
Loud and strong  
Echoing through moonlit nights  
Heartbreak  
Defiance in each note

A story told  
Crowds gathered  
Truth unfold  
Whispers through the midnight air  
Moonly alley  
Still we care

Moonly alley  
Won’t forget  
Haunted by the songs we met  
Heart and soul in every beat  
Sammy's tune  
Bittersweet

Each corner holds a ghostly dream  
Melody  
We scream  
We scream  
Broken hearts played on the strings  
Words of love  
And broken things

**Bridge:**
In the shadows  
Memories stay  
Howling cat  
That bluesy sway  
Music that we can't erase  
Moonly alley  
Sacred place

Moonly alley  
Won’t forget  
Haunted by the songs we met  
Heart and soul in every beat  
Sammy's tune  
Bittersweet
