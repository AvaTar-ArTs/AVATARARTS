The story explores the intricate balance between creation and destruction, posing fundamental questions about the nature of good and evil, instinct and intellect, power and the moral responsibility that comes with it.\n\nThe narrative unfolds in a mystical village called Elderglen, painted with vibrant life but shadowed by lurking darkness. The villagers live unaware of the delicate equilibrium upon which their existence rests. In the backdrop of this idyllic setting, the tale of two celestial beings, Catheria and Salome, gradually unfolds—each a symbolic embodiment of matter and antimatter, presence and void.\n\nCatheria, revealed as Hecate, moves through the village, drawing vitality from the unsuspecting villagers. Her allure enthralls them, yet beneath her radiant facade lies an insatiable hunger—a void within that must be filled with the essence of life force. Despite her initial portrayal as a devourer, the narrative suggests her actions stem not from malice but from an uncomprehended need.\n\nConversely, Salome embodies wisdom and cosmic order, her arrival in Elderglen acting as a catalyst for change. Her purpose becomes to guide Catheria, to teach her the ways of balance—highlighting a duality in the forces that shape the universe.\n\nThe narrative crescendos in a battle between these forces, underscoring themes of redemption and the potential for change. As darkness recedes, the villagers awaken to a newfound appreciation for the balance that sustains their world. The story closes with the legend of Catheria and Salome's enduring legacy—a whispered reminder of hope and courage in the face of darkness.\n\nThe frequent invocation of imagery—dancing shadows, veils of mist, and the cosmic dance of stars and planets—serves to create a world that's both fantastical and reflective, drawing parallels between the microcosm of Elderglen and the larger, universal struggles of balance in existence."

The analysis is quite detailed, so I need to extract key elements for the CSV—title, themes, characters, settings, and visual motifs. For the storyboard prompts, I should break down the narrative into scenes with vivid descriptions that would work well with a video generation model like Sora, focusing on visual and emotional cues.\n\nThe CSV should be straightforward, capturing the essence of the report in a structured format. For the storyboard, I'll map the narrative flow into scenes, ensuring each prompt includes setting, action, and visual style to guide the generation. The prompts should be evocative and align with the themes of balance, duality, and cosmic struggle described in the analysis.\n\nI'll keep the CSV concise and the prompts rich in imagery to match the tone of the original analysis. The user didn’t specify a particular format for the CSV, so I’ll use a simple table with headers. For the storyboard, I’ll number the scenes for clarity and include details that would help generate consistent visual style across scenes."

Sora Storyboard Prompts\n\nHere are prompts designed to generate key scenes from the script using a video generation model like Sora. Each prompt includes a scene description and a tailored prompt for generation.\n\n**Scene 1: Establishing Shot of Elderglen**\n*   **Description:** Introduce the vibrant yet mysteriously shadowed village.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `A cinematic drone shot soaring over Elderglen, a mystical village nestled in a lush, sun-dappled valley. Vibrant, magical flora pulses with soft light. Cinematic, photorealistic, 4k, mystical atmosphere, dancing shadows in the forest periphery, a veil of mist clinging to the ancient rooftops.`\n\n**Scene 2: Catheria's Alluring Presence**\n*   **Description:** Catheria moves through the village, enchanting the villagers while subtly drawing their energy.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `A mesmerizing woman with an ethereal glow (Catheria) walks through a bustling medieval fantasy village market. She is radiant and alluring, villagers are captivated, smiling as she passes. But with each interaction, a barely visible wisp of golden light flows from them to her. Slow motion, magical realism, expressive faces, a sense of subtle unease beneath the beauty.`\n\n**Scene 3: The Void Within Catheria**\n*   **Description:** A close-up revealing the insatiable hunger and void beneath Catheria's facade.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `Extreme close-up on Catheria's face. Her beautiful, radiant exterior flickers for a moment, revealing a glimpse of an infinite, dark, and starry void within her eyes. The reflection of a terrified villager is seen in her pupil. Hyper-detailed, surreal, cosmic horror subtlely woven into beauty.`\n\n**Scene 4: Salome's Arrival**\n*   **Description:** Salome arrives in Elderglen, a figure of calm and cosmic wisdom.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `A wise, serene woman (Salome) dressed in robes of starry nebulas materializes from a shaft of moonlight at the edge of Elderglen. She observes the village with ancient, knowing eyes. The air around her shimmers with geometric patterns of cosmic energy. Cinematic, high contrast, awe-inspiring.`\n\n**Scene 5: The Confrontation and Guidance**\n*   **Description:** Salome confronts Catheria, not with violence, but with intent to guide and teach.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `Salome and Catheria stand facing each other in a moonlit ancient stone circle. Salome extends her hand, not in attack, but offering. Between them, a visualization of the cosmic balance appears: galaxies swirling and void coexisting. Ethereal light, symbolic visual effects, tense but not violent.`\n\n**Scene 6: The Climactic Battle of Forces**\n*   **Description:** A non-physical battle of light and darkness, order and chaos.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `An abstract, cosmic battle in the sky above Elderglen. Tendrils of consuming darkness (Catheria) clash with intricate, mandala-like patterns of pure light (Salome). The stars and planets themselves seem to be part of the dance. No human forms, just pure energy and light. Dynamic, vast scale, inspired by Hubble telescope imagery.`\n\n**Scene 7: Darkness Recedes / The New Dawn**\n*   **Description:** The balance is restored. The villagers awaken to a new understanding.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `Sunrise over Elderglen. The oppressive shadows have lifted. The villagers emerge from their homes, looking up at the sky with a newfound wonder and appreciation. The light is warm and golden, the village looks more vibrant and real than ever before. Hopeful, peaceful, cinematic wide shot.`\n\n**Scene 8: The Enduring Legend**\n*   **Description:** A final, symbolic shot that represents the lasting legacy of the story.\n*   **Sora Prompt:** `A single ancient book in a dusty library. On its open page, illustrations of Catheria and Salome are not fighting, but dancing in a yin-yang formation among the stars. A whisper of light traces the artwork. Slow zoom, symbolic, poignant, magical.`"
