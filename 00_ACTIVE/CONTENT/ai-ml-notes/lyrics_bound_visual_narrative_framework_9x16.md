# 🎼 Lyrics-Bound Visual Narrative Framework (9:16 Vertical Format)

---

## 1. Core Principle

- Every image must be derived **strictly from the song’s lyrics, timestamps, and context**.  
- No external narrative or invented symbolism may appear.  
- **Typography is optional** — only used when naturally integrated into the scene.  
- All images must be **9:16 vertical aspect ratio (1080×1920)** for cinematic storytelling.

## 2. Song Analysis Phase

| Category | Description | Example |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Themes** | Core motifs recurring in lyrics | loss, rebirth, healing |
| **Emotions** | Dominant feeling progression | melancholic → hopeful |
| **Symbols** | Tangible or metaphorical objects | petals, mirror, dawn |
| **Narrative Arc** | Flow from intro → climax → resolution | heartbreak → reflection → renewal |

## 3. Narrative Image Framework (All 9:16)

### A. Main Image – Core Emotion
```
Title: {{song_title}} – Main Image
Visual: {{character_state_or_action}} expressed through {{symbolic_scene}}.
Lighting & Color: {{dramatic_palette}} emphasizing contrast between sorrow and hope.
Typography: "{{lyric_snippet}}" embedded into {{surface_type}} (e.g., graffiti, light reflection).
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (1080×1920)
Purpose: Capture the song’s emotional climax visually and symbolically.
```

### B. Transition Image – Symbolic Bridge
```
Title: {{song_title}} – Transition
Visual: Close-up of {{symbolic_object}} representing emotional shift.
Lighting & Color: Soft, muted tones fading into warmth or light.
Typography: Optional — subtle lyric fragment if directly related.
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (1080×1920)
Purpose: Bridge two lyrical moods with a symbolic visual cue.
```

### C. Filler Image – Reflection / Pause
```
Title: {{song_title}} – Filler
Visual: Atmospheric moment emphasizing reflection — {{object_from_lyric}} in {{environment_detail}}.
Lighting & Color: Warm, nostalgic hues; gentle gradients for emotional softness.
Typography: Optional faint script “{{reflective_line}}” integrated into objects or surfaces.
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (1080×1920)
Purpose: Emotional breathing space; visual meditation between lyrical highs and lows.
```

### D. Ambient / Closing Image – Resolution
```
Title: {{song_title}} – Resolution
Visual: Expansive scene of {{environment_or_landscape}} under changing light.
Lighting & Color: Transition from shadows to sunrise tones (symbolizing healing).
Typography: Optional lyric echo “{{closing_line}}” integrated into horizon or reflections.
Aspect Ratio: 9:16 (1080×1920)
Purpose: Conclude the narrative visually, embodying lyrical closure.
```

## 4. Batching & Iteration

- Always generate **4 images per batch** (Main, Transition, Filler, Ambient).  
- After each batch, propose **4 new lyric-rooted ideas** to expand the visual world:
```
1. {{expand_on_lyric_metaphor}}
2. {{explore_secondary_symbol}}
3. {{introduce_emotional_shift}}
4. {{alternate_perspective_or_angle}}
```
- Continue iterating until all lyrical sections are visually expressed.

## 5. Technical Defaults (9:16 Only)

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Aspect Ratio** | 9:16 (1080×1920) | Immersive, vertical cinematic storytelling |
| **Typography** | Optional, embedded in-scene | Never overlayed |
| **Lighting Flow** | Dark → Midtone → Bright | Mirrors lyrical emotion arc |
| **Backgrounds** | Simple, solid, or minimal | Emphasize subject clarity |
| **Continuation** | Always “DO” | Auto-continue batches unless paused |

---

## 6. Example: “PeTals FaLL (Remix) Yah Yah”

| Image | Description | Key Lyric |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| **Main** | Figure under falling petals, twilight garden, sorrowful stance | “Petals fall, yet roots remain” |
| **Transition** | Slow drift of single glowing petal | “Whispers of a distant song” |
| **Filler** | Empty park bench with scattered petals | “Beauty lies where none can see” |
| **Ambient** | Dawn horizon with dew-lit petals and faint silhouette | “Her truth illuminates the way” |

---

## 7. Automation Notes

- Designed for **DALL·E 3**, **DiGiTaL DiVe**, or similar systems.  
- Auto-inject placeholders from lyric parsing: `{{character_state_or_action}}`, `{{lyric_snippet}}`, etc.  
- Maintain **narrative consistency** in tone, color, and symbolism across all 9:16 frames.  
- Each output = **4 images + 4 new concept seeds** for expansion.
