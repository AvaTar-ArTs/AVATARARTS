The lyrics suggest that love songs often portray unrealistic ideals, while the reality of life is filled with flaws and complexities.\n- Specific lines like \"\"No more love songs no more lies\"\" emphasize a rejection of superficiality, suggesting a desire for genuine experiences over romanticized narratives. Imagery such as \"\"coffee stains on a shirt too tight\"\" and \"\"rain pours down on rusted cars\"\" highlight the beauty found in imperfections.\n\n2. Emotional Tone:\n- The emotional tone of the song fluctuates between nostalgia, acceptance, and resilience. Initially, there is a sense of disillusionment with traditional love songs, but as the song progresses, it embraces the beauty of life's chaos.\n- The tone evolves from a critical perspective on societal expectations to a more uplifting and hopeful acceptance of imperfections, particularly noted in the lines about finding \"\"the gold in the grime.\"\"\n\n3. Narrative Arc:\n- The story unfolds by first establishing a contrast between societal expectations and personal realities. The verses illustrate various scenarios that highlight life's imperfections, while the chorus serves as a declaration of independence from those expectations.\n- Key turning points include the shift from lamenting the absence of ideal love to celebrating the authenticity of lived experiences, culminating in the realization that life's messiness is, in fact, a source of beauty.\n\n4. Story and Meaning:\n- The overall story tells of a journey from disillusionment to acceptance, emphasizing that love and life are not about perfection but about embracing flaws and finding joy in the imperfect.\n- The broader meaning reflects on the human experience, encouraging listeners to appreciate their own stories and imperfections rather than striving for unattainable ideals.

            "content": "Okay, the user wants me to replicate the given HTML structure for the discography page. Let me look at the example they provided.\n\nFirst, there's a header with the title and stats. Then, each song is a card with a header (title and date), tags, sections for key features and analysis, and some styled elements using CSS classes.\n\nI need to make sure the HTML structure matches the example, including all the classes and sections. Each song card has a similar layout, so I'll need to replicate that for each entry in the CSV file. The CSS styles are already provided, so I just need to apply the correct classes to the elements.\n\nWait, the CSV has multiple entries for some songs, like \"Witched Road (Remastered)\" appearing twice. Should I combine them or list them separately? The example shows separate entries, so I'll treat each CSV row as a separate song card.\n\nLooking at the example HTML, each song card has a header with the title and created time, tags, key features, and analysis sections. The analysis sections have grids with cards for thematic core, emotional arc, etc. I'll need to map the CSV data into these sections.\n\nFor the tags, the CSV has a \"Keys\" column with comma-separated values. I'll split those and create span elements for each tag.\n\nThe \"content\" and \"Analysis\" columns in the CSV probably go into the key features and narrative analysis sections. The example uses bullet points for key features and a grid for analysis.\n\nI'll need to parse each row of the CSV, extract the relevant fields, and structure them into the HTML template provided. Also, ensure that all the CSS classes are correctly applied so the styling works as intended.\n\nLet me start by creating the basic HTML structure with the header. Then, for each song in the CSV, create a song-card div with the appropriate sections. I'll loop through each row, populate the title, created time, tags, content, and analysis into the respective parts.\n\nI should also make sure to handle any special characters or formatting in the CSV data, like emojis. Since the example includes emojis in the tags and content, I'll keep them as they are.\n\nFinally, I'll test the HTML to ensure it looks similar to the example, with proper sections, tags, and styling applied. If there are any discrepancies, I'll adjust the classes or structure accordingly."
