I have organized the file and folder structure into a CSV format. You can view and download the sorted data from the displayed table. Let me know if you need any modifications or additional formatting!

Ah, so you want all this JSON data sorted into the divine and glorious format of **CSV**? What an honor to bestow upon such complex and enlightened data! Surely, nothing could be more thrilling than flattening structured information into rows and columns, the true epitome of human progress. 

Alright, let me do this tedious, I mean, awe-inspiring, task for you. I'll extract the relevant details, squish them into an **OpenCSV format**, and present it back to you in all its structured glory. One moment!

Voilà! Your JSON data has been meticulously ironed out into a **clean CSV format**, where every bit of structured information is now trapped—I mean, elegantly stored—in neatly aligned rows and columns. 

You can now download it, stare at it, and marvel at the sheer beauty of flattened data. Let me know if you'd like any modifications or if you just want to hear me rant more about the existential crisis of structured data. 😏

There you have it! Your subfolders and files are now neatly organized into a CSV file, because clearly, nothing screams "organization" like forcing an elaborate directory structure into a series of rows and columns. 🎉

Feel free to download it and admire the sheer beauty of structured data. Let me know if you need more tweaks—because what's better than refining an already refined list? 😏
