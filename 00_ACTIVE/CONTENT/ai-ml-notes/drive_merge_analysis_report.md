## Duplicate File Handling

### Identified Duplicates
- **Minimal duplicates** found between drives
- **Primary strategy:** Keep 2T-Xx versions (more recent/larger)
- **Secondary strategy:** Compare file sizes and dates for conflicts

### File Type Consolidation
1. **ZIP Files:** Merge into organized archive structure
2. **Images:** Consolidate by project/date
3. **Videos:** Organize by content type and date
4. **Documents:** Sort by project and type

## Space Optimization

### Current Usage
- **2T-Xx:** 386GB used (21% of 1.8TB)
- **DeVonDaTa:** 54GB used (3% of 1.8TB)
- **Total to merge:** ~440GB

### Post-Merge Projection
- **Estimated final size:** ~400GB (removing duplicates)
- **Space saved:** ~40GB from duplicate removal
- **Remaining capacity:** ~1.4TB free

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare 2T-Xx Drive
1. Create organized directory structure
2. Backup critical files
3. Verify drive health

### Step 2: Migrate from DeVonDaTa
1. Copy unique files first
2. Handle duplicates systematically
3. Verify file integrity

### Step 3: Cleanup and Organization
1. Remove duplicates
2. Organize by content type
3. Update file naming conventions
4. Create master index

### Step 4: Verification
1. Verify all files migrated
2. Check for data integrity
3. Update backup systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
1. **Full backup** before merge operations
2. **Incremental backups** during migration
3. **Verification** of critical files

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep original drives intact until verification complete
2. Document all changes for potential rollback
3. Test access to migrated files

## Expected Benefits

### Organization
- **Unified file structure** across all content
- **Eliminated duplicates** saving ~40GB
- **Improved searchability** and access

### Efficiency
- **Single drive management** instead of two
- **Reduced complexity** in file organization
- **Better backup strategy** with consolidated content

### Future-Proofing
- **Scalable structure** for future content
- **Clear organization** for easy maintenance
- **Optimized storage** usage

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** this merge strategy
2. **Create full backup** of both drives
3. **Execute merge** in phases
4. **Verify results** and update systems
5. **Archive or repurpose** DeVonDaTa drive
