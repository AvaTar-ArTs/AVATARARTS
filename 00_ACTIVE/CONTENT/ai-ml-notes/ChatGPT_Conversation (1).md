[Intro, Fingerpicked guitar, Low drone]

[Male]

(Whispered) The night is breathing, waiting…



[Verse 1, Male voice, Guitar, Soft percussion]

Through shadows thick, a bitter bloom,

Vines curling in the half-lit room.

She calls me down, where silence weaves,

And secret roots beneath the eaves.

Heartbeats ripple, memory’s graves—

Cradled soft in ancient waves.



[Pre-Chorus, Male+Female harmonies]

Within the roots, our breath unwinds—

Darkness drawing spiral signs.



[Chorus, Both voices, Open chords, Hand drum]

Threaded through this moonlit veil,

Phi unwinds a silent trail.

One becomes the many still—

Drunk on stars against my will.

Crack me open, fold me wide,

Let the hidden worlds collide.



[Instrumental, Mandolin, Light percussion]



[Verse 2, Female lead, Male harmony]

Desert wind, the cactus crown,

Grandfather’s wisdom settling down.

Patterns etched in bone and thorn,

Lessons learned before we’re born.

Spores arise—a trickster’s code—

Paths that only mushrooms showed.

Laughter echoes through the gate,

Where quantum keys negotiate.



[Bridge, Rhythmic strumming, Both voices echoing]

Then snapped—Bufo sends me high,

Ego scattered, spirit sky.

No ground below, just sudden light,

Lost in song and tongues of night.

Kambo’s fire, water’s test,

Shadow’s purge and soul’s unrest.

Purge and shiver, shake and run—

Shadow falls before the sun.



[Final Chorus, Full harmony, Stomps, Claps]

Threaded through ancestral cries,

Time unwinds behind closed eyes.

Phi becomes a song I hear,

Etched in ribs, both far and near.

Strip me down, unravel, spun—

Till I’m gone and all is one.



[Outro, Guitar fades, Harmony hum]

A whisper left in forest breath—

More than life, and more than death.

Now woven through the sacred weave,

We sing what we no longer need to believe.

Male (whispered):
The night is breathing, waiting…

[Verse 1 – Male Voice, Guitar, Soft Percussion]
Through shadows thick, a bitter bloom,
Vines curling in the half-lit room.
She calls me down, where silence weaves,
And secret roots beneath the eaves.
Heartbeats ripple, memory’s graves—
Cradled soft in ancient waves.

Within the roots, our breath unwinds—
Darkness drawing spiral signs.

[Chorus – Both Voices, Open Chords, Hand Drum]

Phi unwinds a silent trail.
One becomes the many still—
Drunk on stars against my will.
Crack me open, fold me wide,
Let the hidden worlds collide.

[Verse 2 – Female Lead, Male Harmony]
Desert wind, the cactus crown,
Grandfather’s wisdom settling down.
Patterns etched in bone and thorn,
Lessons learned before we’re born.
Spores arise—a trickster’s code—
Paths that only mushrooms showed.
Laughter echoes through the gate,
Where quantum keys negotiate.

Shadow’s purge and soul’s unrest.
Purge and shiver, shake and run—
Shadow falls before the sun.

A whisper left in forest breath—
More than life, and more than death.
Now woven through the sacred weave,
We sing what we no longer need to believe.
