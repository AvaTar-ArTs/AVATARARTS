The reflections catch in the broken glass, fragmented and distorted, like the memories of a past relationship. The words **"Shattered Promises"** are faintly etched into the window frame, barely visible unless you’re looking closely. The quiet hum of the city reverberates in the background as if time is suspended in this moment, caught between something broken and something beautiful.

Beyond the fence, **graffiti hearts** glow faintly on the walls, half-hidden behind layers of grime and time. The words **"Midnight Whispers"** are spray-painted in jagged letters across the fence, the neon glow from nearby signs reflecting off the sharp edges of the wire. Two figures stand on either side of the fence—one leaning casually against the metal, laughing softly, while the other stands with head bowed, hands in their pockets, lost in thought. The **barbed wire** separates them, both physically and emotionally, yet there’s a sense of connection that lingers in the air, heavy with unspoken words.
