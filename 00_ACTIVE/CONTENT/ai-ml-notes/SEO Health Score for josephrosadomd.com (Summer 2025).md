Here’s what I need:

* Together with the steps you recommended at the end of the written analysis you sent me yesterday...

  * Merge and streamline [josephrosadomd.com](http://josephrosadomd.com/) and International Medical Consultants, Inc. into a unified “Dr. Joe 2.0” brand/site, although ChatGPT recommended that I merge them via backlinking, but keep them separate since each represents a different area in my life/career. What do you think?
  * Set up a lead and funnel system that integrates my Twilio number (505-DrJoe20) for HIPAA-compliant calls, SMS, and call recording with stellar AI support, since I will no longer be using HighLevel based on your demonstration and explanation yesterday.
  * Establish a simple, secure (HIPPA complaint) EMR or patient note workflow for remote consulting and management.
  * Prioritize a professional, user-friendly launchpad ready for growth.

* I took the liberty of asking ChatGPT this: based on your findings, on a scale of 0-10, what's the status of my website now?

  And this was the reply:

  **Based on your site’s current public signals and what’s visible in the source (not a full crawl, but from Google, PageSpeed, and general on-page audit):**

  | Category                            | Score (0–10) | Comment                                                      |
  | ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Technical SEO / Indexing            | 7            | Clean basic structure; needs canonical/tag improvements.     |
  | On-page Optimization (meta, schema) | 6            | Decent; lacks rich schema & some descriptions too short/long. |
  | Content Depth & Uniqueness          | 7            | Medical/cannabis content is unique, but needs more FAQ/longform. |
  | Backlinks & Authority               | 5            | Link profile thin for the niche; needs more diverse sources. |
  | Performance (speed, mobile, a11y)   | 6            | Loads OK, but images unoptimized; some accessibility gaps.   |
  | Local SEO & E-E-A-T                 | 7            | Good GBP profile, but schema and review integration could improve. |
  | Trend Alignment (2025)              | 4            | Behind on video, zero-click, and trending keywords.          |

  ### **Average: ≈** **6/10**

  **Verdict:**
  Your site is in a solid place for 2023-2024 best practices, but needs serious updates for 2025’s top 5% tier. That means:

  * More structured data (especially FAQ, Service, and Physician schema)
  * Authority-building through better backlinks
  * Adoption of rising search trends (“ketamine for depression,” zero-click optimization, video, and local “near me” language)
  * Performance tune-up (image formats, mobile tweaks)
  * More visible E-E-A-T (reviews, credentials, case studies, FAQ)

  **With focused work on these areas, you can realistically move to an 8 or 9/10 within 2–3 months** and dominate your specialty regionally and even nationally for hot medical queries.

  *And this is the follow up recommendation: Want to see a prioritized 30-day action plan to jump from 6 to 8+? Or a “before and after” meta/schema code for one of your main landing pages?*

  Since I have to wait for the present company to complete our arrangement, I'd like to start ramping up my "new" website: [drjoe2point0.com](http://drjoe2point0.com/) the social media connections, plus posting schedules for all of the social media platforms. As well as linking my new phone to my website.

* Also Did some fine tuning of your info, seo, stats etc..

  I hope you enjoy!
