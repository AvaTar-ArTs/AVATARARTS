Sure! Please go ahead and paste the song lyrics or transcript you'd like me to analyze. Once I have that, I can help extract the visual themes, scenes, or symbols to create a prompt for DALL·E image generation. Let me know if you’re going for a realistic, surreal, abstract, cartoonish, or any other style too!

Awesome vibe! You’ve nailed that blend of techy functionality with a splash of storybook whimsy, comic flair, and just the right edge of dark humor. Let’s run with it and expand the theme with more playful filename ideas and some YouTube title variants that could totally suit a devlog, UI design showcase, or AI tool reveal.

Want some of these reimagined as actual DALL·E image prompts too? I can cook up some narrative comic panels, UI mockups in illustrated styles, or icon design prompts to match any of the filenames. Just say the word. 😎

Yeah, totally — if you're aiming to make this into a **default prompt template** (like a go-to for generating playful, stylistic filenames or YouTube titles around UI/tech concepts), we can generalize it while still keeping the flavor intact. Here's a refined version:

---

### ⚙️ **Default Prompt Template: Playful Tech Naming / Titles**

> **Prompt:**
>  
> Generate a list of **creative, playful filenames or YouTube titles** based on the following tech-related concept:  
>  
> _“[Insert brief description of the UI feature, tool, or functionality — e.g., search interface, AI chatbot, animation tool, dashboard, etc.]”_  
>  
> The naming should include a mix of the following themes:
> - **Whimsical / Fairytale** (e.g., storybook vibes, enchanted tools, magical metaphors)
> - **Dark Humor / Cyberpunk Grit** (e.g., dramatic, ironic, slightly absurd or edgy)
> - **Comic Book / Superhero-Inspired** (e.g., bold, illustrated, exaggerated fun)

> Filenames should sound like quirky project files (e.g., `.svg`, `.jsx`, `.ai`, etc.).  
> YouTube titles should be click-worthy but still themed appropriately — imagine a designer/developer sharing a devlog or reveal.

> Provide at least 3 filename ideas and 3 YouTube title ideas for each tone above.

---

### 🔁 Optional Additions for Variation:

You can also prompt like this:
> Mix in some references to:
> - Classic fantasy tropes
> - Hacker culture / retro tech
> - Animated Saturday morning cartoons
> - Internet-era memes or Gen Z humor

Or specify:
> Style = [Comic | Whimsical | Dark Humor | Retro-Futuristic | Dystopian Satire]  
> Output format = [List | Table | JSON object | Markdown sectioned]

---

### 💡 Example Usage:
> **Prompt:**
> "Generate filename and YouTube title ideas based on a user interface that visualizes user queries as a magical map."  
> **Style:** Whimsical + Dark Humor + Comic Book  
> **Format:** Markdown sections

Would you like me to turn this into a reusable script or API prompt as well (for consistent usage with your apps, Python scripts, or GPT calls)?

Ah got it — you're looking for a **compact, reusable optional prompt** for **PopClip’s GPT plugin** — something that fits nicely into that "Optional Prompt" field to be prepended before the selected text.

Here’s a clean version tailored for that:

---

**Optional Prompt for PopClip GPT Plugin (Playful Tech Naming):**

> Generate creative, playful filenames and YouTube titles based on the following text. Include a mix of whimsical, dark humor, and comic-book themes. Filenames should sound like quirky project files (.svg, .js, etc). YouTube titles should feel like fun devlog or tool showcase content.

---

It’s short enough to work well in PopClip’s field and flexible enough to handle a wide range of inputs. If you want variations or presets (e.g., for different moods or branding themes), I can format a few of those too. Want them?
