> In a moody, neon-lit alley soaked in midnight rain, a grungy raccoon singer n, Sammy, a middle-aged male dressed in a rustic vest and jeans, strums his guitar with fervor, the moon casting a soft glow on his face. The raccoon with the banjo plays enthusiastically beside him. The alley is filled with an audience of various small nocturnal animals, all captivated by the performance.

This sounds like a wonderfully atmospheric scene!
