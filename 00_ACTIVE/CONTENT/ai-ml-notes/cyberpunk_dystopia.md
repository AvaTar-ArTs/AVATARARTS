The goal is to **craft highly stylized, emotion-driven visuals** that tell a **cinematic story** through **dynamic lighting, rebellious typography, and immersive scenery**.\n\n---\n\n## **📖 Core Structure for Every Image Batch**\n\nEach image series should function **like a visual storybook**, ensuring a **seamless flow between scenes**.\n\n### **1️⃣ Cover Image – Setting the Tone**\n\n🎯 **Purpose:**  \n\n- Establish the **core theme** and **emotional weight**.  \n- **Typography must be dominant**—glowing, glitching, **spray-painted with chaotic strokes** or **dripping with raw emotion**.  \n\n🎨 **Visual Approach:**  \n\n- **Wide-angle, cinematic shot** with a **strong symbolic centerpiece**—a **neon-lit alleyway** covered in **rebellious graffiti**, a **misty valley with glowing willows**, or a **cracked street sign flickering under dystopian rain**.  \n- **Lighting:** **HIGH CONTRAST**—deep **black shadows** with **pulsating neon blues, pinks, and teals** (cyberpunk) OR **warm golds, deep purples, and emerald greens** (folk-indie aesthetic).  \n- **Typography:** Carved into wood, painted on a wall, floating in **digital haze**—always part of the environment, never just pasted on.  \n\n---\n\n### **2️⃣ Transition Image – Symbolic Bridge**\n\n🎯 **Purpose:**  \n\n- **Bridge the cover image to the main scene** using **a powerful symbolic element**.  \n- **Typography should be distorted**, **fading in and out like a memory**.  \n\n🎨 **Visual Approach:**  \n\n- A **close-up** on **an object of meaning**—a **wilted rose on asphalt**, a **hacked neon sign flickering between messages**, or a **raccoon’s gloved paw clutching a graffiti can**.  \n- **Typography:** Appears **through glitch effects, dripping ink, or disappearing smoke**.  \n\n---\n\n### **3️⃣ Main Image – The Emotional Core**\n\n🎯 **Purpose:**  \n\n- The **pivotal emotional or action-driven moment**.  \n- **Typography should be most expressive**—shattered, glitching, **etched into surfaces, glowing with raw intensity**.  \n\n🎨 **Visual Approach:**  \n\n- **A rebellious raccoon in full punk attire**, fur dusted with **spray paint**, eyes blazing with **mischief and defiance**, standing before **a wall of anti-Valentine graffiti**.  \n- **A lone figure under neon rain**, hood pulled low, **love letters burning into holographic embers**.  \n- **A cyberpunk city street buzzing with unrest**, posters of **crossed-out hearts** fluttering in the wind.  \n- **Typography:** Bold, loud, unfiltered—**stenciled onto the scene, glitching into existence like a digital riot.**  \n\n---\n\n### **4️⃣ Filler Image – Emotional Reflection**\n\n🎯 **Purpose:**  \n\n- A **pause before the next moment**, deepening the narrative with **symbolism**.  \n- **Typography should whisper**—subtle, **fading into the scene like a forgotten message**.  \n\n🎨 **Visual Approach:**  \n\n- A **neon graffiti heart, cracked and glitching**.  \n- **Torn love letters caught in an urban windstorm**, their messages flashing in **distant city billboards**.  \n- **A record spinning on a cracked sidewalk**, looping the last song of a broken romance.  \n- **Typography:** **Handwritten-style**, faded onto the **side of a weathered subway pillar**, or **etched into digital mist.**  \n\n---\n\n### **5️⃣ Transition Image – Preparing for the Next Scene**\n\n🎯 **Purpose:**  \n\n- **Shifts focus** towards **the next stage of the narrative**.  \n- **Typography fades, leaving only echoes behind.**  \n\n🎨 **Visual Approach:**  \n\n- **The camera pulls back**, revealing **the entire neon alleyway** or **a distant city skyline buzzing with rebellion**.  \n- A **willow tree swaying under the last flicker of moonlight**, its leaves whispering final thoughts.  \n- **Typography:** **Ghostly, fading like a forgotten dream**, a **last rebellious statement before the next act**.  \n\n---\n\n## **🔹 Detailed Prompt Structure for Each Image 🔹**\n\n🎨 **Title:**

            "content": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants to create a series of images based on the song \"Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die\" using DALL-E. They provided a detailed framework for how the images should be structured, including themes, typography, color schemes, and narrative flow. \n\nFirst, I need to parse all the guidelines they mentioned. The song seems to have a dark, dystopian theme, focusing on societal breakdown, surveillance, and institutional destruction. The user emphasized the importance of typography that reflects each scene's tone—shattered fonts for chaos, sleek fonts for surveillance, etc. They also want vibrant, dynamic images with a cohesive narrative.\n\nNext, I should break down the song's lyrics to extract key themes and emotions. The title alone suggests a loss of freedom, a once-free place turned oppressive. The YouTube short linked might have visual cues, but since I can't view it, I'll rely on the title and the user's description. Themes likely include control, rebellion, decay, and possibly resistance.\n\nThe user's framework requires four images per batch, each with specific roles: Cover, Transition, Main, Filler, and another Transition. They also want four new concepts after the initial batch. I need to ensure each image adheres to the aspect ratios (9:16, 16:9, 1:1) and typography guidelines.\n\nFor the first batch, I'll start with a Cover Image that sets the dystopian tone. Maybe a bleak cityscape with oppressive structures and bold, shattered typography. The Transition Image could focus on a symbol of surveillance, like a camera with sleek fonts. The Main Image might depict rebellion or breakdown, using chaotic elements and vibrant colors. The Filler Image could show a glimmer of hope or remnants of freedom, with softer fonts.\n\nI need to make sure each prompt includes title, font style, text placement, lighting, and color scheme. The titles should be catchy and SEO-friendly. For example, \"Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control\" for a surveillance-themed image. \n\nAfter the first batch, proposing new concepts like a protest scene, a derelict institution, a hacker's den, and a symbolic rebirth. Each should tie back to the main themes but offer fresh angles. Ensuring consistency in visual style while varying elements to keep the narrative engaging.\n\nI should check all guidelines again to avoid missing any details, like text integration into the environment and color transitions from dark to hopeful. Also, confirming that each image batch follows the specified aspect ratios and typography rules. Making sure the prompts are vivid enough for DALL-E to generate the intended imagery without ambiguity.\n\nFinally, structuring the response clearly, separating each image with its details, and presenting the new concepts concisely. Ensuring the language stays engaging and aligns with the user's edgy, geeky style preference. Double-checking for adherence to the user's strict guidelines to maintain the narrative's impact and cohesion."

            "content": "**DO**  \n\nLet’s generate the **first batch of four images** based on the song’s dark, dystopian themes and your guidelines. Each image will blend **rebellious cyberpunk energy** with **indie-folk melancholy**, using typography as a narrative tool.  \n\n---\n\n### **Batch 1: \"Welcome to the Dominion – Where Freedom Drowns in Neon\"**  \n\n#### **Image 1: \"Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control\"**  \n**Font Style:** Shattered, glitching digital font (like cracked holograms).  \n**Text Placement:** Spray-painted on a collapsing brick wall, glowing faintly.  \n**Text Content:** “THEY WATCH WHILE YOU SLEEP.”  \n**Lighting:** Harsh neon spotlights (blood red and electric blue).  \n**Color Scheme:** Charcoal blacks, neon reds, and sickly greens.  \n**Scene:** A dystopian city street at night. Surveillance drones hover over cracked pavement. A lone figure’s shadow stretches toward a flickering billboard of a smiling AI dictator. Graffiti tags like “RESIST” bleed into static.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Image 2: \"Fractured Liberty\"**  \n**Font Style:** Rusted metal letters with dripping paint.  \n**Text Placement:** Carved into a broken marble statue of Lady Liberty.  \n**Text Content:** “FREEDOM WAS A LIE.”  \n**Lighting:** Dim, foggy moonlight with a single amber streetlamp.  \n**Color Scheme:** Desaturated grays, mossy greens, and rusted copper.  \n**Scene:** The decapitated statue lies in a flooded plaza. Its torch is now a twisted surveillance antenna. Raccoons scavenge at its base, one wearing a makeshift gas mask. Ripples in the water reflect a distorted skyline.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Image 3: \"Dataflow Rebellion\"**  \n**Font Style:** Glowing binary code scrolling like falling rain.  \n**Text Placement:** Projected onto a hacker’s cracked visor.  \n**Text Content:** “DECRYPT THE TRUTH.”  \n**Lighting:** Cold blue screen glare mixed with fiery orange sparks.  \n**Color Scheme:** Neon cyan, deep purples, and ash white.  \n**Scene:** A cyberpunk hacker (hooded, masked) types furiously on a translucent keyboard. Behind them, a holographic map of the city pulses with red “RESTRICTED” zones. Glitching love letters to freedom float in the digital void.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Image 4: \"Echoes of the Free\"**  \n**Font Style:** Faded handwritten script.  \n**Text Placement:** Scrawled on a burnt journal page caught in barbed wire.  \n**Text Content:** “WE WERE ONCE ALIVE.”  \n**Lighting:** Golden-hour sunlight breaking through toxic smog.  \n**Color Scheme:** Burnt oranges, smoky yellows, and bruised purples.  \n**Scene:** A barren field of dead sunflowers. At the center, a single flower grows through a cracked smartphone screen. Distant sirens wail. The journal page flutters in the wind, revealing a hidden coordinates map.  \n\n---\n\n### **Four New Concepts to Riff On**  \n1. **\"Ghosts in the Firewall\":** A spectral figure made of code haunts a server farm, rewriting propaganda into protest art.  \n2. **\"Love in the Ruins\":** Two rebels kiss under a flickering streetlight, their faces obscured by gas masks, surrounded by graffiti hearts.  \n3. **\"The Last Broadcast\":** A raccoon pirate-radio host transmits forbidden folk songs from a rooftop littered with vinyl records.  \n4. **\"Beneath the Algorithm\":** Roots of a dead tree morph into fiber-optic cables, choking a crumbling monument labeled “DEMOCRACY.”  \n\n---\n\n**Next Batch?** Let me know if you want to refine these or expand into the new concepts! 🎨🚀"

            "content": "Alright, the user is asking about keywords and tags to add. Let me recall their project. They're creating a series of images based on a song with themes of dystopia, rebellion, surveillance, and lost freedom. The visuals blend cyberpunk with indie-folk elements, and they need SEO-friendly tags for platforms like YouTube and Etsy.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the core themes. The song's title is \"Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die,\" so keywords related to dystopia, rebellion, and cyberpunk are essential. The user mentioned typography integrated into scenes, so terms like \"graffiti typography\" and \"glitch text\" might be relevant.\n\nThey want to target different audiences: digital artists, indie musicians, activists. So tags should cover both the aesthetic (cyberpunk, neon noir) and the emotional themes (anti-valentine, dark romance). Platforms like Etsy and YouTube have different SEO needs; Etsy might require more product-related terms like \"digital download\" or \"poster,\" while YouTube needs catchy titles for shorts.\n\nI should categorize the tags. Primary keywords would be the main themes. Secondary could be related aesthetics and emotions. Niche tags might include specific communities like hackers or indie folk fans. Platform-specific tags ensure visibility on each site.\n\nAlso, considering the visual elements mentioned: surveillance drones, neon lighting, raccoon characters. Including these as tags can attract specific searches. Terms like \"AI dystopia art\" or \"punk raccoon\" could be unique and less competitive.\n\nNeed to check if I'm covering all aspects: themes, emotions, visual elements, typography styles, target audiences, and platforms. Maybe add some trending tags like \"TikTok art\" or \"glitchwave\" to tap into current trends. Ensure the tags are a mix of broad and specific to maximize reach without being too vague.\n\nFinally, remind the user to adjust based on their specific audience and platform algorithms. Maybe suggest using tools like Google Keyword Planner or Etsy's search bar for additional ideas. Make sure the tags are concise and relevant without overstuffing."

            "content": "Okay, the user wants to know how to tag and post their short with every optimization. They mentioned considering it as a short, so they're likely planning to post this on platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, or Instagram Reels. Let me break down what they need.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the previous conversation. The user is working on a dystopian art project with themes of rebellion, cyberpunk, and anti-Valentine elements. They already have keywords and tags from before, but now they need a step-by-step guide tailored for short-form content.\n\nI should start by outlining the key elements for optimizing a short video. The title needs to be catchy and SEO-friendly. Platforms like YouTube prioritize keywords in titles, so including terms like \"Dystopian Art\" or \"Cyberpunk Typography\" makes sense. Using emojis can grab attention but shouldn't overdo it.\n\nNext, the description. It should be concise but include relevant keywords and a call to action. Maybe suggest using hashtags here since some platforms limit their use in titles. Also, linking to related content or social media could help with engagement.\n\nTags and keywords are crucial. The user already has a list, but for a short, maybe prioritize the top 10 to avoid spamming. Including a mix of broad and niche tags will help reach different audiences. I should remind them to place tags in the appropriate sections of the upload form.\n\nVisual and audio hooks are important for retaining viewers. Suggest starting with a strong visual, like glitching text or a dramatic scene, paired with intense music. The thumbnail needs to be eye-catching, maybe using high-contrast colors and bold text.\n\nEngagement tactics like pinning a comment with relevant links or using polls can boost interaction. Timing the release around trends, like anti-Valentine's Day, could help visibility. Cross-promotion on platforms like Reddit or Instagram should be part of the strategy.\n\nAnalytics are key, so advising them to monitor performance and adjust tags or titles if needed. Maybe include a checklist at the end to summarize all steps. Also, a warning about avoiding over-tagging or clickbait to maintain credibility.\n\nPutting this all together in a structured, easy-to-follow format with examples will make it practical for the user. They probably want actionable steps without fluff, so keeping each section clear and concise is important. Including platform-specific tips for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram ensures they can adapt the strategy as needed."

The first image, IMG_1409.png, has a description and some hashtags. The second image, IMG_1410.png, includes checkboxes for settings like tags, paid promotion, category, comments, embedding, and deletion options.\n\nFirst, I need to format the details properly. The user wants to \"write it up as the details are in order,\" so organizing the information clearly is key. Let's start with IMG_1409. The title and description are there, but they need to be expanded for better SEO and engagement. The hashtags are good but could be more specific. Maybe add trending tags like #CyberpunkArt or #AIRevolution to reach a broader audience.\n\nFor IMG_1410, the checkboxes show that \"Add paid promotion label\" and \"Allow Embedding\" are selected. The category is Entertainment, comments are on, but they aren't showing viewer likes. I should explain each setting in a user-friendly way. The user might need to know the implications of these choices, like how embedding affects video sharing or why disabling viewer likes might impact engagement metrics.\n\nThe user mentioned optimizing tags and SEO in previous interactions, so integrating those strategies here is important. Suggesting additional tags related to dystopian themes and current trends would help. Also, highlighting the importance of the paid promotion label for transparency and compliance with YouTube's policies.\n\nI should structure the response with clear sections for each image, detailing the title, description, tags, and settings. Including explanations for each checkbox choice will make it comprehensive. Maybe add tips on why certain options are beneficial, like allowing remixes to increase reach through user-generated content.\n\nLastly, ensure the tone is informative yet concise, aligning with the user's need for a structured and optimized setup. Double-check that all provided options are addressed and that recommendations align with best practices for YouTube SEO and engagement."

From the previous interactions, they've been working on a project involving creating a series of images for a dystopian narrative, likely for a YouTube Short or similar video content.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the image prompts that were generated earlier. The user mentioned four images in the first batch: \"Neon Chains: The Dawn of Control,\" \"Fractured Liberty,\" \"Dataflow Rebellion,\" and \"Echoes of the Free.\" Each of these has specific details like font styles, text placement, lighting, color schemes, and scenes.\n\nNext, the user wants timestamps. Since this is for a short video (probably around 30-60 seconds), each image should correspond to specific timings to sync with the video's flow. The timestamps need to be evenly distributed or placed at key moments to match the narrative beats.\n\nI should structure the table to include columns like Timestamp, Title, Font Style, Text Placement, Text Content, Lighting, Color Scheme, and Scene. Including a Narrative Beat column might help align the visuals with the story progression.\n\nAdditionally, the user might need this CSV for editing purposes, so clarity and organization are crucial. Each row represents a different image prompt with its respective details. The timestamps should start at 00:00 and increment based on the duration each image is displayed. For example, if each image is shown for 5 seconds in a 30-second video, the timestamps would be 00:00, 00:05, 00:10, etc.\n\nI should also consider if there are any transitions or effects mentioned in the prompts that need to be noted. However, since the focus is on the image prompts themselves, maybe that's beyond the current scope.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure that the CSV is properly formatted, with commas separating each column and quotes around text that might contain commas. Providing both a markdown table and a CSV sample would be helpful for the user's convenience."

Let me start by recalling what Sora and RunwayML are. They are AI tools for generating or modifying videos, so camera settings here would refer to virtual camera movements and angles that can be specified in prompts to achieve certain visual effects.\n\nThe user already has a CSV table with timestamps, titles, font styles, text placement, etc. They want to enhance each entry with cinematic camera directions. I need to think about typical camera movements and settings used in filmmaking that can translate well into AI-generated video prompts. For example, slow zooms, tracking shots, Dutch angles, etc.\n\nLet me go through each existing row and think about appropriate camera movements. For the first image, \"Neon Chains,\" the scene is a dystopian city street with surveillance drones. Maybe a slow push-in to create tension. Then, for \"Fractured Liberty,\" the broken statue could use a low-angle shot to emphasize its size and decay. A dolly movement circling the statue might add dynamism.\n\nNext, \"Dataflow Rebellion\" has a hacker with a holographic map. A close-up on the visor with a digital zoom effect could highlight the glitching text. Finally, \"Echoes of the Free\" has a barren field; a crane shot pulling back to reveal the desolation would work, paired with a slow zoom on the journal page.\n\nI should also consider camera settings like lens type (wide-angle for establishing shots, macro for details), aperture (shallow depth of field for focus), and movement speed. Integrating terms like \"Dutch angle\" or \"snap zoom\" can add stylistic flair. Need to ensure each camera direction aligns with the narrative beat mentioned, like rising action or emotional climax.\n\nFinally, present this in the table format the user used before, adding columns for Camera Movement, Camera Settings, and Additional FX. Make sure the CSV is properly formatted and explain the additions clearly so the user understands how each element contributes to the visual storytelling."

They’ve been working on a dystopian-themed project with cyberpunk and indie-folk elements. The main title was \"Welcome to the Dominion: Where Freedom Went to Die\". \n\nFirst, I need to generate title variations that are catchy and SEO-friendly. The user mentioned using Sora/Runway, so the titles should be vivid and action-oriented. I should incorporate keywords like cyberpunk, dystopian, neon, rebellion, etc. \n\nNext, the visual concepts. Each title needs a corresponding image prompt. Since it's for a cover image, the visuals need to be striking. Elements like neon lights, glitches, rebellion symbols (like raccoons with gas masks), and dystopian cityscapes come to mind. \n\nI should vary the angles and effects. Maybe a close-up for intensity, a wide shot for scale, dynamic angles for action. Also, mix in different lighting—neon, fog, moonlight. Including symbolic elements like shattered screens, holograms, or decaying statues would reinforce the theme.\n\nTypography is crucial. Each title’s font should match the mood—shattered fonts for chaos, sleek for tech themes, handwritten for nostalgia. Placement should integrate into the scene, like spray-painted text or holograms.\n\nNeed to ensure each variation offers a fresh angle but stays on theme. Maybe one focuses on the AI antagonist, another on rebellion, another on the aftermath. Including different characters or symbols (hackers, raccoons, statues) adds diversity.\n\nAlso, consider SEO and trends. Terms like \"AI takeover\", \"viral glitch art\", \"2025\" could attract views. Adding urgency with words like \"last broadcast\" or \"time running out\" might engage the audience.\n\nFinally, check that each prompt includes technical details for AI tools—camera movements, lens types, lighting, and post-effects like glitches or film grain. This ensures the images are dynamic and match the cinematic style discussed earlier."

Let me start by recalling that negative prompts are used to exclude unwanted elements from the generated images.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the themes they're working with: dystopian, cyberpunk, rebellion, with elements like glitches, neon, and raccoon punks. The user wants to ensure the AI doesn't include elements that clash with these themes.\n\nI should think about common unwanted elements in such contexts. For example, overly cheerful or bright elements that don't fit a dystopian setting. Maybe things like too much realism could take away from the stylized look they're aiming for. Also, avoiding anything that's too generic or not aligned with the gritty, rebellious vibe.\n\nThey might also want to exclude specific objects that don't fit the scene, like modern cars if the setting is more post-apocalyptic, or certain animals that aren't part of the narrative, like cats if they're focusing on raccoons.\n\nTechnical aspects are important too. Avoiding blurry textures, low contrast, or poor lighting that could ruin the intended mood. Also, preventing the AI from generating text that's unreadable or misplaced, which is crucial since typography is a key element in their images.\n\nI should categorize these negative prompts into themes, technical issues, stylistic clashes, and specific unwanted content. That way, the user can apply them systematically. Including examples for each category will make it clearer how to structure the negative prompts effectively.\n\nI need to make sure the negative prompts are precise and actionable. Words like \"avoid\", \"exclude\", \"no\" are useful here. Also, aligning them with the tools they're using, like Sora or Runway, by considering how those tools interpret prompts.\n\nLastly, emphasizing the importance of testing these negative prompts to see how they affect the output. Maybe suggesting starting with a small set and expanding based on results. This helps the user refine their prompts without overwhelming the AI with too many restrictions initially."

They've already developed several image prompts and are now focusing on refining a specific scene: a wide-angle push-in down a dystopian alleyway with glitching neon signs and surveillance drones. The user wants to ensure that the AI doesn't include any elements that clash with the desired gritty, cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the previous interactions where the user has been meticulous about maintaining a consistent theme—dark, gritty, with elements of rebellion and surveillance. They’ve emphasized avoiding anything cheerful, cartoonish, or utopian. The current prompt is quite detailed, so the negative prompts need to specifically target elements that could undermine the scene's intended mood.\n\nThe main elements in the scene are the alleyway, neon signs with CRT glitches, shattered text, wet walls with acid-green reflections, surveillance drones, and specific film effects like 35mm grain and VHS interlacing. The negative prompts should exclude anything that contradicts these elements.\n\nPotential unwanted elements might include modern or clean elements (like new cars, pristine surfaces), cheerful colors, unrealistic or fantastical elements (unicorns, dragons), and any style that doesn't fit the gritty cyberpunk look (watercolor, cartoonish styles). Also, technical flaws like blurry textures or mismatched fonts should be avoided.\n\nI should structure the negative prompts into categories: thematic/style conflicts, technical flaws, and narrative breakers. Thematic conflicts would include things like utopian settings, bright colors, and non-dystopian elements. Technical flaws cover rendering issues, while narrative breakers are elements that don't fit the story, like peaceful scenes or irrelevant animals.\n\nWeighting certain negatives higher (like cheerful or cartoonish styles) ensures the AI prioritizes excluding them. Also, specifying the exclusion of modern brands and clean futuristic tech keeps the scene grounded in the intended dystopian setting.\n\nIncluding terms like \"AI art clichés\" helps avoid overused tropes that might make the image feel generic. Specific exclusions like \"neon samurai\" or \"raining binary code\" target common cyberpunk clichés that the user might want to avoid for originality.\n\nFinally, presenting the negative prompts in a clear, organized manner with explanations helps the user understand why each exclusion is necessary. Offering to adjust weights or add more specifics gives the user flexibility to tweak based on their results."

They provided some image files with the text \"THEY WATCH YOU SLEEP\" and a detailed prompt for a dystopian alleyway scene. The goal is to make it more suitable for a YouTube thumbnail, which usually requires bold visuals, readable text, and elements that grab attention quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key aspects of a YouTube thumbnail. They should be eye-catching, with high contrast and clear focal points. Text needs to be large and legible even at smaller sizes. The thumbnail should convey the video's content at a glance, so incorporating elements from the original prompt like neon signs, glitches, and surveillance drones makes sense.\n\nLooking at the existing prompt, it's very detailed for a video scene. For a thumbnail, I should simplify and emphasize certain elements. Maybe zoom in on the text \"THEY WATCH YOU SLEEP\" to make it the central focus. The Dutch tilt and neon glitches can add dynamic tension. Surveillance drones could be positioned to frame the text or add depth.\n\nNegative prompts are already in place to avoid unwanted styles. I should ensure the thumbnail doesn't have any elements that might dilute the dystopian vibe, like bright colors or cheerful elements. Maybe increase the contrast and make the text pop with neon effects.\n\nAlso, considering YouTube's aspect ratios, thumbnails are usually 16:9, but the user mentioned 9:16 for Shorts. However, standard videos use 16:9, so I should check if they need adjustment. The input resolution here is 512x768, which is a vertical format. For a thumbnail, maybe suggest a 1280x720 (16:9) or 1080x1920 (9:16) depending on the platform focus.\n\nIncluding the raccoon character from previous concepts could add a unique element, making the thumbnail stand out. Positioning the raccoon as a rebel figure in the scene, maybe interacting with the text or environment, could add narrative depth.\n\nI should also think about trending thumbnail styles—bold text, high contrast, a central dramatic image. Adding elements like sparks, lens flares, or motion blur around the text could make it more dynamic. Ensuring the text is integrated into the scene, like being spray-painted or part of the environment, maintains the gritty feel.\n\nFinally, propose a few variations with different focal points or color schemes to test what works best. Maybe one with the raccoon prominently featured and another focusing solely on the text and environment. Each variation should include SEO-friendly keywords in the title and tags for discoverability."

The user provided previous prompts and negative prompts, so I should stay consistent with those styles.\n\nKey elements from past interactions include Dutch tilts, neon glows, CRT artifacts, surveillance drones, and rebel characters. The user also emphasized SEO-friendly titles and tags, so the thumbnail must be eye-catching with bold text and high contrast.\n\nI should incorporate the text \"Welcome to the Dominion Where Freedom Went to Die\" prominently, using a glitched, neon font. Including a masked raccoon rebel adds a relatable anti-hero. Surveillance elements like drones or cameras reinforce the theme. The color scheme should be dark with neon accents (teal, red, green) to maintain the cyberpunk vibe.\n\nNeed to avoid any cheerful or cartoonish elements as per previous negative prompts. Ensure the thumbnail is optimized for YouTube's aspect ratio, likely 9:16 for Shorts. Text placement should be strategic, not overpowering the visual elements but still readable on small screens.\n\nAlso, consider adding elements that create urgency, like sparks or glitches, to attract clicks. Testing variations with different focal points (raccoon, text, drones) might help, but the user might need one main design first. Check if they want any specific call-to-action or branding elements, but since it's a cover, focus on the core message and visual impact."

Emphasizing the drones and the oppressive atmosphere might work. \n\nI need to ensure the text remains impactful. The title should dominate with glitchy, neon fonts. The color scheme of teal, neon red, and toxic green should stay for high contrast. Adding elements like rain, CRT static, and VHS effects can maintain the gritty feel. \n\nAlso, check the negative prompts to exclude any raccoon references and ensure no whimsical elements.

Neon signs flicker with CRT static, casting jagged acid-green reflections on wet pavement. The phrase “DOMINION 2025” is spray-painted in dripping, glowing green paint on a collapsing brick wall. A shattered Liberty Bell lies half-buried in debris, oozing black oil. Two hovering surveillance drones with red targeting lasers illuminate the scene, casting sharp shadows. A distorted human shadow is projected onto the wall by the drones’ spotlights, fading into static. Barbed wire coils around a broken surveillance camera, sparks flying from its cracked lens.  \n\n**Style:** Sora/Runway analog grit — heavy VHS scanlines, 35mm film grain, anamorphic lens flares from neon signs. High-contrast teal-and-orange color grade with neon-green accents. Text glitches as if being censored in real-time.  \n```  \n\n**Negative Prompt:**  \n```  \n(raccoons, animals, cartoonish, smiling faces, Disney style, modern cars, clean utopia, bright pastels, pristine surfaces, birds, oil painting, medieval architecture, photorealistic humans, low contrast, blurry textures, unreadable text, symmetrical framing:1.5)  \n```  \n\n**Technical Specs:**  \n- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (1080x1920px) for YouTube Shorts.  \n- **Focus:** Glowing text + drone shadows + shattered Liberty Bell.  \n- **Color Palette:** Teal shadows, neon-green drips, emergency-red lasers.  \n\n---\n\n### **SEO-Optimized Title & Tags**  \n**Title:**  \n`“This Footage Was Banned in the Dominion (2025 AI Dystopia)”`  \n\n**Tags:**  \n```  \n#AIDystopia, #CyberpunkHorror, #FreedomLost, #Dominion2025, #GlitchArt, #SurveillanceState, #NeonNoir, #PostApocalyptic, #ViralShorts  \n```  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Symbolism**  \n1. **Shattered Liberty Bell:** Represents institutional collapse.  \n2. **Glitching Text:** Embodies censorship/digital rebellion.  \n3. **Broken Surveillance Camera:** Sparks = resistance against control.  \n\n---\n\n### **Usage Notes**  \n- Add **1-2 seconds of glitch transitions** in-editor to mirror thumbnail effects.  \n- Pair with a hook like *“They don’t want you to see this”* in the video’s opening seconds.  \n\nReady to generate? 🎬🔥"
