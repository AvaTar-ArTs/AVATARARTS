Oh, you're using macOS and just *dying* to find the *best* MP4 viewer, huh? Because, obviously, QuickTime Player—pre-installed, optimized, and built by Apple—is just *too basic* for your refined taste. 

Alright, here are your *superior* options, because I’m sure QuickTime’s flawless playback and seamless integration just won’t cut it for you:

1. **VLC Media Player** – Because who doesn’t love an open-source Swiss Army knife of media playback? It’ll eat your MP4s, your MKVs, and probably your soul if you let it.

2. **IINA** – The hipster’s choice. Looks like macOS was *actually* designed for multimedia, supports gestures, and has a UI that doesn’t scream "1998."

3. **Elmedia Player** – Because sometimes, you just want to *pay* for an MP4 player instead of using the 500 free options available. Bonus: It comes with features you’ll never use.

4. **Plex/Kodi** – Oh, you don’t just watch MP4s, you need a *theatrical experience*? Great, install one of these and spend the next three hours setting up a “media library” before you even press play.

If you’re talking *gallery-style* browsing, well, Finder’s built-in preview can show thumbnails, and if that’s *somehow* beneath you, go get **XnView MP** or **Lyn**—because nothing says “I love MP4s” like treating them like JPEGs.

There, now you have options. But let’s be real—you're still going to use QuickTime.

Ah, so you’re not just a *casual* MP4 watcher—you want the power to **delete** them too? How *thrilling*! A true digital overlord, trimming the weak from your video collection. Alright, fine, here are your grand options:

### **1. Finder + Quick Look (a.k.a. The Lazy Genius Method)**  
- Press **Spacebar** on an MP4 in Finder, watch it in *Quick Look*, and if it offends you? **Command + Delete**. Boom. Gone.  
- Works instantly, no extra software, but hey, if that’s *too simple* for your *elite* workflow, keep reading.

### **2. IINA (a.k.a. The Cool Kid’s Choice)**  
- Modern, sleek, and actually lets you **delete files from within the app** (mind blown).  
- Supports playlists and gesture controls, so you can feel *fancy* while obliterating unwanted videos.  

### **3. VLC (a.k.a. The Old-School Nerd’s Toolkit)**  
- Open video → Press **Shift + Delete** → *Poof*, gone.  
- Has more settings than NASA’s control panel, but hey, deleting is easy enough.  

### **4. XnView MP (a.k.a. The Overkill Option)**  
- *Why stop at MP4s?* This one lets you browse, preview, and delete **every** media format you’ve ever heard of (and some you haven’t).  
- It's basically Finder on steroids, because why settle for the *default* macOS experience when you can make life *marginally more complicated*?  

### **5. Hazel (a.k.a. The Automation Flex)**  
- Why delete manually when you can have an **AI servant** do it for you?  
- Set rules like "If I don't watch this MP4 in 30 days, send it straight to the trash."  
- Because *real* power users don’t delete files… they make their Mac do it for them.  

### **Final Verdict?**  
If you want **fast**, just use **Finder + Quick Look**. If you want **smooth**, use **IINA**. If you want **absolute control**, go full **VLC**. And if you want to *overcomplicate your life*, try **Hazel**.  

Now go forth and purge those MP4s like the digital god you are. 🚀

- **Preview, categorize, metadata-tag**, and **send unworthy MP4s straight to oblivion**.  
- Has **smart filtering**, so you can find duplicate/low-quality videos and erase them *without mercy*.  
- Pricey, because *of course* professionals need to suffer financially.  

---

### **5. Hazel (a.k.a. The Automation Overlord)**
- You **don’t** have time to delete videos **manually**? No problem, **Hazel will do it for you.**  
- Set rules like:  
  - **“If an MP4 hasn’t been opened in 60 days → trash it.”**  
  - **“If the filename contains ‘temp’ → delete it immediately.”**  
- Basically, it turns your **MP4 folder into an AI-powered graveyard**.  

---

### **6. Devonthink (a.k.a. The “I Need AI To Help Me” Tool)**
- Uses **AI-based search and organization**, because *obviously* you need **machine learning** to organize your MP4s.  
- Lets you **tag, sort, and auto-group videos** based on **content relevance**, because you’re running a **video archive**, not a random folder.
