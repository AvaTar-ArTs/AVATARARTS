## Quick Actions

### 1. Review Security Issues (IMPORTANT!)
```bash
# 118 items contained potential secrets and were excluded
# Review what was detected:
grep -i "secret\|password\|key" /Users/steven/Documents/paste_export/analysis_log.txt
```

**Action Required:** Rotate any exposed credentials!

### 2. Explore Your Most Common Commands
```bash
# See your Git workflow
cat commands/git/items.txt | head -50

# See Python commands
cat commands/python/items.txt | head -50
```

```bash
# Open the URLs file
open urls/items.txt
```

- github.com (187 references)
- avatararts.org (154 references)
- docs.python.org (104 references)

### 4. Review Code Snippets
```bash
# Python snippets
open code/python/items.txt

# SQL queries
open code/sql/items.txt
```

### 5. Search Everything
```bash
cd /Users/steven/Documents/paste_export/organized

# Search for specific term
grep -r "django" . --include="*.txt"

# Find all items from a specific date
grep -r "2025-10-26" . --include="*.txt"
```
