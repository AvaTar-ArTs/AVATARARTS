### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily used for processing structured grid data like images. They were invented by Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner in 1989. CNNs have revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling advancements in areas such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

#### Architecture

A typical CNN architecture consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

- **Convolutional Layers:** These layers apply a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input data. Each filter convolves across the input data, producing a feature map that detects specific features such as edges, textures, and patterns. The parameters of these filters are learned during training.

- **Pooling Layers:** Also known as subsampling or downsampling layers, pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. The most common type is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from each region of the feature map, thereby reducing its size and computation requirements while retaining important features.

- **Fully Connected Layers:** After several convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and fed into one or more fully connected layers, which perform the final classification or regression task. These layers resemble those in traditional neural networks, connecting every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next.

#### Training

CNNs are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent. During training, the network learns the optimal filter values that minimize the loss function, typically a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual labels. The training process involves adjusting the weights of the filters and the fully connected layers through iterative updates.

#### Applications

CNNs have become the cornerstone of many state-of-the-art systems in computer vision. Some notable applications include:

- **Image Classification:** CNNs can classify images into various categories with high accuracy. They have been used in systems like Google Photos and Facebook's automatic tagging.

- **Object Detection:** CNNs can detect and localize objects within an image, which is essential for tasks like autonomous driving and facial recognition.

- **Medical Image Analysis:** CNNs assist in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.

- **Image Segmentation:** CNNs are used to partition an image into meaningful segments, useful in applications such as scene understanding and medical image analysis.

Overall, CNNs have significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in tasks that involve visual data, and continue to be an area of active research and development. The pioneering work of LeCun and his colleagues laid the foundation for these transformative technologies, which have since become integral to modern computer vision systems.
