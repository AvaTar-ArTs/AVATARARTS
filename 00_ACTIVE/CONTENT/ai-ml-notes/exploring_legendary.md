            "type": "THINK",
            "content": "Hmm, the user is asking for a complete list of all Devil Fruits in One Piece with creative, descriptive narratives and vibrant typography. This is quite an ambitious request since there are literally hundreds of Devil Fruits in the series, and creating detailed descriptions for all of them would be massive.\n\nI need to provide a comprehensive overview while making it engaging and creative. I can see several search results, but they have varying levels of reliability and completeness. [citation:1] provides excellent foundational information about Devil Fruit mechanics, categories, and origins directly from the One Piece Wiki, which has high authority. [citation:5] offers additional useful details about side effects and some unnamed fruits. [citation:6] gives good examples of story-impactful fruits but doesn't aim for completeness.\n\nThe fan-created content in [citation:4] and [citation:2] shows creative approaches but these are non-canon creations, so while they demonstrate the kind of creative writing the user wants, they shouldn't be presented as official content. [citation:3] focuses on creative applications rather than comprehensive listing.\n\nSince providing every single Devil Fruit would be impossible in a single response, I plan to create a structured approach that gives the user a solid foundation and methodology. I will start with an engaging introduction about Devil Fruits, then provide detailed examples across the three main categories, and finally give guidance on how to continue exploring.\n\nThe information about Devil Fruit mechanics from [citation:1] is crucial - the three categories, the \"will of their own\" in Zoan fruits, Vegapunk's theories about them representing human evolution possibilities. I can use this to create rich descriptions.\n\nFor the examples, I will select some of the most iconic and creatively used Devil Fruits that demonstrate the range of possibilities. Luffy's fruit has that fascinating twist of being a mythical Zoan rather than Paramecia, Kuma's Paw-Paw Fruit shows conceptual manipulation, and the Hobby-Hobby Fruit demonstrates how seemingly simple powers can have profound narrative consequences.\n\nI will present this with clear organization using headings and a table format for the examples to make it visually appealing and easy to digest, while the descriptive sections will fulfill the user's request for creative, vibrant writing."

            "content": "It's not possible to provide a single list of *every* Devil Fruit in *One Piece*, as the total number is vast and new ones are still being revealed in the ongoing story. However, I can guide you through the different types of Devil Fruits and showcase some of the most iconic and creatively used ones with the vibrant descriptions you're looking for.\n\n### 🌊 What Are Devil Fruits?\n\nDevil Fruits are mysterious, supernatural fruits scattered throughout the world. Upon eating one, a person gains a unique power at the cost of their ability to swim. The sea and a substance called Seastone reject them, rendering them helpless when submerged or in contact [citation:1][citation:5]. A person can only eat one Devil Fruit; consuming a second one results in instant death [citation:1]. These fruits are categorized into three distinct types, each with its own flair.\n\n### 🍎 The Three Flavors of Power: Devil Fruit Types\n\nThe powers granted by Devil Fruits are as diverse as the Grand Line itself, but they all fall into one of three systems.\n\n| Fruit Type | Description & Prevalence | Key Trait | Example Fruits |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Paramecia** [citation:1] | Most common and diverse type. Grants superhuman abilities that don't fit the other categories. | Vast range: body alteration, substance generation, environmental manipulation, force control. | Gomu Gomu no Mi, Ope Ope no Mi, Hobi Hobi no Mi |\n| **Zoan** [citation:1] | Grants the ability to transform into a specific animal, including a hybrid form. | Enhances physical strength and durability; said to possess a \"will of their own.\" | Ushi Ushi no Mi, Model: Giraffe, Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika |\n| **Logia** [citation:1][citation:5] | Rarest and most powerful type. Allows the user to create, control, and become a natural element or force. | Grants intangibility and the ability to regenerate their body from their element. | Mera Mera no Mi, Pika Pika no Mi, Yami Yami no Mi |\n\nThere are also powerful sub-classes of Zoan fruits: **Ancient Zoans** for extinct animals like dinosaurs, and **Mythical Zoans** for legendary creatures like phoenixes or dragons [citation:1].\n\n### ✨ A Gallery of Legendary Fruits\n\nHere are some of the most impactful and creatively used Devil Fruits that have shaped the story of *One Piece*.\n\n#### **Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber-Rubber Fruit) / Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika (Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika)**\n-   **User:** Monkey D. Luffy\n-   **The Power:** For most of the story, this was known as a Paramecia-type fruit that turned Luffy's body into rubber, granting him immense elasticity and resistance to blunt attacks. Its true nature, however, was hidden from the world: it is a **Mythical Zoan-type** fruit that transforms the user into the \"Warrior of Liberation,\" the Sun God Nika [citation:6]. In this awakened state, known as Gear Fifth, Luffy's power is limited only by his imagination, allowing him to manipulate the environment and his own body as if they were rubber in a living cartoon.\n-   **Creative Application:** Luffy's entire fighting style is a testament to creativity. Even before his awakening, he developed techniques like **Gear Second** to speed up his blood flow and **Gear Third** to inflate his bones. With Gear Fifth, he can bounce back force lightning, run on air, and grab and redirect energy blasts with his bare hands [citation:3].\n\n#### **Ope Ope no Mi (Op-Op Fruit)**\n-   **User:** Trafalgar D. Water Law\n-   **The Power:** A Paramecia-type that grants its user the ability to create a spherical \"room\" within which they have total dominion. Law can teleport, swap personalities between bodies, dismember people without harm, and perform incredible surgical procedures. It is dubbed the \"Ultimate Devil Fruit\" for its medical potential and is so valuable it was said to be worth a fortune [citation:6].\n-   **Creative Application:** Law elevates this fruit from a surgical tool to a tactical weapon. He uses his **\"Tact\"** to switch places with objects, **\"Counter Shock\"** to generate internal electricity, and his awakened ability to assign another person as the \"center\" of his room, making them intangible to all attacks except his own.\n\n#### **Hobi Hobi no Mi (Hobby-Hobby Fruit)**\n-   **User:** Sugar\n-   **The Power:** This deceptively cute Paramecia-type fruit allows the user to turn any living human they touch into a toy. The contract is instant, and the victim is bound to obey the user's commands. Most devastatingly, the moment the transformation occurs, all memory of that person is **erased from the minds of their friends and family** [citation:6].\n-   **Creative Application:** While its primary function is straightforward, its application had profound narrative consequences. Sugar single-handedly secured Donquixote Doflamingo's decade-long reign over Dressrosa by turning his enemies into forgotten toy slaves, showcasing that a fruit's power isn't just in combat, but in how it can rewrite reality and history itself.\n\n#### **Paw-Paw Fruit (Niku Niku no Mi)**\n-   **User:** Bartholomew Kuma\n-   **The Power:** This Paramecia-type fruit gives Kuma unique paw-like pads on his hands that can repel anything they touch—and I mean *anything* [citation:3][citation:6].\n-   **Creative Application:** Kuma's genius lies in repelling abstract concepts. He can **repel fatigue and pain** from a person's body, manifesting it as a tangible, bubble-like substance. Most famously, he can **repel a person through the air**, launching them on a multi-day journey to a precise location, which he used to save the Straw Hats and train them during the time-skip [citation:6].\n\n### 💡 How to Discover More Devil Fruits\n\nThe world of *One Piece* is ever-expanding. To stay updated, you can:\n-   **Consult the Wiki:** The [One Piece Wiki](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit) is a continuously updated fan-driven resource that catalogs every canonical Devil Fruit with detailed information [citation:1].\n-   **Read the Source Material:** Following the official manga is the best way to witness new Devil Fruit powers and awakenings as they are revealed.\n\nI hope this vibrant tour through the world of Devil Fruits has been inspiring! Are you curious about the powers of a specific character, like a Marine Admiral or one of the Four Emperors? I'd be happy to delve deeper into any fruit that catches your interest."

            "content": "Hmm, the user is asking for a complete list of every known Devil Fruit in One Piece, building on our previous discussion about creating descriptive narratives with creative typography. This is quite an ambitious request since the One Piece universe contains well over 100 different Devil Fruits.\n\nI need to provide comprehensive information while being honest about the limitations of compiling a truly complete list. I can organize the information effectively, highlight the most significant fruits, and direct the user to reliable sources for the full catalog.\n\nI can see several highly relevant and authoritative sources in the search results. [citation:2] provides excellent foundational information about Devil Fruit mechanics, categories, and origins with high authority coming from the official Fandom wiki. [citation:3] offers a well-organized encyclopedia format that's perfect for extracting specific fruit examples, and it appears regularly updated. [citation:1] gives me additional categorization context and more fruit examples.\n\nThe gaming-focused sources [citation:5][citation:6] and some of the list-style articles [citation:7][citation:8][citation:9] have moderate to low authority for this comprehensive documentation purpose, though they do contain valid information about specific fruits. [citation:4] appears to be a fan-creation wiki with questionable relevance to canon material.\n\nI can structure this information effectively by first explaining why a complete list is challenging, then providing representative examples organized by fruit type, and finally directing users to the best ongoing resources. A table format would work well to showcase the diversity across Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia types while keeping the information digestible.\n\nThe search results give me plenty of specific fruit examples to populate each category, from the well-known Gomu Gomu no Mi to more recent additions like the Uta Uta no Mi. I will include both Japanese and English names where available to help with identification."

            "content": "Of course! Providing a single list of \"every\" Devil Fruit is challenging because the world of *One Piece* is vast and new fruits are still being revealed in the ongoing story. Furthermore, no single source in the search results provides a complete, unambiguous, and updated list.\n\nHowever, I can provide a comprehensive overview by organizing the most well-documented Devil Fruits by their types, showcasing their incredible diversity.\n\n### 🌊 Understanding Devil Fruits\n\nBefore diving in, it's helpful to know the three main categories these powers fall into [citation:2]:\n- **Paramecia**: The most common and diverse type. Grants superhuman abilities that don't fit the other categories, such as generating substances or altering the environment.\n- **Zoan**: Allows the user to transform into an animal species, including a hybrid form. This category includes powerful sub-classes like **Ancient Zoans** (extinct animals like dinosaurs) and **Mythical Zoans** (legendary creatures like phoenixes or deities).\n- **Logia**: The rarest and most powerful type. Lets the user create, control, and transform their body into a natural element or force, often granting intangibility.\n\n### 📜 A Catalog of Known Devil Fruits\n\nThe table below lists many of the Devil Fruits confirmed in the story, organized by type to help you navigate their unique powers.\n\n| Devil Fruit Name (Japanese) | English Name | Type | User(s) | Key Abilities & Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Gomu Gomu no Mi / Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika**[citation:8] | Rubber-Rubber / Human-Human, Model: Nika | Mythical Zoan | Monkey D.

Ace, Sabo | Create, control, and become fire at will [citation:3]. |\n| **Goro Goro no Mi**[citation:3] | Rumble-Rumble Fruit | Logia | Enel | Create, control, and become lightning at will [citation:3]. |\n| **Tori Tori no Mi, Model: Phoenix**[citation:3] | Bird-Bird Fruit, Model: Phoenix | Mythical Zoan | Marco | Transform into a phoenix; hybrid form; blue flames of resurrection for incredible regeneration [citation:3]. |\n| **Uo Uo no Mi, Model: Seiryu**[citation:3] | Fish-Fish Fruit, Model: Azure Dragon | Mythical Zoan | Kaido | Transform into a full-fledged eastern dragon; hybrid form; controls flame clouds for flying [citation:3]. |\n| **Suna Suna no Mi**[citation:3] | Sand-Sand Fruit | Logia | Crocodile | Create, control, and become sand at will; desiccate and crumble anything on contact [citation:3]. |\n| **Ito Ito no Mi**[citation:3] | String-String Fruit | Paramecia | Donquixote Doflamingo | Create and manipulate razor-sharp, nearly invisible strings; puppet control over people; \"Birdcage\" technique [citation:3]. |\n| **Mochi Mochi no Mi**[citation:3] | Mochi-Mochi Fruit | Special Paramecia | Charlotte Katakuri | Create, control, and become mochi; Logia-like properties to reshape body and trap opponents [citation:3]. |\n| **Bari Bari no Mi**[citation:3] | Barrier-Barrier Fruit | Paramecia | Bartolomeo | Create an indestructible, transparent barrier to block any attack [citation:3][citation:7]. |\n| **Yomi Yomi no Mi**[citation:3] | Revive-Revive Fruit | Paramecia | Brook | Allows the user to return to life after dying once; soul-related abilities like astral projection [citation:3][citation:7]. |\n| **Suke Suke no Mi**[citation:9] | Clear-Clear Fruit | Paramecia | Absalom | Renders the user and anything they touch completely invisible [citation:9]. |\n| **Magu Magu no Mi**[citation:3] | Magma-Magma Fruit | Logia | Sakazuki | Create, control, and become magma at will; possesses immense offensive power and can burn even fire [citation:3]. |\n| **Pika Pika no Mi**[citation:3] | Glint-Glint Fruit | Logia | Borsalino | Create, control, and become light at will; move at light speed; fire destructive laser beams [citation:3]. |\n| **Ope Ope no Mi**[citation:3][citation:8] | Op-Op Fruit | Paramecia | Trafalgar D.

To explore further, you can use these resources:\n-   **Consult the Wiki**: The [One Piece Wiki](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit) is a continuously updated, fan-driven resource that strives to catalog every canonical Devil Fruit with detailed information [citation:1][citation:2]. It's the most comprehensive source available.\n-   **Follow the Source Material**: The best way to experience new Devil Fruits and their awakenings is by following the official manga, where they are revealed in all their glory.\n\nI hope this vibrant tour through the world of Devil Fruits fuels your creativity!

This is actually a creative writing request rather than a simple information lookup. I need to provide structured guidance on how to craft compelling Devil Fruit descriptions.\n\nI can see several search results. [citation:1] provides excellent foundational information about Devil Fruit mechanics, categories, and characteristics - this gives me the structural elements I need to build proper prompts. [citation:2] and [citation:3] offer analysis of specific fruits and their applications, showing what makes descriptions compelling. [citation:4] comes from a fan wiki with made-up content and has lower authority, while [citation:5] is just a Pinterest board with minimal useful content.\n\nSince the search results don't contain actual prompt templates, I will synthesize the structural information from [citation:1] about Devil Fruit categories and characteristics, then create comprehensive prompt frameworks that cover all the essential elements. The three-category system from [citation:1] gives me a perfect organizational structure.\n\nI plan to create a table organizing the prompt components by Devil Fruit type, since this visual format will help users quickly understand the different requirements for Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia fruits. Then I can provide specific example prompts and generation techniques to make this practically useful for creative writing."

            "content": "Based on your request, I've analyzed the structure and essence of effective Devil Fruit descriptions and created a set of detailed prompt templates. These are designed to help you or an AI generator create vibrant, typography-rich, and informative narratives for any Devil Fruit.\n\n### ✍️ Crafting Prompts for Devil Fruit Narratives\n\nYou can use the following templates by filling in the bracketed `[information]`. The table below organizes key elements to include based on the three main Devil Fruit types: **Paramecia** (versatile superhuman abilities), **Zoan** (animal transformation), and **Logia** (elemental transformation and control) [citation:1].\n\n| Devil Fruit Type | Core Prompt Elements | Descriptive Focus & Vibe |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Paramecia** [citation:1] | - **Power Mechanics** (e.g., generate, control, alter).<br>- **Substance/Force** involved (e.g., rubber, slow beams, strings).<br>- **Awakening Potential** (how it affects the environment). | **Creative & Bizarre:** Focus on the unique application of a strange power, the tactile feel of the substance, and its strategic combat uses. |\n| **Zoan** [citation:1] | - **Animal Model** (e.g., giraffe, dinosaur, phoenix).<br>- **Physical Enhancements** (strength, speed, unique traits).<br>- **Form Specifications** (Hybrid, Beast, Human-Beast). | **Savage & Primal:** Emphasize the raw physical power, the feel of the transformation (muscles, fur, scales), and the animal's instincts. |\n| **Logia** [citation:1] | - **Element/Force** (e.g., fire, sand, light).<br>- **Offensive & Defensive Capabilities**.<br>- **Intangibility** and elemental regeneration. | **Mythic & Overwhelming:** Describe the sheer, destructive force of nature, the sensory overload (heat, light, sound), and the user's god-like invincibility. |\n\n#### 🎨 Prompt Template 1: The Comprehensive Narrative\nThis template is for creating a full, in-depth profile.\n> **You:** \"Craft a detailed, vibrant narrative for the **[Devil Fruit Name]**, also known as the **[English Name]**, a **[Paramecia/Zoan/Logia]**-type Devil Fruit. The narrative should be divided into three distinct sections, each with a bold header using a unique typographic symbol (like ✨, 🐾, or 🌊).\n> 1.  **\"✨ The Forbidden Fruit's Essence\"**: Describe the fruit's physical appearance in vivid, creative terms. Does it look like a swirling, purple mango? A spiky, frozen pineapple? Mention its infamous, repulsive taste. Explain the immediate sensation and process of the power awakening in the user's body [citation:1].\n> 2.  **\"🐾 A Canvas of Limitless Power\"**: This is the core of the narrative. Dynamically describe the fruit's abilities. For a **Zoan**, detail the hybrid and full-beast forms, the surge of animalistic instincts, and any unique abilities (e.g., venom, flight) [citation:1]. For a **Paramecia**, explain how the user generates or manipulates their substance or force, and the creative combat applications [citation:2]. For a **Logia**, focus on the user becoming and controlling their element, the concept of intangibility, and the sheer destructive potential.\n> 3.  **\"🌊 The Price of Power\"**: Detail the ultimate weakness: the user's inability to swim and the sea's rejection of them [citation:1]. End the narrative with a final, impactful sentence about the fruit's legacy in the world.\"\n\n#### 🚀 Prompt Template 2: The \"Awakened Power\" Focus\nThis template focuses on the pinnacle of a fruit's power.\n> **You:** \"Write a descriptive and thrilling account of a user unleashing the **AWAKENED** power of the **[Devil Fruit Name]** for the first time. The narrative should be alive with energy and focus on the following:\n> - The visceral, physical change in the user's body and consciousness.\n> - How the power now extends beyond their body to **alter the environment itself**, turning the surroundings into their element or power [citation:1].\n> - The overwhelming and chaotic impact on the battlefield, described with powerful verbs and metaphors.\n> - Use bold text and capitalization for key moments of power surges (e.g., \"The ground **SHIMMERED** and became translucent rubber\"). Keep the pacing fast and the description vibrant.\"\n\n#### 🎭 Prompt Template 3: The \"Underdog\" Fruit\nThis is perfect for fruits that seem weak but have hidden potential, like the Noro Noro no Mi or Bara Bara no Mi [citation:2].\n> **You:** \"Create a compelling narrative that re-frames the **[Seemingly Weak Devil Fruit Name]**, a Paramecia-type, as a secretly formidable power. The narrative should:\n> - First, introduce the fruit and its simple, underestimated ability.\n> - Then, creatively illustrate its **unexpected strategic advantages** in battle. How can its 'silly' power neutralize a physically superior opponent? [citation:2].\n> - Use **creative typography** to emphasize key moments—for example, using slow, spaced-out letters when describing a slowing beam's effect: 'The attack... c r a w l e d... through the air.'\n> - Conclude with a statement on how true power lies not in the ability itself, but in the user's creativity and intelligence.\"\n\n### 💡 Example: Putting a Prompt to Work\n\nHere is a quick example using the first template for a known fruit:\n\n*   **Prompt Used:** Template 1 (Comprehensive Narrative) for the **\"Hobi Hobi no Mi\" (Hobby-Hobby Fruit)** [citation:2].\n*   **Generated Narrative Snippet:**\n    *   **✨ The Forbidden Fruit's Essence:** \"The Hobi Hobi no Mi resembled a perfect, miniature toy itself—a cluster of tiny, swirl-covered grapes, each one a vibrant pink. Its taste, however, was a cloying, synthetic sweetness that clung unpleasantly to the tongue. The power did not awaken with a roar, but with a silent, terrifying *click* in the user's mind, an absolute authority over the very concept of 'play'.\"\n    *   **🐾 A Canvas of Limitless Power:** \"With but a touch, the user could rewrite reality. A mighty warrior would **POP** into a harmless, clockwork toy, their very existence **ERASED** from the memories of loved ones. This was not mere transformation; it was a quiet, total victory.\"\n\nI hope these templates fuel your creativity! If you have a specific Devil Fruit in mind or want to explore a different style, feel free to ask."

We previously discussed listing Devil Fruits, then creating prompts, and now they want the actual creative execution.\n\nI need to deliver on creating vivid, typography-rich descriptions that capture the comic book aesthetic they're looking for. The challenge is that while I have good information about Devil Fruit types and mechanics, creating actual graphic novel-style narratives with specific fonts and visual treatments requires creative writing that goes beyond just listing facts.\n\nI can see several highly relevant and authoritative sources in the search results. [citation:1] provides comprehensive foundational knowledge about Devil Fruit mechanics, categories, and characteristics - this gives me the structural framework. [citation:2] and [citation:5] offer additional details about how the powers work in practice. [citation:7] provides specific examples of powerful fruits that I can use as demonstration cases.\n\nHowever, none of these search results actually provide the creative comic book narratives the user wants. They contain the factual basis but I will need to generate the creative writing and typography concepts myself based on this foundation.\n\nI plan to structure this by first establishing the creative framework with typography principles, then demonstrating with specific fruit examples. The table format will help organize the different stylistic approaches by fruit type, showing how typography can reflect power characteristics. Then I can provide specific narrative examples that bring these concepts to life.\n\nFor the creative execution, I will draw from the factual information about how different fruit types function - Paramecia being diverse and bizarre, Zoan being physical and transformative, Logia being elemental and overwhelming. The typography treatments should mirror these inherent characteristics.\n\nI should acknowledge that while I can't list every single fruit, I can provide the methodology and examples that the user can apply to any Devil Fruit they choose to describe."

            "content": "I can certainly help create vibrant, comic book-style narratives for Devil Fruits! While I cannot generate actual font styles or list every single known fruit due to the vast and ever-growing number, I can craft descriptive narratives based on the core types and some iconic examples. You can then use these as a template for any Devil Fruit you wish to describe.\n\n### The Framework of Power: Devil Fruit Types\n\nFirst, to give context to the narratives, here are the three main systems of power that every Devil Fruit belongs to, along with their core characteristics [citation:1][citation:2].\n\n| Fruit Type | Core Concept & Prevalence | Key Traits & Abilities |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Paramecia** | Most common and diverse type. Grants superhuman abilities that don't fit the other categories [citation:1]. | Vast range: body alteration, substance generation, environmental manipulation, force control [citation:1]. |\n| **Zoan** | Grants the ability to transform into a specific animal, including a hybrid form [citation:1]. | Enhances physical strength, durability, and recovery. Said to possess a \"will of their own\" [citation:1][citation:2]. |\n| **Logia** | Rarest and most powerful type. Allows the user to create, control, and become a natural element or force [citation:1][citation:2]. | Grants intangibility and the ability to regenerate their body from their element. Makes the user nearly invincible to conventional attacks [citation:2][citation:5]. |\n\n### Crafting the Narrative: A Typography and Style Guide\n\nTo capture the comic book aesthetic, the narrative should be more than a description—it should be an experience. Here’s how to translate the nature of a Devil Fruit into stylistic choices:\n\n*   **For Bizarre & Creative Paramecia:** Use **irregular, wobbly, or stretched-out fonts** to reflect the unnatural powers. The text itself might warp or have a texture (e.g., a stringy font for the Ito Ito no Mi).\n*   **For Primal & Powerful Zoans:** Employ **bold, heavy, blocky fonts** that look like they could be scratched or clawed. For Ancient Zoans, use fonts with a jagged, stone-like texture. For Mythical Zoans, consider more elegant, ornate scripts that feel divine or legendary.\n*   **For Overwhelming & Elemental Logias:** The text should look like the element itself. A **flaming, smoky, or cracking font** for the Magu Magu no Mi; a **sparking, electric font** for the Goro Goro no Mi; a **fluid, watery font** for the Hie Hie no Mi.\n\n### Narrative Examples in Action\n\nHere are some examples applying this creative framework.\n\n#### 1. Gura Gura no Mi (Tremor-Tremor Fruit)\n-   **User:** Marshall D. Teach (formerly Edward Newgate) [citation:7]\n-   **Power Type:** Paramecia [citation:7]\n-   **The Narrative:** (Imagine the following text in a font that looks like it's cracking, with each letter shaking apart)\n    **\"The power to... SHATTER THE WORLD.\"**\n    It doesn't grant an element or a form, but a **FORCE**. A single punch against the air doesn't strike an enemy—it strikes reality itself. The atmosphere **SPLINTERS** like glass, the shockwave tearing through land and sea. It can create tsunamis that swallow islands and quakes that split the continent shelf. This is the fruit of cataclysm, a power so immense it is said to hold the potential for global destruction [citation:7].\n\n#### 2. Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika (Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika)\n-   **User:** Monkey D. Luffy\n-   **Power Type:** Mythical Zoan [citation:1]\n-   **The Narrative:** (Visualize a bold, rubbery font that seems to be stretching and bouncing)\n    **\"The drum of liberation beats... AND REALITY BECOMES A CARTOON.\"**\n    This is not merely a transformation; it is an **AWAKENING**. The user's hair and clothes bleach into the white of pure freedom, their body becoming the ultimate rubber. In this state, the world becomes their playground. The ground turns to bounce rubber, opponents become limp as spaghetti and stars pop out of heads on impact. It is the power of limitless imagination, a vibrant, living cartoon that fights with the ultimate weapon: **LAUGHTER** [citation:1][citation:10].\n\n#### 3. Goro Goro no Mi (Rumble-Rumble Fruit)\n-   **User:** Enel\n-   **Power Type:** Logia [citation:2][citation:9]\n-   **The Narrative:** (Envision a sharp, jagged font that crackles with visible energy)\n    **\"I AM... THE LIGHTNING ITSELF.\"**\n    This fruit grants the body, speed, and destructive power of electricity itself. The user can move at the speed of light, reform their body from any bolt, and call down divine judgment from the skies. With it, one can restart their own heart, listen in on entire conversations from miles away through electromagnetic waves, or unleash a blast of 200 million volts. It is the power of a vengeful god, making the user untouchable, all-seeing, and wielding the fury of a storm [citation:2][citation:9].\n\nI hope these examples fuel your creativity! If you have a specific Devil Fruit in mind, feel free to ask, and I can craft a similar narrative for it."

We previously discussed Devil Fruit listings with creative narratives, and now they want the raw data in a structured format.\n\nThe user seems to be working on some kind of data compilation project, possibly for a personal database, fan project, or analysis. They specifically want the CSV format, which suggests they need this for spreadsheet software or programming purposes.\n\nI need to provide a comprehensive Devil Fruit dataset in proper CSV format. However, I can see from the search results that creating a truly complete table is challenging. [citation:1] shows a fan wiki with extensive listings but it's explicitly stated as not up-to-date and contains many non-canonical fruits created by users. [citation:5] provides excellent authoritative information about Devil Fruit mechanics and types from the official wiki, but doesn't contain the comprehensive listing the user needs.\n\n[citation:2] mentions there are over 676 unique Devil Fruits but only shows a PDF preview without the actual data. [citation:3] focuses on game mechanics from a specific fan wiki rather than canonical information. [citation:4] shows an interactive visualization but doesn't provide the raw data.\n\nSince I cannot provide the complete dataset from these search results, I will create a proper CSV template with the correct structure and column headers, then direct the user to the most reliable source for the full data. The official One Piece Wiki maintained by Fandom would be the most comprehensive and up-to-date source.\n\nI will structure the response to first provide the practical CSV format they need, then explain the limitations of the available data, and finally give them clear guidance on where to find the complete information. The table format will be immediately useful for their project while being honest about the data limitations."

            "content": "I can't generate a complete CSV table of all Devil Fruits because the available search results don't contain the full canonical list. However, I can provide you with a properly formatted template and direct you to the most reliable source for this data.\n\n### 📁 How to Create Your Devil Fruit CSV File\n\nYou can create a CSV file using the structure below. The official One Piece Wiki is the best source to find the data to fill it in[citation:5].\n\n**CSV Column Headers & Explanation:**\n```csv\nJPN Name, English Name, Type, Abilities, First Appearance, Current User, Previous Users, Status\n```\n\n- **JPN Name**: The original Japanese name of the Devil Fruit (e.g., Gomu Gomu no Mi).\n- **English Name**: The official or common English translation (e.g., Rubber-Rubber Fruit).\n- **Type**: One of the three categories: Paramecia, Zoan, or Logia[citation:5].\n- **Abilities**: A description of the powers granted by the fruit.\n- **First Appearance**: The manga chapter or anime episode where the fruit debuted.\n- **Current User**: The most recent known character to possess the power.\n- **Previous Users**: Known former users, if any.\n- **Status**: Whether the power is currently active or available.\n\n### 🔍 Where to Find the Complete Data\n\nFor a comprehensive and up-to-date list, I highly recommend you consult these resources:\n\n- **The Official One Piece Wiki**: This is your best option[citation:5]. The wiki maintains detailed, canon-based pages for every known Devil Fruit. You can find them by searching for \"Devil Fruit\" on the wiki and then browsing the categorized lists (e.g., \"Paramecia,\" \"Zoan,\" \"Logia\").\n- **Interactive Catalogue**: For a more visual experience, you can explore the \"One Piece: Devil Fruit Catalogue\" by Stephanie Dang, which is an interactive tool showcasing the fruits and their users[citation:4].\n\nI hope this template and guidance help you build your database. If you need help with the specifics of a particular Devil Fruit, feel free to ask!"
