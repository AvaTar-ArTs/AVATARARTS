Design a striking typography cover image with the text ‘Elon Musk: Social Security Scandals & Legal Battles’ prominently displayed. The typography should exude a modern, tech-inspired aesthetic, featuring sleek, futuristic fonts intertwined with subtle elements like circuit patterns and legal motifs (e.g., gavel, scales of justice). Incorporate a color scheme of deep blues and metallic silvers to convey professionalism and gravity. The background should be a dark gradient with faint imagery of Social Security cards and legal documents, symbolizing the intertwining themes of technology and legal scrutiny. Ensure the composition balances the boldness of the text with the subtlety of the background elements, creating an image that is both engaging and informative.”



Design Tips:

• Typography: Choose a font that reflects a tech-savvy and authoritative tone. Consider using a sans-serif typeface with clean lines and a slight futuristic flair.

• Color Palette: Deep blues and metallic silvers can evoke a sense of trust and modernity. Use gradients to add depth and dimension to the background.

• Imagery: Subtly integrate elements like circuit patterns to represent technology, and legal symbols such as a gavel or scales to signify the legal challenges. Ensure these elements are understated so as not to overpower the typography.

• Composition: Center the text prominently, with background elements providing context without distraction. Use layering effects to create a sense of depth.
