# Analyzing macOS Startup Processes (Launchctl List)

## Introduction  
The `launchctl list` output shows all **launchd** jobs running in your user login session – including macOS system agents and third-party background services that start at login. We will analyze this list to identify which startup processes are **critical** (essential to the system), which are **optional** (can be delayed at login), and which are **removable** (safe to disable or delete if not needed). The goal is to streamline your Mac’s startup by pausing or removing non-essential launch agents, especially third-party apps like Adobe Creative Cloud, Setapp agents, Google Drive, BetterTouchTool, Bartender, Alfred, Raycast, etc.

Advanced users can modify or disable these launch agents via their property list (plist) files or using `launchctl`. However, it’s important to understand each process’s role before changing it. Below, we classify each relevant process from your `launchctl list` and recommend actions (delay, disable, or keep). We also discuss methods to **delay startup** for non-essential items, such as using “delay start” utilities or editing launchd plists.

## Summary of Safe Actions  
- **Disable or Delay Third-Party Launch Agents:** Most third-party login items (Adobe CC, Google Drive, Setapp, BetterTouchTool, Bartender, Alfred, Raycast, etc.) are **optional**. Disable their “launch at login” setting or remove their launch agent plist to prevent auto-start. You can launch them manually when needed, or use a delayed startup method to run them a bit later. This reduces immediate load on login  [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality).  
- **Delay Non-Essential Services:** Consider delaying startup of heavy background apps (e.g. Adobe sync, Google Drive) using tools like **Delay Start** or **DelayedLauncher**, or an Automator script with a `Pause`. These allow staggering app launches instead of all at once [How to Stop Mac Apps From Launching at Startup | PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/stop-mac-apps-from-launching-at-startup#:~:text=5,Software) [Delay Items in User Login - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7755335#:~:text=Nov%2020%2C%202016%2011%3A03%20AM,in%20response%20to%20chapelroad).  
- **Disable Unused macOS Agents:** macOS starts many user agents for features you may not use (iCloud syncing, Siri, Game Center, etc.). It is typically safe to disable agents like **cloudphotod** (iCloud Photos), **photoanalysisd** (Photos analysis), **gamed** (Game Center), **assistantd** (Siri), **homed** (HomeKit), **newsd** (Apple News), etc., *if* you don’t use those services [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27) [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27). Disabling them frees resources, though they’ll no longer provide their feature.  
- **Do NOT Disable Critical System Processes:** Leave any core macOS processes intact. Essential macOS login items (preferences sync, notification agents, etc.) should remain enabled to avoid system instability. We will flag these as **Critical** – they may appear in `launchctl list` but are best left alone.  

By carefully disabling or delaying only the optional items, you can improve startup time and reduce background resource usage without compromising core system functionality.

## Third-Party Launch Agents and Login Items (Optional)  
These are non-Apple processes running at login, usually installed by apps. They are **not required** for macOS itself – you can safely prevent them from auto-starting, depending on your needs. In general, disabling their auto-launch will not harm your system; it will only stop the associated app or service from running until you manually start it. Below we identify each third-party agent from the list and provide recommendations:

- **Adobe Creative Cloud** – **Status:** *Optional.* This includes various Adobe launch agents (e.g. `com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud`, **Core Sync**, **CCXProcess**, **CC Library**, **Adobe GC** helpers). They handle Adobe app updates, cloud file sync, and license checks. You can turn off Adobe CC auto-launch in Creative Cloud’s preferences [How do I remove Adobe Creative Cloud from… - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252554423#:~:text=2,to%20launch%20at%20startup%20off) to prevent it from running at login. This is recommended if you don’t need Adobe services constantly – for example, you can update apps manually by launching Creative Cloud when required. In fact, Adobe prefixes all its background plists with `com.adobe*`, making them easy to locate and disable [How to Disable Adobe’s Creative Cloud Background Processes. | by Justin Ross | Medium](https://justin-ross.medium.com/how-to-disable-adobes-creative-cloud-background-processes-fb4e572a628c#:~:text=Library,to%20programmatically%20find%20these%20suckers). Advanced users often unload or move these Adobe plists out of `~/Library/LaunchAgents` and `/Library/LaunchAgents` to stop them from running [How to Disable Adobe’s Creative Cloud Background Processes. | by Justin Ross | Medium](https://justin-ross.medium.com/how-to-disable-adobes-creative-cloud-background-processes-fb4e572a628c#:~:text=Library,to%20programmatically%20find%20these%20suckers). **Recommendation:** Disable at startup. Delay or launch manually only when using Adobe apps. *(Removing Adobe CC auto-start will stop background syncing/updaters but won’t prevent you from using Adobe apps; just remember to run the CC app occasionally for updates [How do I remove Adobe Creative Cloud from… - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252554423#:~:text=2,to%20launch%20at%20startup%20off) [How do I remove Adobe Creative Cloud from… - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252554423#:~:text=2,to%20launch%20at%20startup%20off).)*

- **Setapp Agent & Updater** – **Status:** *Optional.* Setapp (the app subscription service) installs two launch agents (`com.setapp.DesktopClient.SetappAgent` and `...SetappUpdater`) that run at login to manage app licensing and updates [Where does Setapp store its files? – Setapp Support](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002037440-Where-does-Setapp-store-its-files#:~:text=Setapp%20creates%20,apps%20on%20the%20system%20launch). These ensure your Setapp apps stay activated and updated. If you use Setapp apps regularly, you may leave these enabled. However, they are not critical to macOS. **Recommendation:** *Delay or Disable.* You can prevent them from auto-launching to save memory; your Setapp apps will still run, though if the licensing agent is off you might need to open Setapp manually once in a while to validate licenses. Disabling the Setapp updater simply means you’ll check for app updates manually. These can always be re-enabled if needed.

- **Google Drive for Desktop (Google Drive File Stream)** – **Status:** *Optional.* The Drive agent (`com.google.drivefs...`) mounts your Google Drive at login and syncs files. It’s convenient if you constantly use Drive, but it can consume CPU and memory in the background (users have reported high CPU usage) [Google Drive File Stream for macOS - UNC Asheville ITS](https://kb.unca.edu/kb/google-drive-file-stream-for-macos#:~:text=Google%20Drive%20File%20Stream%20for,found%20in%20your%20%2FApplications%20folder). Google Drive is set to auto-start by default [Google Drive File Stream for macOS - UNC Asheville ITS](https://kb.unca.edu/kb/google-drive-file-stream-for-macos#:~:text=Google%20Drive%20File%20Stream%20for,found%20in%20your%20%2FApplications%20folder), but you can turn this off in the app’s Preferences (uncheck “Launch at login” in the Settings gear) [Google drive prompt to disconnect upon startup of the computer](https://support.google.com/drive/thread/179970136/google-drive-prompt-to-disconnect-upon-startup-of-the-computer?hl=en#:~:text=Google%20drive%20prompt%20to%20disconnect,starting%20when%20you%20have). **Recommendation:** *Delay or Disable.* If you only occasionally need Drive, disable its auto-start and launch it manually when required. If you do need it daily, consider delaying its startup by a minute or two after login so it doesn’t choke your boot process. (Using a delay tool or an Automator script with `sleep` before launching the Drive app can help.) 

- **BetterTouchTool (BTT)** – **Status:** *Optional.* BetterTouchTool is a user utility for customizing input (by Andreas Hegenberg). If set to launch at login, you’ll see it in the background (it may appear as `com.hegenberg.BetterTouchTool` or an `application.com.hegenberg...` entry in launchctl). BTT is not required by macOS; only keep it running for its functionality (gesture and window manager tweaks). **Recommendation:** Keep it *enabled* if you rely on its features, but you can choose to delay its launch slightly. BTT itself is lightweight, so delaying might not be necessary unless troubleshooting a conflict. If you rarely use it, disable the “Launch at login” option in BTT preferences and run it only when needed.

- **Bartender** – **Status:** *Optional.* Bartender (by Surtees Studios) manages menu bar icons. It typically auto-starts (either via a LaunchAgent or as a login item) so your menu bar is organized on login. Not needed for the OS – it’s purely a convenience tool. **Recommendation:** *Delay or Enable as needed.* You can disable Bartender at login to save resources; you’ll just get the default macOS menu bar until you manually start Bartender. If you want it always on but not immediately at login, consider a short delay. Bartender is fairly light, so this is more about personal preference in startup order.

- **Alfred** – **Status:** *Optional.* Alfred (by Running with Crayons) is an app launcher/search alternative to Spotlight. It usually runs at login for instant accessibility. It’s not system-critical. **Recommendation:** If Alfred is your primary launcher, you’ll want it running (you can mark it as **Enable** at login). If you only occasionally use Alfred or you also have Raycast, you could disable its auto-start and run it manually (or vice versa with Raycast). There’s little benefit in delaying Alfred since it’s not heavy, but disabling one of the two launchers (Alfred or Raycast) might make sense to avoid redundancy.

- **Raycast** – **Status:** *Optional.* Raycast is another Spotlight/Alfred alternative that may auto-launch. It is also non-essential to the OS. **Recommendation:** Decide between Alfred and Raycast if you have both. Running both at login is unnecessary. You can disable one of them from auto-starting. If using Raycast exclusively, keep it at login (or at least one of these launchers should remain for efficiency). Otherwise, disable Raycast’s auto-launch and only open it when you need it. As with Alfred, delaying it has minimal impact unless you just want fewer apps opening at login.

- **Other Third-Party Agents** – Check for any additional non-Apple labels in your `launchctl list` output (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, Microsoft AutoUpdate `com.microsoft.update.agent`, VPN or helper tools, etc.). These are generally **Removable/Optional** as well. For each, ask if you need it running constantly. For example: a Dropbox launch agent can be disabled if you don’t need continuous file sync (launch Dropbox manually instead), a Microsoft AutoUpdate agent can be run on demand to check for Office updates rather than always running, and so on. The rule of thumb: if it’s not part of macOS and you recognize it as installed software, it can usually be turned off without harming the OS [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality) [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality). Just be aware you lose whatever background functionality it provided until you run it manually.

## Apple System Agents – Critical vs. Optional  
In your startup list, you’ll also see many Apple-provided agents (labels beginning with `com.apple.*`). These are loaded by macOS at login for various features. We divide them into two categories:

- **Critical System Processes (Do Not Disable):** These are essential for the smooth operation of macOS or the user session. Examples include **WindowServer, loginwindow, Dock, Finder,** etc., which may not appear directly as launchctl entries (they are started by other means), as well as certain agents that manage system-level functionality. For instance, **securityd** (handles keychain access), **usernoted** (delivers user notifications), **cfprefsd** (preferences daemon), **pboard** (clipboard server), and **launchservicesd/lsd** (app launching services) are all core components. If any such processes are listed, do **not** disable them – the system expects them to be running. Generally, any `com.apple` item that you *don’t understand or recognize as an optional feature* should be left alone. Apple’s own daemons/agents have been refined to be efficient and usually won’t slow down your Mac [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Most%20of%20Apple%27s%20system%20daemons,hardly%20ever%20notice%20them%20running). Only disable Apple processes if you are sure of their purpose.

- **Optional macOS User Agents:** macOS also launches many feature-specific services at login which are **not critical** to the core system – they only support certain apps or user features. These can be safely disabled or removed **if** you do not use the associated feature. For example:  
  - **iCloud and Photos:** `com.apple.cloudphotod`, `com.apple.photolibraryd`, and **photoanalysisd** manage iCloud Photos syncing and photo analysis (face recognition, etc.). If you don’t use the Photos app or iCloud Photo Library, you can disable these to save memory/CPU [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27) [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Siri:** `com.apple.assistantd` and `com.apple.assistant_service` (Siri agents) can be turned off if you never use Siri on your Mac [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Game Center:** `com.apple.gamed` runs to support Game Center. Safe to disable if you don’t play Mac games that use it [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Messages/FaceTime:** `com.apple.imagent` (iMessage agent), `com.apple.avconferenced` (FaceTime backend) – disable these if you don’t use Messages or FaceTime on the Mac [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Home (HomeKit):** `com.apple.homed` – safe to disable if you don’t use the Home app for HomeKit devices [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **News:** `com.apple.newsd` – can be off if Apple News is not used [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Screen Time:** `com.apple.ScreenTimeAgent` – optional, if you don’t need usage monitoring on this Mac [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).  
  - **Reminders and Calendar:** `com.apple.remindd` (Reminders) and `com.apple.CalendarAgent` – optional if you don’t use those apps (or if you do, keep them).  
  - **Others:** `com.apple.knowledge-agent` (Siri knowledge suggestions), `com.apple.parsecd` (Spotlight/Siri parsing), `com.apple.cloudd` (generic iCloud syncing), `com.apple.itunescloudd` (Apple Music library sync), `com.apple.familycircled` (Family Sharing), `com.apple.screensharing.agent` (if you don’t use Screen Sharing), etc., are all examples of macOS services that aren’t mandatory [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27) [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27). Disabling them will turn off or hinder that specific functionality, but should not destabilize the OS.  
  
  **Important:** Before disabling any system agent, ensure you truly don’t need the feature. Stopping these will **prevent their function** (for instance, no iCloud sync or no Siri responses). Also note that starting with macOS Catalina and later, System Integrity Protection (SIP) may prevent permanent removal of Apple launch agents; instead you must use `launchctl disable` to turn them off per user [command line - Disabling services (daemons, agents) with launchctl - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/471436/disabling-services-daemons-agents-with-launchctl#:~:text=So%20for%20your%20specific%20services,the%20correct%20commands%20are). This writes to a system overrides file rather than deleting the plist. Disabling SIP is sometimes required to modify certain LaunchAgents. Proceed with caution and document which services you disable so you can re-enable if needed.

## Delaying Non-Essential Startup Items  
Rather than outright disabling a useful (but non-critical) login item, you might choose to **delay its launch**. This means it will still run automatically, but only after a short wait, allowing your Mac’s initial login to complete and become responsive faster.

**Methods to introduce a delay:**

- **Use a “Delay Start” Utility:** Apps like **Delay Start** or **DelayedLauncher** can stagger the launch of login items by a set amount of time [How to Stop Mac Apps From Launching at Startup | PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/stop-mac-apps-from-launching-at-startup#:~:text=5,Software). For example, you could set Google Drive to start 2 minutes after login, and Adobe CC 5 minutes after login, so they don’t all compete at once. Tools like **Lingon X** (a launchd editor) can also schedule an app to open at a specific time or with a delay [How to Stop Mac Apps From Launching at Startup | PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/stop-mac-apps-from-launching-at-startup#:~:text=5,Software). These utilities provide a user-friendly way to manage delayed startup without manual scripting.

- **Automator or AppleScript:** You can create an Automator application that first runs a **Pause** action (for X seconds) and then launches the desired app(s) [Delay Items in User Login - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7755335#:~:text=Nov%2020%2C%202016%2011%3A03%20AM,in%20response%20to%20chapelroad). Save this Automator workflow as an app (e.g. “DelayedGoogleDrive.app”) and add **that** app to your Login Items. It will wait for the specified time, then start the target program. This is a straightforward way to introduce delays for one or multiple processes. (Similarly, an AppleScript could do `delay 60` then `tell application "Google Drive" to launch`.) [Delay Items in User Login - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7755335#:~:text=Nov%2020%2C%202016%2011%3A03%20AM,in%20response%20to%20chapelroad)

- **Custom Launch Agent Script:** For advanced users comfortable editing plist files, you can modify or create a LaunchAgent that invokes a shell script with a sleep. For instance, disable the original launch-at-login for a given agent (set `RunAtLoad` to false or unload its plist), and create a new LaunchAgent that runs at login and executes a script like: `sleep 30 && open /Path/To/YourApp.app`. This way launchd will only start the app after the sleep timer. (This approach is more involved and requires maintaining the custom plist script, so using a dedicated delay app as above is often simpler.)

Delaying startup apps can significantly improve perceived performance because your desktop becomes usable sooner. The apps still launch in the background after the delay, staggered rather than all at once [How to Stop Mac Apps From Launching at Startup | PCMag](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/stop-mac-apps-from-launching-at-startup#:~:text=5,Software). This is especially helpful for apps that sync or use heavy resources at start (cloud drives, updaters, etc.). Keep in mind that a delayed app is still automatic – if you truly don’t need it every session, you may prefer to disable it entirely.

## Process Classification Table  
Below is a table summarizing the processes from the `launchctl list` (user login context) that we’ve discussed, with their classification and recommended action:

| **Process Label (Launchctl)**                | **Status**        | **Recommendation**          | **Description**                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud` (and other Adobe CC agents like CoreSync, CCXProcess, CCLibrary, AdobeGC) | **Optional** | **Disable at login** (or delay) – not needed for OS; run manually for updates | Adobe Creative Cloud background services for app updates, cloud file sync, and license checks [How to Disable Adobe’s Creative Cloud Background Processes. | by Justin Ross | Medium](https://justin-ross.medium.com/how-to-disable-adobes-creative-cloud-background-processes-fb4e572a628c#:~:text=Library,to%20programmatically%20find%20these%20suckers). Consumes resources; safe to keep off until needed. |
| `com.adobe.GC.AGM` / `com.adobe.GC.Client`   | **Removable**     | **Disable/Remove** if not using Adobe apps – optional license check services | Adobe Genuine software integrity monitors. Not required for app functionality; only verify license legitimacy. Can be removed to save RAM (Adobe may re-enable with updates). |
| `com.setapp.DesktopClient.SetappAgent`      | **Optional**      | **Delay or Disable** – enable only when using Setapp apps regularly | Setapp licensing agent launched at login [Where does Setapp store its files? – Setapp Support](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002037440-Where-does-Setapp-store-its-files#:~:text=Setapp%20creates%20,apps%20on%20the%20system%20launch). Verifies subscription and keeps Setapp apps activated. Not needed 24/7 unless using Setapp apps frequently. |
| `com.setapp.DesktopClient.SetappUpdater`    | **Optional**      | **Disable** for faster startup (manual updates instead) | Setapp background updater [Where does Setapp store its files? – Setapp Support](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002037440-Where-does-Setapp-store-its-files#:~:text=Setapp%20creates%20,apps%20on%20the%20system%20launch). Checks for updates to Setapp apps. Can be safely disabled to reduce background activity (you’ll update apps manually via Setapp app). |
| `com.google.drivefs` (Google Drive File Stream) | **Optional**  | **Delay or Disable** – launch manually or after delay if needed | Google Drive for Desktop sync client. Auto-mounts Drive at login [Google Drive File Stream for macOS - UNC Asheville ITS](https://kb.unca.edu/kb/google-drive-file-stream-for-macos#:~:text=Google%20Drive%20File%20Stream%20for,found%20in%20your%20%2FApplications%20folder). Heavy on CPU/disk; safe to prevent auto-launch when not needed. |
| `com.google.keystone.agent` (Google Keystone) | **Optional**  | **Disable** – run updater manually occasionally | Google’s auto-updater for Chrome/Drive, etc. Runs at login to silently update Google software. Not essential; can be disabled to stop background update checks (just update apps manually) [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality). |
| `com.hegenberg.BetterTouchTool` (BetterTouchTool) | **Optional** | **Enable or Delay** as per use – disable if unused | BetterTouchTool utility for gestures/shortcuts. User convenience app, not required for OS. Keep at login if you use its features often; otherwise disable auto-start. |
| `com.surteesstudios.Bartender` (Bartender)  | **Optional**      | **Enable or Delay** as needed – purely user preference | Bartender menu bar organizer. Not system-critical. Safe to disable auto-launch and run it on demand. If always used, leaving it at login is fine (low impact). |
| `com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred` (Alfred)    | **Optional**      | **Enable** (if primary launcher) or **Disable** (if redundant) | Alfred launcher app. Optional; disable at login if you prefer an alternative (Spotlight or Raycast). No harm in keeping it if you use it constantly. |
| `com.raycast.macos` (Raycast)               | **Optional**      | **Enable** (if primary) or **Disable** (if not used) | Raycast launcher. Similar to Alfred – not needed for OS. Only one launcher app needs to auto-run; you can disable whichever you use less. |
| *Apple: `com.apple.cloudphotod`*            | **Optional**      | **Disable** if not using iCloud Photos | iCloud Photos sync agent [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27). Consumes resources to upload/download photos. Safe to turn off when iCloud Photos is unused (preventing Photos sync). |
| *Apple: `com.apple.photoanalysisd`*         | **Optional**      | **Disable** if Photos app not used or face recognition not wanted | Photos app background analysis [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27) (scans images for faces, etc.). Safe to disable to save CPU; it will pause Photos analysis until re-enabled. |
| *Apple: `com.apple.gamed`*                  | **Optional**      | **Disable** if not playing games (Game Center) | Game Center daemon [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27).

| *Apple: `com.apple.newsd`* (News)           | **Optional**      | **Disable** if Apple News not used | Apple News fetch agent [Disable-Sonoma-Bloatware.sh · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/b0gdanw/812997a189f72f3953e0a1bb237f783d#:~:text=%27com.apple.cloudd%27%20,%27com.apple.familycontrols.useragent%27). Consumes data/CPU periodically to update News. Turn off if you never read News on Mac. |
| *Apple: `com.apple.ScreenTimeAgent`*        | **Optional**      | **Disable** if Screen Time not needed | Screen Time tracking for usage and parental controls. Can be turned off to stop usage logging. |
| *Apple: `com.apple...` [Various others]*    | **Critical** or **Optional** | **Varies** – see notes | There are many Apple launch agents. If unsure of a service’s role, treat it as **Critical** and leave it enabled. Only disable those you recognize as unnecessary for **your** usage. When in doubt, research a specific label before disabling. |

*Table Legend:* **Critical** = essential macOS component (do not disable); **Optional** = not essential, can be delayed or disabled if not actively used; **Removable** = truly safe to remove/disable entirely if desired (usually third-party updaters or extras). Always keep track of which services you disable so you can re-enable if needed.

## Conclusion  
By reviewing your `launchctl list` login items, we identified numerous third-party services and optional macOS agents that can be tuned for a leaner startup. Disabling or delaying non-essential items – especially heavy third-party updaters and cloud sync clients – will free up resources and improve login speed [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality) [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality). Use the classification above to decide which processes you truly need at login. 

For each item you choose to modify, follow best practices: use the app’s own settings to disable auto-start when available (for example, disable “Launch at login” in Adobe CC [How do I remove Adobe Creative Cloud from… - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252554423#:~:text=2,to%20launch%20at%20startup%20off), Google Drive, etc.), or toggle the item off in **System Settings > General > Login Items** (in the “Allow in Background” list on macOS Ventura+). For deeper control, you can use `launchctl bootout`/`disable` commands to stop LaunchAgents (remember to specify the correct domain like `gui/501/Label` for user agents) [command line - Disabling services (daemons, agents) with launchctl - Ask Different](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/471436/disabling-services-daemons-agents-with-launchctl#:~:text=So%20for%20your%20specific%20services,the%20correct%20commands%20are). If you remove or move plist files, keep a backup as noted, so they can be restored if needed [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality) [How to speed up Mac by killing Daemons and Agents](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/daemons-and-agents-could-be-slowing-down-your-mac#:~:text=Once%20you%27ve%20determined%20which%20background,you%20want%20to%20restore%20functionality).

Lastly, remain cautious with Apple’s built-in services: only disable those you’re confident you don’t need, and be prepared to re-enable them if some macOS feature stops working. With a careful approach, you can safely slim down your Mac’s startup routine to only the essentials, making your system faster while still loading any apps **you** deem necessary – but on your terms (delayed or on-demand rather than all at once). Happy tweaking!
