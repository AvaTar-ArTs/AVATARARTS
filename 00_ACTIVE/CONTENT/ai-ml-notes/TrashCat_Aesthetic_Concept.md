That’s a sick concept—trashCaT embodies that perfect fusion of urban rebellion and scrappy charm. I’m picturing a visual world where neon splashes against cracked alley walls, littered with half-finished graffiti tags, and your feline mascot prowls the scene, rocking a torn hoodie with paint stains. Maybe one glowing eye, like a cyberpunk touch, and jagged whiskers that look almost spray-painted. 

The sound design could lean into gritty, distorted beats—like a fusion of punk rock’s rawness with underground electronic grit. Think of alleyway reverb, distant sirens, the occasional metal trash lid clatter woven into breakbeats. Lyrically, trashCaT could embrace themes of survival, mischief, and making beauty out of wreckage.

For branding, a hand-scrawled or stencil-style logo would slap. Maybe some sticker-style street art visuals—imagine a recurring motif of your scrappy mascot stenciled onto walls in different cities, tagging its presence like an underground legend.

Would you want this concept explored visually, musically, or in a branding sense? I’d love to help refine the aesthetic further.

I see you've uploaded several images—looks like they're heavily in line with the **TrashCaT** aesthetic: neon-lit urban rebellion, raccoon rockstars, and gritty punk alley vibes. Do you want me to refine these images, extract elements for branding, or use them as a base for generating new visuals? Let me know how you want to push this forward!

I see you've uploaded multiple CSV files. Could you let me know what you'd like me to do with these files? Are you looking for an analysis, keyword optimization, or something specific related to the **TrashCaT** aesthetic?

I've organized and combined the data from your CSV files, adding a "source_file" column to clearly indicate each entry's origin. Let me know if you need any further analysis, cleanup, or sorting!
