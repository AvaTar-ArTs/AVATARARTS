  "prompt": "A grunge-punk raccoon named Sammy stands triumphantly beneath a flickering 'DUMPSTER FIRE HAPPY HOUR' neon sign. His raccoon band is silhouetted behind him, alley walls glowing with graffiti of his lyrics: 'Love ballads soft in the dark.' Sammy wears a leather jacket with bottle-cap studs, his eyes burning with hope. The scene is bathed in harsh magenta and toxic green lighting, with cracked neon-pink typography dripping like liquid light. Urban, cinematic, 9:16 aspect ratio, vertical composition, moody indie-folk atmosphere, HeartBreak Alley setting.",

  "prompt": "**Title: MoonHowl Assembly**\n\n**Origin Story:** In a neon-drenched undercity, where sewer steam glows and love letters are etched into bricks, a band of misfit performers gathers. Led by Juno Flickerfang, a synth-shredding coyote with a stitched-up eye and glowing banjo, they rage against betrayal. Their music is haunted folk-punk, echoing off rusted scaffolding and broken fire escapes, igniting dormant hearts.\n\n**Main Figure:**\n**Name:** Juno Flickerfang\n**Character:** A cyber-coyote with tangled neon-blue hair.\n**Outfit:** Wearing a torn trench coat with sound-reactive patches.\n**Accessories:** Sporting a hacked banjo and lens-covered goggles.\n**Posture:** Standing defiantly on a trash altar.\n**Genre:** Folk-punk rebellion\n\n**Background:**\n**Setting:** A drenched, post-love alleyway.\n**Walls:** The walls are layered in decaying tour posters and bioluminescent tags.\n**Details:** Neon puddles reflect cryptic lyrics, drones fly by with band flyers.\n\n**Typography:**\n**Font Style:** Jagged graffiti-style with glow effects.\n**Text Placement:** Mid-left, curved along a broken pipe.\n**Text Content:** “MOONHOWL ASSEMBLY”\n\n**Lighting and Color:**\n**Lighting:** Electric blue spotlight from above, rimmed in blood-orange leak.\n**Colors:** Vivid cyan, oxidized bronze, rust-red highlights.\n\n**Instructions:** Isolate the figure and elements on a solid, moody background suitable for vertical print.
