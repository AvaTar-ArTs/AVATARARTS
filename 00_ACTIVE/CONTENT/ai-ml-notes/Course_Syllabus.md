#### **Course Description:**

This course introduces students to a hands-on guided investigation of basic concepts and techniques of visual organization.  No prior experience in art is required.  Through a survey of basic media in a studio environment, students will acquire a working knowledge of fundamental principles of visual art and familiarize themselves with the basic vocabulary necessary to communicate their creative process and thinking.  Art Fundamentals exposes students to a variety of visual arts disciplines including design, drawing, collage, and painting.  Measurable Assessments for this course are accomplished through assignments, quizzes, papers, and projects.

- One package of two 16"x20" stretched canvases

#### **Technology Requirements:**

- Daily access to a computer. 
- A web browser (a recent version of Firefox, or Chrome).
- Additionally, you will need access to a digital camera (a camera phone is fine)
- Microsoft Word, which is available through SFC Office 365 on the [SFC student resource page](https://www.sfcollege.edu/students/).

*Students' knowledge and operation of their own computer is their personal responsibility when taking an online course.*                                                            

#### **Netiquette:**

Netiquette is etiquette on the Internet, or expectations for online communications. This is a college-level course, and your communication in this class should reflect this. When communicating with the instructor or your classmates, be sure that your messages are respectful, civil, and reflect college level writing. Here are some guidelines for your communications:

1. Do not use shorthand expressions like you might do in texting. For example, "u" for you, "w/" for with, LOL, BTW, IMHO, etc. The pronoun "I" is always capitalized. The text editor in Canvas does not automatically capitalize "I" like your smartphone does.
2. Be sure to use proper grammar and punctuation; note that typing IN ALL CAPS is the equivalent of shouting.
3. Remember that body language and tone (such as a joking or sarcasm) may be difficult to perceive by others online, which may lead to misunderstandings.
4. Discussion boards are visible to the entire class; if you have a private question for a classmate or the instructor, you should use the Canvas email system instead.
5. Respect for everyone is paramount, even if you disagree with someone. Everyone's opinion is valid just as yours is. As outlined in the **[Student Code of Conduct](http://www.sfcollege.edu/Assets/sf/rules/pdfs/Rule_7/7_23.pdf "Student Code of Conduct")**, Santa Fe College prohibits harassment and discrimination.

#### 

**Method of Evaluation**

You will be evaluated on a number of activities this semester, each with a unique set of requirements that are listed in separate sections of Canvas. All major assignments have accessible rubrics so you can see how you will be evaluated. If a project has been submitted on the due date but receives an unsatisfactory grade, the student has the option to rework or redo the project for an improved grade.  Semester Incomplete "I" grades will only be awarded if the student has completed 75% of the required assignments. The last day to resubmit work is the last day that the final quiz is open. Below is a description of how your final grade is calculated.  

ART PROJECTS (60%)  
DISCUSSIONS (25%)  
PERSONAL ART REVIEW ESSAY (10%)  
FINAL VOCAB QUIZ (5%)  

#### **Grading Scale**

A             90 – 100

B+           86 – 89

B             80 – 85

C+           76 – 79

C             70 – 75

D+           66 – 69

### **Course Policies:**

#### **Instructor Student Contact**

Communication is critical for your success in online courses. This course will use Canvas as a Learning Management System but all questions related to the course materials and activities should be sent within canvas messaging. This gives us one point of contact and place to check for messages.

There is a scheduled Zoom office hour each week, if you are unable to make that office hour and you have any questions, we can schedule a Zoom meeting.

#### **Attendance Policy**

In order to fulfill the attendance policy of attending the first-class meeting, students must log into Canvas and enter the online class site during the first week of the term.

#### **Late Work**

In order to receive full credit for work, students must turn in required deliverables on the specified due date. Late work is accepted for all assignments except the Peer Review Essay Draft. A grade deduction of 10% will be applied to all late work. Semester Incomplete "I" grades will only be awarded if the student has completed 75% of the required assignments.

#### **Make Up Work**

Assignments can be made up if extenuating circumstances occur. Please contact the instructor to discuss your circumstances.
