Absolutely! Here's a guide to crafting **detailed, narrative-driven image prompts** for your TrashCats universe, incorporating transitions, filler images, and typography notes. This approach leverages "template word" logic to enhance storytelling, context, and emotional depth.

Below is a structured template system. Each prompt uses placeholders like {{character}}, {{emotion}}, {{scene}}, or specific lyrics/lines, allowing adaptation for any song section, character, or theme—**without hardcoding**. This flexibility supports batch generation or narrative remixing.

**TrashCats Narrative Image Prompt Template System**

**1. Cover Image Template**

**Prompt:**

Title: {{song_title}} – {{episode_name}} (Cover Image)

Visual: A wide-angle, cinematic shot of {{scene}} in HeartBreak Alley. Focus on {{character}}, depicted {{emotion}}, framed by neon-lit graffiti, flickering alley lights, and symbolic objects (e.g., a cracked guitar, spray-paint can, or torn band poster).

Typography: Bold, distressed font reading “{{main_lyric_or_theme}}” integrated into the environment—spray-painted on a dumpster, carved into a wooden sign, or glowing in digital haze.

Lighting & Color: High-contrast neon (pinks, cyans, golds) against deep shadows, with rain or mist for mood.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 9:16.

SEO/Platform Notes: Use trending keywords (“trashpunk,” “grunge,” “nocturne melodies”) for YouTube/Etsy.

**2. Transition Image Template**

**Prompt:**

Title: {{song_title}} – {{transition_name}}

Visual: A close-up on a symbolic object ({{object}}) associated with {{character}}’s journey. The object is set against a blurred backdrop of graffiti walls or neon reflections.

Typography: Fading or glitching text (“{{transition_lyric}}”) appears through dripping ink or smoke, subtly woven into the surface of the object (e.g., the handle of a trashcan, or reflected in a puddle).

Lighting & Color: Muted, dreamlike colors with spot highlights.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 1:1.

**3. Main Image Template**

**Prompt:**

Title: {{song_title}} – {{main_event}}

Visual: The core action or emotional moment—e.g., {{character}} and the raccoon band performing atop overturned dumpsters, or a showdown with the howling alley cat under a neon sign. Surroundings show chaos (trash fires, urban critters, torn posters).

Typography: Bold, jagged, or shattered fonts (“{{core_lyric}}”) stenciled onto walls or glowing across a neon sign—integral to the scene.

Lighting & Color: Electric purples, toxic greens, harsh whites; strong contrast for drama.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9 or 9:16.

**4. Filler/Reflection Image Template**

**Prompt:**

Title: {{song_title}} – {{reflection_theme}}

Visual: A quieter, reflective moment—e.g., {{character}} crouched in shadow, spray-painting lyrics, or lost in memory beneath a willow tree. Discarded objects (photos, letters) scatter in the background.

Typography: Handwritten, faded text (“{{filler_lyric}}”) appears on a wall, lantern, or crumpled paper—evoking nostalgia or loss.

Lighting & Color: Warm, nostalgic golds and ambers; gentle shadows.

Aspect Ratio: 1:1 or 16:9.

**5. Next-Scene Transition Image Template**

**Prompt:**

Title: {{song_title}} – {{next_scene}}

Visual: Pull back for a panoramic or overhead view—revealing more of HeartBreak Alley, the community, or the next stage of the story (e.g., a riot, alley gathering, dawn breaking over the city).

Typography: Ghostly, echoing text (“{{final_lyric}}”) fades into the background—etched into mist or distant billboards.

Lighting & Color: Fading night blues, early dawn pastels.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9.

**How To Use Template Words: Best Practices**

- **Placeholder Variables:** Use intuitive variables: {{character}}, {{emotion}}, {{object}}, {{main_lyric}}, {{scene}}, etc. This ensures the core structure of each prompt remains, allowing quick swaps for new images or story sections.

- **Batch Processing:** Fill placeholders with lyrics, character names, or narrative beats for each batch—manually or via automation.

- **Consistent Style & Typography:** Use template notes to ensure recurring motifs—bold fonts for rebellion, handwritten for nostalgia, glitchy for digital/cyberpunk, always embedded into the environment (never pasted on).

- **SEO & Platform Focus:** Always include a {{title}} placeholder optimized for YouTube/Etsy, incorporating trend keywords for discoverability.

**Example (filled for a verse):**

**Prompt:**

Title: Sammy’s Serenade – “Moonlit Heartache” (Cover Image)

Visual: A raccoon named Sammy stands in a rain-soaked, neon-lit alley, clutching a battered guitar under the flicker of a broken “HeartBreak Alley” sign. Torn posters and graffiti (“Eat Trash, Love Loud”) frame the scene.

Typography: Bold, cracked white font reading “Moonlit nights and alley lights…” spray-painted diagonally on a dumpster.

Lighting & Color: Electric magenta, cyan, asphalt black.

Aspect Ratio: 16:9.

**Image Series Flow (for your song or any narrative)**

1. **Cover Image:** Set the world, mood, and core visual motifs.
2. **Transition Image:** Symbolic bridge or emotional pivot.
3. **Main Image:** Core action/beat (e.g., showdown, performance).
4. **Filler Image:** Quiet, reflective moment or aftermath.
5. **Next Transition:** Pan out or set up the next scene/chapter.

**Repeat with new variables and themes as the story evolves!**

**In Practice**

- **Automate or repeat for each lyric line/scene:**
  - {{character}} = Sammy
  - {{scene}} = moonlit alley
  - {{emotion}} = heartbreak/defiance
  - {{main_lyric}} = "Sammy sang in moonlit nights"

- **You can even chain prompts:** e.g.,
  - Prompt 1: “Write a main image description for {{song_title}} featuring {{character}} and the lyric {{main_lyric}}.”
  - Prompt 2: “Write a transition image for the narrative moment following: {{main_lyric}}.”
