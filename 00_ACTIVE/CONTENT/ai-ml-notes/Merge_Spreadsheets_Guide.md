I can help with merging the spreadsheets, but I need a bit more detail about what you’re aiming to achieve. For example:

- Do you want to combine data from specific sheets within each spreadsheet into one sheet?
- Should the merge be done row-by-row (appending rows) or column-by-column (joining data side-by-side)?
- Are there matching key columns or unique identifiers that should be used to align the data?
- Would you like to automate this process using a Google Apps Script or another method?

Please provide a little more context about the merge, and I’ll be happy to guide you through the process or provide a solution.
