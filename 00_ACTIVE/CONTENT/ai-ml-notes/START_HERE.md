## Directory Structure (8 Dimensions)

```
organized_v2/
├── PROJECTS/              What you're building
├── WORKFLOWS/             How you work
├── DEVELOPMENT/           Technical artifacts
├── KNOWLEDGE_BASE/        What you know
├── RESOURCES/             Quick references
├── TIMELINE/              When you worked
├── HIGH_ACTIVITY_SPRINTS/ Intensive periods
└── CROSS_PROJECT/         Where things connect
```

**Why multi-dimensional?**

Because your work doesn't fit into neat boxes. A single transcription script might be:
- Part of a project (video_transcription)
- Part of a workflow (transcribe_analysis)
- A development artifact (complete_script)
- Created in a time period (2025_Q3)
- Part of a sprint (2025-09-12)
- Connecting domains (music_video)

**Traditional organization makes you choose ONE.**
**This organization gives you ALL perspectives.**
