---

### **[OPENING SCENE]**  
1. **Prompt:** *A grainy security camera feed showing an empty suburban office parking lot at night. The scene is dimly lit by flickering streetlights, with distant static and distortion on the screen. The camera’s timestamp reads 2:47 AM. A faint silhouette in the distance barely visible through the static. The scene feels cold and abandoned, with an eerie, unnatural stillness in the air.*  

2. **Prompt:** *A low-angle shot of a deserted office hallway, the fluorescent lights buzzing softly. Shadows stretch unnaturally on the walls, as if something unseen is watching from beyond the camera’s range. A static glitch distorts the image, hinting at an unknown presence.*  

3. **Prompt:** *A first-person perspective of a security guard staring at multiple monitors in a dimly lit security office. One screen flickers, showing something wrong—a shadow moving where there should be none. A steaming cup of coffee sits on the desk, forgotten, as dread fills the air.*  

4. **Prompt:** *A slow zoom into a cracked security camera screen with grainy static overlaying the image. In the corner, a faint reflection of something watching from behind the camera, too distorted to fully identify. The unease is palpable.*  

---

### **[ACT 1: THE FIRST NIGHT]**  
1. **Prompt:** *A close-up of a security camera feed showing the East Hallway—Section B. Shadows appear too long, stretching unnaturally, but there is no visible source for the distortion. The timestamp flickers, as if reality itself is glitching.*  

2. **Prompt:** *A dark corridor with old office furniture. The distant sound of dragging can almost be felt in the air. The fluorescent lights flicker violently, casting erratic shadows. A red “EXIT” sign glows ominously at the end of the hall, but something blocks the way.*  

3. **Prompt:** *A blurry, overexposed image from a security camera capturing what looks like footprints appearing on their own across the carpet. The edges of the frame glitch and warp, as if something unseen is interfering with the feed.*  

4. **Prompt:** *A view from inside a security office, looking at the monitor showing an empty hallway. A radio sits on the desk, hissing with static. A voice crackles through: “Section B’s been closed for weeks. You’re alone there.” The camera catches a flicker of movement in the reflection of the screen.*  

---

### **[ACT 2: THE FIGURE ON TAPE]**  
1. **Prompt:** *A security camera shot of an empty office parking lot at 3:14 AM. A lone figure stands in the middle—tall, thin, and unnatural. Its limbs are slightly too long, its posture too rigid. It stares directly into the camera with an eerie stillness, as if it knows it’s being watched.*  

2. **Prompt:** *A close-up of a security feed freeze-frame, zooming in on the figure’s face. The image is blurred, but its wide, unnatural grin is unmistakable. Its eyes are black voids, too deep and empty to be human. The feed flickers, as if the camera itself is rejecting what it sees.*  

3. **Prompt:** *A handheld flashlight beam illuminates a section of the parking lot, cutting through the thick fog. The figure is gone, but the camera still records—something is *wrong* with the air, as if reality is bending.*  

4. **Prompt:** *A distorted security tape frame where the figure seems to be “closer” than before. Its head tilts at an impossible angle, and the timestamp glitches violently. The words “NO ESCAPE” flicker in static across the feed for a split second before vanishing.*  

---

### **[ACT 3: THE CONFRONTATION]**  
1. **Prompt:** *A first-person view of a security guard holding a flashlight in a dark, freezing hallway. A thick mist forms as he exhales. The long corridor seems to stretch unnaturally, elongating with every step. A clicking noise echoes from the darkness ahead.*  

2. **Prompt:** *A low-angle shot of the creature crawling toward the camera—on its elbows and toes, its joints bending backward unnaturally. Its grin is wider now, its eyes hollow voids. The floor beneath it seems to distort as if reality itself is warping around its presence.*  

3. **Prompt:** *A radio on the security desk, crackling with static. The dispatcher’s voice should be clear, but instead, a distorted voice replies: “We’re already here.” The radio display flickers erratically, and the shadows in the room deepen.*  

4. **Prompt:** *A blurred motion shot as the security guard runs down the hallway, his flashlight beam bouncing wildly. In the periphery, something is following—its form is too fast, too inhuman to be real. The hallway stretches longer, as if trapping him in a loop.*  

---

### **[ACT 4: THE UNRESOLVED]**  
1. **Prompt:** *A daylight scene of the police surrounding the office complex, yellow crime scene tape fluttering in the wind. The security office sits in the distance, its monitors now dark. The silence is deafening, as if the night’s horrors never happened.*  

2. **Prompt:** *A VHS tape sitting in a package on a wooden table at home. The sender’s address is blank. The tape is unlabeled, except for the words “WATCH ME” scrawled in red marker. A faint smudge suggests someone—or *something*—touched it recently.*  

3. **Prompt:** *A grainy home security camera feed playing back footage from the narrator’s living room. He is asleep in his chair. Behind him, a dark figure stands, its elongated fingers resting lightly on his shoulder. Its grin is frozen in place, watching.*  

4. **Prompt:** *A final scene of a home security camera feed glitching out. Through the distortion, a set of glowing eyes appears just outside a window. The screen flickers violently, then cuts to black.*
