            "content": "Hmm, let's tackle this user's request about the Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds 2025 scandals. First, I need to parse through all the search results to extract relevant information. The user wants current drama, so focusing on recent events up to July 2025 is key.\n\nStarting with the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. [citation:1][citation:5][citation:7] detail the sexual harassment allegations and countersuits. Blake accused Baldoni of misconduct during \"It Ends With Us\" filming, leading to a $400 million defamation lawsuit from Baldoni against her, Ryan, and their publicist. The New York Times was also sued for $250 million. Important to note that by June 2025, Baldoni's lawsuit was dismissed [citation:3][citation:6], but the core legal issues continue with depositions scheduled.\n\nNext, their public appearances. They skipped major events like the Oscars, SAG Awards, and Met Gala in 2025 [citation:1][citation:2][citation:4]. The reasons cited include the legal stress and not being nominees, but their SNL 50th appearance where Reynolds joked about the lawsuit [citation:8] shows their approach to handling publicity.\n\nRyan's subtle remarks referencing the legal troubles, like at Cannes Lions 2025 [citation:3], indicate his support through humor. Also, his alleged ban from Blake's deposition [citation:6] adds another layer to their dynamic during this period.\n\nIndustry reactions include PR smear campaigns similar to the Depp-Heard case [citation:5][citation:7], SAG-AFTRA supporting Blake, and divided public opinions amplified on social media. The leaked footage and texts [citation:5][citation:10] further complicate public perception.\n\nPersonal impacts involve Blake retreating from public life, supported by Ryan and family [citation:9], and rumors of strained friendships with Taylor Swift [citation:9]. Baldoni's reputation as a feminist advocate is scrutinized [citation:10].\n\nUpcoming dates like the July 17 deposition and March 2026 trial [citation:6] are crucial. The user might want these timelines highlighted.\n\nI will structure the answer into sections: Legal Battles, Public Absences, Industry Impact, Personal Toll, and Future Timeline. Including tables for lawsuits and key events would make the information clearer. Citations need to be accurately placed where each detail originates. Also, note the conflicting narratives in the scandal and how both sides present evidence differently [citation:5][citation:7]."

            "content": "### ⚖️ Legal Battles at the Core\n1. **Sexual Harassment Allegations and Retaliation Claims**:  \n   - In December 2024, Blake Lively sued Justin Baldoni (her co-star/director in *It Ends With Us*), accusing him of sexual harassment on set. Specific incidents included unscripted physical contact during filming, such as Baldoni allegedly dragging his lips down her neck during a silent scene and making inappropriate remarks [citation:1][citation:5][citation:10].  \n   - She further alleged Baldoni and his team (including PR experts Melissa Nathan and Jennifer Abel) orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign to \"bury\" her reputation using social media tactics similar to those used against Amber Heard during the Depp-Heard trial [citation:1][citation:5][citation:7].  \n\n2. **Baldoni's Countersuits and Dismissals**:  \n   - Baldoni denied all allegations and filed a $400 million defamation and extortion lawsuit against Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist Leslie Sloane, and *The New York Times* [citation:1][citation:7]. He separately sued the *NYT* for $250 million, claiming biased reporting [citation:1][citation:5].  \n   - **Major Update (June 2025)**: A New York judge dismissed Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Reynolds and the *NYT*, calling it \"frivolous.\" His $250 million suit against the *NYT* was also dismissed [citation:3][citation:6]. However, Lively's original harassment lawsuit and Baldoni's appeal efforts continue, with a trial set for March 2026 [citation:1][citation:6].  \n\n3. **Evidence Wars and Gag Order Requests**:  \n   - Baldoni's team leaked edited set footage and a 2 a.m. voice note to dispute harassment claims, arguing Lively \"exaggerated benign interactions\" [citation:5][citation:7]. Lively's team countered that the footage *supported* her allegations and accused Baldoni of witness intimidation, requesting a gag order to prevent further media manipulation [citation:5][citation:6].  \n   - Reynolds was implicated in Baldoni's suit for allegedly conspiring to \"accumulate power\" over the film by fabricating the harassment narrative [citation:7]. Reynolds' spokesperson dismissed this as baseless, emphasizing support for his wife [citation:7].  \n\n*Table: Key Legal Developments*  \n| **Date**       | **Event**                                                                 | **Outcome/Status**                                     |  \n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|  \n| Dec 2024       | Lively files harassment suit vs. Baldoni                                  | Ongoing; trial set for March 2026 [citation:1]         |  \n| Jan 2025       | Baldoni sues Lively, Reynolds, and NYT for $400M                         | Dismissed in June 2025 [citation:3][citation:6]        |  \n| July 17, 2025  | Lively's deposition scheduled                                             | Reynolds banned by her lawyers [citation:6]            |  \n\n### 🌟 Public Absences and Subtle Clapbacks\n1. **Award Show Boycotts**:  \n   - The couple skipped the 2025 Oscars, SAG Awards, and Golden Globes, despite Reynolds' *Deadpool & Wolverine* nominations. Sources cited the legal stress as a factor, though reps claimed scheduling conflicts [citation:1][citation:4]. They also avoided the 2025 Met Gala, breaking Lively's past regular attendance [citation:2].  \n   - Their only major appearance was at SNL's 50th anniversary (February 2025), where Reynolds joked, \"Great! Why, what have you heard?\" when asked about the scandal [citation:8].  \n\n2. **Reynolds' Cryptic Remarks**:  \n   - At Cannes Lions 2025, Reynolds quipped, \"I’ve been around lawyers\" when refusing to toss a water bottle, hinting at legal caution amid the battle [citation:3].  \n\n### 💼 Industry and Personal Fallout\n1. **Reputational Damage and PR Wars**:  \n   - Baldoni's image as a feminist ally (*Jane the Virgin*) clashed with Lively's claims, polarizing public opinion. TikTok and X amplified \"armchair legal experts,\" with many users declaring \"Blake Lively is cooked\" [citation:5][citation:10].  \n   - Lively hired Nick Shapiro (ex-CIA deputy chief) as crisis manager, while Baldoni launched a website (*thelawsuitinfo.com*) to \"expose the truth\" [citation:1][citation:5].  \n\n2. **Personal Toll on Lively**:  \n   - She retreated from public life, relying on Reynolds and her sister for support. Rumors swirled about severed ties with Taylor Swift and Gigi Hadid after Baldoni cited Swift in his suit [citation:9].  \n   - **Upcoming Deposition Drama**: Baldoni's lawyer pushed to hold Lively's July 2025 deposition at Madison Square Garden or via livestream \"for transparency.\" Lively's team called this a \"spectacle\" and requested a private setting [citation:6].  \n\n*Table: Key Figures' Stances*  \n| **Figure**         | **Role**                          | **Position in Scandal**                                                                 |  \n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  \n| **Blake Lively**   | Actress/Plaintiff                 | Harassment victim; alleges smear campaign [citation:1][citation:10]                    |  \n| **Justin Baldoni** | Director/Defendant                | Claims conspiracy; reputation as \"feminist\" undermined [citation:5][citation:7]        |  \n| **Ryan Reynolds**  | Lively's husband/Co-defendant     | \"Unwavering support\"; accused of power grabs [citation:7][citation:9]                  |  \n| **NY Times**       | Media defendant                   | Filed motion to dismiss; defended reporting as \"fair and accurate\" [citation:1]        |  \n\n### ⏳ What’s Next?\n- **July 31, 2025**: Lively's deposition (Reynolds barred from attending) [citation:6][citation:9].  \n- **March 2026**: Trial for Lively's harassment lawsuit, though settlements remain possible [citation:1][citation:6].  \n- **Broader Impact**: The case highlights Hollywood's ongoing struggles with power dynamics, smear tactics, and the challenges of #MeToo narratives in polarized times [citation:5][citation:10].  \n\nThis saga remains fluid, with legal maneuvers and PR battles ensuring continued headlines.

I found many search results, so I need to parse them carefully.\n\nFirst, the core legal drama: Lively sued Baldoni for sexual harassment and alleged a smear campaign, while Baldoni countersued for defamation. The key development here is Lively's legal team subpoenaing creators like Perez Hilton, Candace Owens, and Andy Signore, claiming they were part of Baldoni's retaliation scheme [citation:1][citation:4]. \n\nBut the irony jumps out from the search results: these subpoenas targeted mainstream figures, not shadowy operatives. For example, Hilton is a well-known blogger who'd appeared in a documentary about the case [citation:1], and Owens is a high-profile commentator. Even more ironic is YouTuber Kassidy O'Connell's revelation that her only earnings came from Mint Mobile ads starring Ryan Reynolds—Lively's husband [citation:2]. That's a delicious twist the user will likely find compelling.\n\nThe subpoena requests were overly broad, asking for bank details, addresses, and session logs [citation:2][citation:4], which creators called \"invasive\" and \"desperate.\" Some weren't even monetized, like \"The Spiritual Shift,\" who had 2.4K followers and made zero dollars [citation:2]. This undermines Lively's conspiracy theory, suggesting organic criticism instead.\n\nLegally, the judge dismissed Baldoni's $400M suit against Reynolds and the NYT [citation:1], but allowed Lively's harassment claim to proceed. However, her aggressive subpoenas backfired, with creators filing motions to quash and bar complaints [citation:2][citation:4]. PR messages revealed Baldoni's team discussed smear tactics [citation:2], but Wallace (the alleged executor) was dropped from the case [citation:2], weakening Lively's argument.\n\nThe user also mentioned \"mainstream instead of smear 'fakes'.\" This is spot-on: the creators subpoenaed were legitimate commentators, not hidden actors. Baldoni's team argued the backlash was organic [citation:2][citation:6], and the subpoenas felt like intimidation [citation:4]. Even the PR consultant's texts about \"untraceable\" campaigns [citation:2] didn't directly prove Baldoni's involvement.\n\nFor structure, I'll start with the legal context, then detail the subpoenaed creators, highlight the ironies (especially Reynolds funding critics), discuss the legal pushback, and analyze the PR tactics. Tables would help summarize creators and ironies. The tone should be objective but highlight the absurdities, like Reynolds inadvertently bankrolling critics. I'll close with the case status—depositions loom, and the trial is set for 2026 [citation:8].\n\nThis approach balances depth with clarity, using the search results to show how Lively's strategy boomeranged. The user seems interested in the hypocrisy angle, so I'll emphasize that."

Here's a breakdown:\n\n### ⚖️ 1. **The Subpoena Strategy and Targets**\nLively's legal team issued over 60 subpoenas to content creators (e.g., Perez Hilton, Candace Owens, Andy Signore) and tech platforms (Google, X) to uncover proof of a Baldoni-coordinated smear campaign. The goal was to access:\n- **Personal data**: Bank records, home addresses, phone numbers, and session logs [citation:1][citation:2][citation:4].\n- **Financial ties**: Evidence that Baldoni paid creators to attack Lively [citation:1][citation:4].\n\n*Table: Key Subpoenaed Creators and Their Responses*  \n| **Creator**         | **Platform/Influence**       | **Response to Subpoena**                                                                 |\n|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Perez Hilton        | Celebrity blogger/documentary subject | Pledged compliance; noted conflict of interest (past ties to Baldoni's lawyer) [citation:1] |\n| Candace Owens       | Political commentator        | Mocked leak to TMZ; vowed to address on podcast [citation:1] |\n| Andy Signore        | YouTube (Popcorned Planet)   | Called Lively a \"bully\"; accused her of unmasking anonymous sources [citation:4] |\n| Kassidy O'Connell   | Small YouTuber (16K subs)    | Revealed ironic Reynolds link; filed bar complaint [citation:2] |\n| \"The Spiritual Shift\" | X user (2.4K followers)    | Denied monetization; called subpoena \"intimidation\" [citation:2] |\n\n### 🤔 2. **The \"Ironic Natures\" of the Subpoenas**\n#### **A. Mainstream Figures, Not \"Smear Fakes\"**  \nLively targeted high-profile, legitimate commentators—not anonymous trolls. Perez Hilton had appeared in a documentary about the case, while Candace Owens had publicly dissected the lawsuit for months [citation:1][citation:4]. This undermined Lively's narrative of exposing covert operatives.\n\n#### **B. Self-Funding the \"Smear\"?**  \nThe most glaring irony: YouTuber Kassidy O'Connell revealed her only income linked to the case came from **Mint Mobile ads starring Ryan Reynolds** (Lively's husband). She stated:  \n> *\"If I've been paid by anyone involved... it's former party Ryan Reynolds\"* [citation:2].  \n\nThis exposed the absurdity of alleging Baldoni-funded attacks when Reynolds' own ventures inadvertently supported critics.\n\n#### **C. Hypocrisy on Privacy**  \nCreators noted Lively's team previously argued for *her* privacy rights when Baldoni sought her data. O'Connell cited this in her motion to quash:  \n> *\"Ms. Lively herself makes a compelling argument that individuals have a constitutional right to privacy\"* [citation:2].  \n\nYet Lively demanded creators' bank details and location histories—a move labeled \"desperate and paranoid\" [citation:2][citation:4].\n\n### ⚡ 3. **Legal and Public Backlash**\n- **Motions to Quash**: O'Connell and others filed legal challenges, arguing subpoenas were \"overbroad,\" \"invasive,\" and procedurally flawed (e.g., improperly routed through courts) [citation:2][citation:4].\n- **Ethics Complaints**: O'Connell filed a California State Bar complaint against Lively's attorney, Esra Hudson, for \"misuse of legal process\" [citation:2].\n- **Creator Solidarity**: Subpoenaed creators banded together, calling Lively a \"privileged bully\" and framing the action as an attempt to \"silence dissent\" [citation:2][citation:4].\n\n### 🕵️‍♂️ 4. **Did a Smear Campaign Actually Exist?**\n- **Lively's Evidence**: Her team cited texts from Baldoni's PR team (Melissa Nathan) discussing \"$175,000 for a 3-month campaign\" to seed theories and \"change the narrative\" untraceably [citation:2].\n- **Baldoni's Defense**: Social media consultant Jed Wallace claimed creators \"organically supported Baldoni,\" and the judge dismissed him from the case for lack of jurisdiction [citation:2].\n- **Reality Check**: Most subpoenaed creators were independent commentators with no financial ties to Baldoni. As \"The Spiritual Shift\" noted: *\"Zero dollars made... I dared to speak truth to power\"* [citation:2].\n\n### 💎 5. **Key Takeaways and Current Status**\n- **Subpoenas Ruled Overreach**: Judges have yet to rule on most motions, but the dismissal of Wallace and the creators' pushback suggest Lively's theory lacks concrete proof [citation:1][citation:2].\n- **Upcoming Milestones**:  \n  - Lively's deposition (July 31, 2025; Reynolds barred from attending) [citation:1].  \n  - Trial set for March 2026 [citation:8].  \n- **Broader Irony**: Lively sought to expose a covert smear campaign but instead highlighted how mainstream criticism—some funded by her husband—shaped public opinion organically. The subpoenas became a PR liability, painting her as a powerful figure weaponizing the law against critics [citation:2][citation:4][citation:6].\n\nThis saga underscores the perils of using legal tools to combat online criticism, especially when targeting legitimate voices. The fallout has further polarized public opinion, with Baldoni cast as a victim of celebrity power and Lively as increasingly combative [citation:8][citation:10]."
