I’ll let you know once the script is ready for review.

# Full Self-Driving (to Bankruptcy) - Video Script

## Scene 1: Title Card & Introduction  
**Visual:** A highway-yellow background fills the screen, textured like worn asphalt. Centered is the title text *“Full Self-Driving (to Bankruptcy)”* in a retro-futuristic highway sign font, complete with rusted, battered edges. Just beneath the text, a **spinning “LOADING…” wheel** churns endlessly, as if the future is perpetually *loading*. For a moment, the **Tesla "T" logo** appears above the title — then begins to morph and tilt, slowly transforming into a cartoonish **sinking ship** icon disappearing beneath an invisible horizon line. This protest-art style graphic sets the satirical tone from the start.  

**Narration (cheerful, sarcastic):** *“Buckle up, folks! Welcome to the ultimate road trip **to nowhere**. This is **‘Full Self-Driving (to Bankruptcy)’**, the story of how Elon Musk’s self-driving dream car took a sharp turn ... straight off a financial cliff!*”  

**Text Overlay:** *Title appears:* “Full Self-Driving (to Bankruptcy)” (Highway-yellow on asphalt-gray, centered above a spinning “LOADING…” wheel).  

## Scene 2: The Hype Highway  
**Visual:** A stage is set like a flashy tech launch event. Silhouettes of cheering *“tech-bro”* figures pump their fists in excitement. Elon Musk (cartoonified with an overconfident grin) stands under a spotlight next to a sleek Tesla, gesturing broadly. In bold letters behind him, phrases flash like neon signs: “**Revolutionary!**”, “**Autopilot Nirvana**”, “**Next Year for Sure!**”. A graph in the background shows a stock arrow skyrocketing upward. Dollar signs and rocket ship doodles zoom around, illustrating the hype cycle in overdrive.  

**Narration (over-enthusiastic, parody tone):** “Observe the *Tech Bro* in his natural habitat — the product launch stage! Here we have Elon *‘Trust-Me’* Musk unveiling the future, **again**. He promises cars so smart, human drivers will soon be as outdated as horse-drawn buggies. *“Buying a non-self-driving car is like buying a horse in 1919,”* he proclaimed with a straight face. The crowd of fanboys cheers: this is the dawn of a driving revolution! Tesla’s Full Self-Driving will change the world *‘very quickly’*, Musk boasts — **level 5 autonomy, no human attention needed, coming right up!**”  

**Narration (continuing, mocking tech hype):** “The buzzwords fly at Ludicrous Mode speed. *Robotaxis!* **One million of them by 2020,** no less. *Automotive AI messiah*! *Game-changer!* Every grand promise sends Tesla’s stock zooming to the moon 🚀 — faster than a Model S in Ludicrous Mode. Tech investors nod sagely, *‘This will 10x everything, bro!’* They’re **high-fiving** to visions of a robo-chauffeur utopia, convinced that **Elon’s got this**. After all, he’s *“certain”* the Tesla will **find you in a parking lot, pick you up, and drive you anywhere without you touching the wheel**. Certainty from a billionaire? What could possibly go wrong?”  

**Text Overlay:** Behind Musk, flashing buzzwords: “Next Big Thing!”, “Level 5 Autonomous!”, “Million Robo-taxis!”. A speech bubble from Musk: *“No one will need to pay attention – I’m **extremely confident**!”* (parodying an actual Musk promise).  

## Scene 3: Detour into Reality  
**Visual:** The scene cuts to a Tesla on an open road in a more cartoonish, cautionary style. The car’s on-board computer display shows the *“LOADING…” wheel still spinning* endlessly, symbolizing how Full Self-Driving is *perpetually in beta*. Road signs pass by: one reads “CAUTION: Reality Ahead”. We see the Tesla attempt to navigate and it starts behaving erratically – brakes flash on suddenly with no obstacle in sight, then it swerves to avoid an imaginary object. A comical thought bubble above the car shows confusion: a traffic light symbol mixed up with a **crescent moon** and a **Burger King** logo.  

**Narration (deadpan irony):** “Spoiler alert: it **didn’t** work. That shiny ‘Full Self-Driving’ future remained stuck in… well, **permanent beta**. Instead of robotaxis taking over the world, we got Teslas playing bumper cars on autopilot. Turns out, teaching a car to drive itself was a *tad harder* than tweeting about it. Who knew?”  

**Narration (wry, listing failures):** “The **reality check** hit like a pothole at 60 mph. Tesla’s miracle AI struggled with, um, **basic driving**. Red light ahead? The car blissfully blew through it or slammed the brakes for a green one. It even **mistook the full moon for a yellow traffic light**, slowing down on empty highways under starry skies. A Burger King sign on the roadside? Clearly a stop sign… or maybe the car just had a Whopper craving! *Tech bro logic:* if it brakes randomly and swerves unpredictably, that’s not a bug – it’s an ‘*immersive driving experience*’, right?”  

**Narration (matter-of-fact):** “Soon, **FSD** became the butt of every auto joke. Early adopters who paid extra for the *privilege* of being beta testers found themselves more like unwitting beta **crash** dummies. The only thing ‘full’ about Full Self-Driving was the **full list of glitches and close calls**. Highways turned into high-stakes improv theatre: phantom braking here, missed turn there, and a driver shouting *‘TAKE THE WHEEL!’* as the AI cheerfully ignored construction cones. That promised paradise of hands-free driving? Still **“loading…”**, forever.”  

**Text Overlay:** On the car’s dashboard screen: “Error: Reality Not Found – Reverting to Human Control”. Road sign in view: “Next Exit: Disappointment”.  

## Scene 4: Cracks in the Halo  
**Visual:** A collage of news headline-style text and images flashes by in protest-art fashion. Newspaper clippings spin onto the screen with bold titles: “**Safety Regulators Investigate Tesla**”, “**FSD Beta Recall Issued**”, “**Promises Unfulfilled?**”. An animation shows a tiny Tesla car icon approaching a brick wall labeled “Regulations & Lawsuits” and screeching to a halt. In the background, faint silhouettes of concerned officials and angry customers appear holding protest signs. One sign shows a steering wheel and reads “**Hands-On Please!**”, another says “**FSD = Fully Scamming Drivers?**” with a caricature of Elon juggling too many promises. The color scheme here is stark – black, white, and caution-tape yellow – amplifying the feel of protest art and corporate critique.  

**Narration (dramatic, slightly gleeful):** “By now, even the true believers felt the wheel slipping. **Regulators** started tapping the brakes on Musk’s joyride. Investigations launched, lawsuits loomed. The U.S. traffic safety watchdogs were not amused by Tesla’s wild beta experiments on public roads. They issued stern warnings (imagine a very serious voice saying *‘safety is not optional, Mr. Musk’*). When your **“Full Self-Driving” gets officially labeled a *safety recall*, you know the dream has hit a pothole. Ouch.”  

**Narration (sarcastic):** “Investors who once sent Tesla stock to stratospheric heights suddenly got a bad case of vertigo. The hype balloon sprang a leak. Each quarter brought more *“we’re almost there”* excuses, and fewer believers. Musk kept moving the goalposts – *next year*, no, *next next year* – but by now that line was older than a Roadster’s battery warranty. The **corporate hype cycle** had come full circle, and it was **eating its own tail**. You could almost hear the snickering: *‘Full Self-Driving? More like **Full Self-Delusion**!’*”  

**Text Overlay:** Headlines zoom by: “**Tesla Falls Short—Again**”, “**‘Autopilot’ on Autopilot**”, “**End of the Road?**”. A protest sign graphic: “#FSDFail” in big letters.  

## Scene 5: Collapse – The Sinking Ship  
**Visual:** The screen darkens as a stormy sky forms. Front and center, the **Tesla logo** reappears, but now it fully morphs into a silhouette of the *Titanic* with a big “T” on its side. The ship tilts and begins sinking into a stylized ocean of red ink (financial losses). A triumphant, graffiti-styled banner overlays the scene reading “**BANKRUPTCY**” in cracked, bold text. Around the edges, we see cartoon figures (representing skeptics, consumers, maybe even a smug rival CEO or two) joyously **celebrating**. Fireworks made of dollar bills exploding, and confetti shaped like tiny Teslas raining down. It’s a darkly comic victory parade.  

**Narration (gleeful triumph):** “And **boom** – that’s the sound of reality hitting like an imploding starship. In the end, the only thing Tesla’s Full Self-Driving drove **was Tesla itself into the ground**. The stock went into a full-on **autopilot nosedive** – a crash even the *emergency braking* couldn’t stop. Elon’s empire, once soaring high on **hype fumes**, finally ran out of gas. **Tesla files for bankruptcy**: cue the Schadenfreude confetti! The mighty tech titan’s ship has sunk – illustrated quite literally by that logo slipping under the waves.”  

**Narration (mockingly upbeat):** “The **tech bros** and meme-stock cheerleaders look on in disbelief (and maybe queue up some *“thoughts and prayers”* tweets 🙏). But out on the streets, a different crowd is cheering. Critics, safety advocates, and weary ex-Tesla owners throw a block party titled *‘The End of the Road’*. They hold ironic protest signs like **“Full Self-Driving, Full Self-Sinking”** and **“Press F to Pay Respects (FSD)”**. It’s a celebration of corporate comeuppance. At long last, the hype train ran out of track, and boy, are we **grinning** about it!”  

**Text Overlay:** Large red text stamp on screen: “BANKRUPT!”. Graffiti on a wall behind the sinking ship: *“The road to failure was self-driven.”* Party banner: “Mission Accomplished!” (with Tesla logo sinking graphic).  

## Scene 6: Epilogue & Satirical Call to Action  
**Visual:** The final scene adopts a minimalist protest-poster aesthetic. A simple highway-yellow background again, with peeling-paint style text in asphalt-gray. It displays a final satirical quote in bold letters, as if printed on a protest sign for all to see. Below the quote, smaller text shows a call to action or tagline. The spinning “LOADING…” wheel from earlier finally comes to a stop and turns into a flatline __________, emphasizing the end.  

**Narration (calm, tongue-in-cheek):** *“Thus, we conclude our journey: Tesla’s Full Self-Driving – an experiment in tech-bro hubris that went **full self-destruct**. Let this be a lesson from the ashes (or rather, the **splash**): The road to innovation is exciting, but **keep your hands on the wheel** of reality.”*  

**Narrator (final witty tone):** *“Thank you for riding along on this satirical saga. Drive safe out there — especially if your car *promises* it can drive itself! And remember: sometimes the most *revolutionary* idea is just **telling the truth**. **The end.**”*  

**Text Overlay (Final Quote & CTA):** *“The Autopilot has crashed… and so have the hype dreams. Long live human oversight.”*  
*(On-screen below quote:)* **“#FSDFail   #TechBroSatire   #CorporateCollapse”** – *Share if you enjoyed the ride!*

Below is a **single advanced prompt** you can use with DALL·E (or a similar image-generation tool) to create a **vertical (9:16) typography cover image** referencing the Tesla meltdown theme. It’s inspired by the style of your sample images and the “alive typography” concept:

---

**Prompt:**  
“**Create a vibrant, alive typography cover image (1080x1920, 9:16) featuring the text ‘TESLA $0.00 ERROR’ in a bold, glitchy LED style.** The background should be a solid black with intricate, faintly glowing circuit-board patterns. Make the typography appear cracked and flickering, as if short-circuiting. Incorporate a shattered Tesla silhouette or outline at the bottom, with broken glass and sparks suggesting a catastrophic meltdown. A downward-trending red stock line cuts diagonally across the design to emphasize financial collapse. Use a high-contrast color palette (reds and metallic silvers against deep black) for maximum impact. The overall mood should be edgy, digital, and foreboding, capturing the sense of a dramatic downfall.”

---

**Usage Tips:**  
- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels)  
- **Focus on Typography:** Keep the text large and central, with the car and circuit-board details secondary but clearly visible.  
- **Color Balance:** Emphasize red accents for the meltdown theme, with silver/gray circuit lines on black for a high-tech feel.  
- **Composition:** Leave room at the top or bottom for additional channel branding or titles if needed.
