## 🗑️ Cleanup Options

You can now safely remove the duplicate locations since everything is in the main directory:

### Option 1: Archive and Remove
```bash
# Archive to a backup location first
# Then remove original directories
```

### Option 2: Keep as Backup
- Leave originals as backup
- Use main directory as working directory

### Option 3: Selective Cleanup
- Remove only confirmed duplicates
- Keep directories that might have unique content

## 📋 Recommendation

Since all files have been merged into the main directory:
1. **Verify** main directory has everything you need
2. **Test** website functionality
3. **Archive** original directories (optional)
4. **Remove** original directories (optional)

**Main directory is the single source of truth.**
