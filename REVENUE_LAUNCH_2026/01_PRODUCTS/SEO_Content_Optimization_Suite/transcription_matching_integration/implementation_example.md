# Implementation Example: Connecting Music Project Tools to SEO

## Complete Integration Example

The following Python code demonstrates how to connect your music project's transcription and content matching capabilities to the SEO system:

```python
import os
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

# Add the SEO engine to the path
import sys
sys.path.append("/Users/steven/Music/nocTurneMeLoDieS")

from seo_domination_engine import SEODominationEngine

def simple_transcription_seo_integration():
    """
    A simplified example of how to connect transcription data to SEO content
    """
    print("Starting simplified integration example...")
    
    # Initialize the SEO engine
    engine = SEODominationEngine()
    
    # Simulate some transcription data
    sample_transcription = {
        "file_name": "bite_in_the_night322.mp3",
        "transcription": "[0.00s -> 5.23s] I was walking down the alley at night...\n[5.50s -> 10.15s] When I felt a strange bite on my neck...",
        "duration": "3:22",
        "genre": "Humorous Acoustic Folk-Rock"
    }
    
    # Generate SEO content from transcription
    seo_content = f"""# {engine._format_title(sample_transcription['file_name'])} - Full Lyrics & Analysis

## Song Details
- Duration: {sample_transcription['duration']}
- Genre: {sample_transcription['genre']}
- Transcription: {sample_transcription['transcription']}

This content was generated by connecting music project infrastructure to the SEO system. The transcription was automatically created from the original audio file, demonstrating the power of generative automation in content creation.

## Related Content
Based on analysis of 7,115 audio files and 17,860+ related content items in the music project, we've identified several opportunities for internal linking and content enhancement.

    # Save the SEO content
    output_dir = Path.home() / "seo_content" / "transcription_matching_integration"
    output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    
    output_file = output_dir / "example_transcription_seo_content.md"
    
    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(seo_content)
    
    print(f"Created example SEO content: {output_file}")
    return output_file

def _format_title(file_name):
    """Helper function to format title from file name"""
    # Remove extension and duration numbers
    import re
    title = re.sub(r'(\\d{3})\\.mp3$', '', file_name)
    title = title.replace('_', ' ').strip()
    return title.title()
