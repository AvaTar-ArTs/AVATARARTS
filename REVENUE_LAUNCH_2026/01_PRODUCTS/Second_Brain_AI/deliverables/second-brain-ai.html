            <h2>What is a Second Brain?</h2>
            <p><strong>A second brain is an AI-powered knowledge management system that organizes, connects, and makes searchable all your content, ideas, and knowledge.</strong> Instead of scattered files and notes, your second brain uses semantic analysis to understand the meaning of your content, builds knowledge graphs showing relationships between ideas, and lets you search by meaning—not just keywords. Discover connections you didn't know existed.</p>
            
            <p>Perfect for knowledge workers, researchers, creators, and anyone who wants to turn their content into a searchable, connected knowledge base powered by AI understanding.</p>
