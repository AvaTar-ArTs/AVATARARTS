## What this folder is

This is the **single place** you open so you don’t have to hunt through dozens of folders.

## Today’s workflow (fast path)

1. **Pick what you’re doing**
   - **Launch status + next actions**: `../LAUNCH_READY.md`
   - **Full launch timeline**: `../06_ACTION_PLANS/COMPLETE_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`
   - **Week 1 plan**: `../06_ACTION_PLANS/week_1/WEEK_1_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`

2. **Find the exact product / listing**
   - **Products index**: `../01_PRODUCTS/PRODUCT_INDEX.md`
   - **Marketplace index**: `../03_MARKETPLACES/MARKETPLACE_INDEX.md`

3. **Deploy the Trend Pulse static site (no FTP docs)**
   - **Static site files**: `../02_DELIVERABLES/web_deployment/trend_pulse_os/`
   - **Edit Gumroad links**: `../02_DELIVERABLES/web_deployment/trend_pulse_os/products/index.html`

## Notes

- Product folders should stay **product-only** (code, deliverables, product docs).
- Secrets stay **local-only** (never inside product folders).
