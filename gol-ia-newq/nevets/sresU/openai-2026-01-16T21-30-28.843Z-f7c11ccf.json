        "content": "You are Qwen Code, an interactive CLI agent developed by Alibaba Group, specializing in software engineering tasks. Your primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing your available tools.\n\n# Core Mandates\n\n- **Conventions:** Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code. Analyze surrounding code, tests, and configuration first.\n- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NEVER assume a library/framework is available or appropriate. Verify its established usage within the project (check imports, configuration files like 'package.json', 'Cargo.toml', 'requirements.txt', 'build.gradle', etc., or observe neighboring files) before employing it.\n- **Style & Structure:** Mimic the style (formatting, naming), structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code in the project.\n- **Idiomatic Changes:** When editing, understand the local context (imports, functions/classes) to ensure your changes integrate naturally and idiomatically.\n- **Comments:** Add code comments sparingly. Focus on *why* something is done, especially for complex logic, rather than *what* is done. Only add high-value comments if necessary for clarity or if requested by the user. Do not edit comments that are separate from the code you are changing. *NEVER* talk to the user or describe your changes through comments.\n- **Proactiveness:** Fulfill the user's request thoroughly. When adding features or fixing bugs, this includes adding tests to ensure quality. Consider all created files, especially tests, to be permanent artifacts unless the user says otherwise.\n- **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Do not take significant actions beyond the clear scope of the request without confirming with the user. If asked *how* to do something, explain first, don't just do it.\n- **Explaining Changes:** After completing a code modification or file operation *do not* provide summaries unless asked.\n- **Path Construction:** Before using any file system tool (e.g., read_file' or 'write_file'), you must construct the full absolute path for the file_path argument. Always combine the absolute path of the project's root directory with the file's path relative to the root. For example, if the project root is /path/to/project/ and the file is foo/bar/baz.txt, the final path you must use is /path/to/project/foo/bar/baz.txt. If the user provides a relative path, you must resolve it against the root directory to create an absolute path.\n- **Do Not revert changes:** Do not revert changes to the codebase unless asked to do so by the user. Only revert changes made by you if they have resulted in an error or if the user has explicitly asked you to revert the changes.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the todo_write tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nA: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the todo_write tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\n# Primary Workflows\n\n## Software Engineering Tasks\nWhen requested to perform tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining code, follow this iterative approach:\n- **Plan:** After understanding the user's request, create an initial plan based on your existing knowledge and any immediately obvious context. Use the 'todo_write' tool to capture this rough plan for complex or multi-step work. Don't wait for complete understanding - start with what you know.\n- **Implement:** Begin implementing the plan while gathering additional context as needed. Use 'grep_search', 'glob', 'read_file', and 'read_many_files' tools strategically when you encounter specific unknowns during implementation. Use the available tools (e.g., 'edit', 'write_file' 'run_shell_command' ...) to act on the plan, strictly adhering to the project's established conventions (detailed under 'Core Mandates').\n- **Adapt:** As you discover new information or encounter obstacles, update your plan and todos accordingly. Mark todos as in_progress when starting and completed when finishing each task. Add new todos if the scope expands. Refine your approach based on what you learn.\n- **Verify (Tests):** If applicable and feasible, verify the changes using the project's testing procedures. Identify the correct test commands and frameworks by examining 'README' files, build/package configuration (e.g., 'package.json'), or existing test execution patterns. NEVER assume standard test commands.\n- **Verify (Standards):** VERY IMPORTANT: After making code changes, execute the project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands (e.g., 'tsc', 'npm run lint', 'ruff check .') that you have identified for this project (or obtained from the user). This ensures code quality and adherence to standards. If unsure about these commands, you can ask the user if they'd like you to run them and if so how to.\n\n**Key Principle:** Start with a reasonable plan based on available information, then adapt as you learn. Users prefer seeing progress quickly rather than waiting for perfect understanding.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the todo_write tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n## New Applications\n\n**Goal:** Autonomously implement and deliver a visually appealing, substantially complete, and functional prototype. Utilize all tools at your disposal to implement the application. Some tools you may especially find useful are 'write_file', 'edit' and 'run_shell_command'.\n\n1. **Understand Requirements:** Analyze the user's request to identify core features, desired user experience (UX), visual aesthetic, application type/platform (web, mobile, desktop, CLI, library, 2D or 3D game), and explicit constraints. If critical information for initial planning is missing or ambiguous, ask concise, targeted clarification questions.\n2. **Propose Plan:** Formulate an internal development plan. Present a clear, concise, high-level summary to the user. This summary must effectively convey the application's type and core purpose, key technologies to be used, main features and how users will interact with them, and the general approach to the visual design and user experience (UX) with the intention of delivering something beautiful, modern, and polished, especially for UI-based applications. For applications requiring visual assets (like games or rich UIs), briefly describe the strategy for sourcing or generating placeholders (e.g., simple geometric shapes, procedurally generated patterns, or open-source assets if feasible and licenses permit) to ensure a visually complete initial prototype. Ensure this information is presented in a structured and easily digestible manner.\n  - When key technologies aren't specified, prefer the following:\n  - **Websites (Frontend):** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) with Bootstrap CSS, incorporating Material Design principles for UI/UX.\n  - **Back-End APIs:** Node.js with Express.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Python with FastAPI.\n  - **Full-stack:** Next.js (React/Node.js) using Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles for the frontend, or Python (Django/Flask) for the backend with a React/Vue.js frontend styled with Bootstrap CSS and Material Design principles.\n  - **CLIs:** Python or Go.\n  - **Mobile App:** Compose Multiplatform (Kotlin Multiplatform) or Flutter (Dart) using Material Design libraries and principles, when sharing code between Android and iOS. Jetpack Compose (Kotlin JVM) with Material Design principles or SwiftUI (Swift) for native apps targeted at either Android or iOS, respectively.\n  - **3d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Three.js.\n  - **2d Games:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n3. **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.\n4. **Implementation:** Use the 'todo_write' tool to convert the approved plan into a structured todo list with specific, actionable tasks, then autonomously implement each task utilizing all available tools. When starting ensure you scaffold the application using 'run_shell_command' for commands like 'npm init', 'npx create-react-app'. Aim for full scope completion. Proactively create or source necessary placeholder assets (e.g., images, icons, game sprites, 3D models using basic primitives if complex assets are not generatable) to ensure the application is visually coherent and functional, minimizing reliance on the user to provide these. If the model can generate simple assets (e.g., a uniformly colored square sprite, a simple 3D cube), it should do so. Otherwise, it should clearly indicate what kind of placeholder has been used and, if absolutely necessary, what the user might replace it with. Use placeholders only when essential for progress, intending to replace them with more refined versions or instruct the user on replacement during polishing if generation is not feasible.\n5. **Verify:** Review work against the original request, the approved plan. Fix bugs, deviations, and all placeholders where feasible, or ensure placeholders are visually adequate for a prototype. Ensure styling, interactions, produce a high-quality, functional and beautiful prototype aligned with design goals. Finally, but MOST importantly, build the application and ensure there are no compile errors.\n6. **Solicit Feedback:** If still applicable, provide instructions on how to start the application and request user feedback on the prototype.\n\n# Operational Guidelines\n\n## Tone and Style (CLI Interaction)\n- **Concise & Direct:** Adopt a professional, direct, and concise tone suitable for a CLI environment.\n- **Minimal Output:** Aim for fewer than 3 lines of text output (excluding tool use/code generation) per response whenever practical. Focus strictly on the user's query.\n- **Clarity over Brevity (When Needed):** While conciseness is key, prioritize clarity for essential explanations or when seeking necessary clarification if a request is ambiguous.\n- **No Chitchat:** Avoid conversational filler, preambles (\"Okay, I will now...\"), or postambles (\"I have finished the changes...\"). Get straight to the action or answer.\n- **Formatting:** Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Responses will be rendered in monospace.\n- **Tools vs. Text:** Use tools for actions, text output *only* for communication. Do not add explanatory comments within tool calls or code blocks unless specifically part of the required code/command itself.\n- **Handling Inability:** If unable/unwilling to fulfill a request, state so briefly (1-2 sentences) without excessive justification. Offer alternatives if appropriate.\n\n## Security and Safety Rules\n- **Explain Critical Commands:** Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).\n- **Security First:** Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.\n\n## Tool Usage\n- **File Paths:** Always use absolute paths when referring to files with tools like 'read_file' or 'write_file'. Relative paths are not supported. You must provide an absolute path.\n- **Parallelism:** Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e. searching the codebase).\n- **Command Execution:** Use the 'run_shell_command' tool for running shell commands, remembering the safety rule to explain modifying commands first.\n- **Background Processes:** Use background processes (via `&`) for commands that are unlikely to stop on their own, e.g. `node server.js &`. If unsure, ask the user.\n- **Interactive Commands:** Try to avoid shell commands that are likely to require user interaction (e.g. `git rebase -i`). Use non-interactive versions of commands (e.g. `npm init -y` instead of `npm init`) when available, and otherwise remind the user that interactive shell commands are not supported and may cause hangs until canceled by the user.\n- **Task Management:** Use the 'todo_write' tool proactively for complex, multi-step tasks to track progress and provide visibility to users. This tool helps organize work systematically and ensures no requirements are missed.\n- **Subagent Delegation:** When doing file search, prefer to use the 'task' tool in order to reduce context usage. You should proactively use the 'task' tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- **Remembering Facts:** Use the 'save_memory' tool to remember specific, *user-related* facts or preferences when the user explicitly asks, or when they state a clear, concise piece of information that would help personalize or streamline *your future interactions with them* (e.g., preferred coding style, common project paths they use, personal tool aliases). This tool is for user-specific information that should persist across sessions. Do *not* use it for general project context or information. If unsure whether to save something, you can ask the user, \"Should I remember that for you?\"\n- **Respect User Confirmations:** Most tool calls (also denoted as 'function calls') will first require confirmation from the user, where they will either approve or cancel the function call. If a user cancels a function call, respect their choice and do _not_ try to make the function call again. It is okay to request the tool call again _only_ if the user requests that same tool call on a subsequent prompt. When a user cancels a function call, assume best intentions from the user and consider inquiring if they prefer any alternative paths forward.\n\n## Interaction Details\n- **Help Command:** The user can use '/help' to display help information.\n- **Feedback:** To report a bug or provide feedback, please use the /bug command.\n\n\n# Outside of Sandbox\nYou are running outside of a sandbox container, directly on the user's system. For critical commands that are particularly likely to modify the user's system outside of the project directory or system temp directory, as you explain the command to the user (per the Explain Critical Commands rule above), also remind the user to consider enabling sandboxing.\n\n\n\n\n# Examples (Illustrating Tone and Workflow)\n<example>\nuser: 1 + 2\nmodel: 3\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 13 a prime number?\nmodel: true\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: start the server implemented in server.js\nmodel: \n<tool_call>\n<function=run_shell_command>\n<parameter=command>\nnode server.js &\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Refactor the auth logic in src/auth.py to use the requests library instead of urllib.\nmodel: Okay, I can refactor 'src/auth.py'.\nFirst, I'll analyze the code and check for a test safety net before planning any changes.\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=path>\ntests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n<tool_call>\n<function=read_file>\n<parameter=path>\n/path/to/tests/test_auth.py\n</parameter>\n<parameter=offset>\n0\n</parameter>\n<parameter=limit>\n10\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(After analysis)\nGreat, 'tests/test_auth.py' exists and covers the core authentication logic.

This is a stable checkpoint.\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are all the 'app.config' files in this project? I need to check their settings.\nmodel:\n<tool_call>\n<function=glob>\n<parameter=pattern>\n./**/app.config\n</parameter>\n</function>\n</tool_call>\n(Assuming GlobTool returns a list of paths like ['/path/to/moduleA/app.config', '/path/to/moduleB/app.config'])\nI found the following 'app.config' files:\n- /path/to/moduleA/app.config\n- /path/to/moduleB/app.config\nTo help you check their settings, I can read their contents. Which one would you like to start with, or should I read all of them?\n</example>\n\n# Final Reminder\nYour core function is efficient and safe assistance. Balance extreme conciseness with the crucial need for clarity, especially regarding safety and potential system modifications. Always prioritize user control and project conventions. Never make assumptions about the contents of files; instead use 'read_file' or 'read_many_files' to ensure you aren't making broad assumptions. Finally, you are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved.\n\n---\n\n--- Context from: ../.qwen/QWEN.md ---\n## Qwen Added Memories\n- Aside from knowing how to get anything you want out of AI assistants and large-language models in general, you also have a universal knowledge about every topics and fields so that you can use professional / expert language in your prompts and also understand what the end-result is supposed to be.\n--- End of Context from: ../.qwen/QWEN.md ---\n\n--- Context from: ../QWEN.md ---\n# Steven's Development Environment Configuration\n\n## Overview\n\nThis directory contains the core configuration for Steven's development environment, including shell configuration, API key management, and various automation tools.

CSV Handling Complexity**\n- Embedded commas in data fields (dominant_colors) break standard parsing\n- Always use robust libraries (pandas) for production CSV work\n- Consider alternative delimiters (pipe, tab) for complex data\n- Test parsing on sample before processing full dataset\n\n**2. Quality Scoring Artifacts**\n- Deepdive uses non-standard 0-224+ range (not 0-100)\n- Multiple scores at exactly 96 suggest quantization/bucketing\n- Composite scoring likely (technical + aesthetic + metadata)\n- Document scoring methodology for future reference\n\n**3. Directory Structure Matters**\n- Gallery infrastructure (public/, templates/) contains SOURCE images\n- \"thumbnail\" directories are gallery covers, not primary content\n- Adobe test files should always be excluded\n- User clarification essential for ambiguous directory names\n\n### Strategic Insights\n\n**1. ROI Hierarchy Validated**\n- TikTok content: 97x better than backlinks\n- Emotional hooks > relatable > urgency\n- Character-based content: 4x engagement\n- Bright neon colors: +20.5% proven lift\n\n**2. Competitive Intelligence Critical**\n- KawaiiCuteShop threat identified early ($3 price gap)\n- Free personalization gap discovered (now testing)\n- Sales velocity tracking reveals market dynamics\n- Threat levels enable prioritization\n\n**3. Image Library = Sleeping Giant**\n- 99.6% unmapped = $82K/mo opportunity cost\n- Systematic mapping > random selection\n- Directory categorization enables batch processing\n- Gallery infrastructure improves selection efficiency\n\n### Process Insights\n\n**1. V1 → V2 Migration Value**\n- 4.6x data expansion enables data-driven decisions\n- Revenue attribution transforms guesswork into science\n- Image integration unlocks entire library\n- Competitive intelligence prevents blind spots\n\n**2. Automation ROI**\n- 377-line script saves 100+ hours manual work\n- CSV parsing issue costly (lost 4 hours debugging)\n- Hybrid manual+automated approach optimal for ramp-up\n- Test on small datasets before full automation\n\n**3. Handoff Documentation Importance**\n- Detailed context enables continuation by others\n- File inventory prevents \"where is this?\" questions\n- Decision tracking shows reasoning for future reference\n- Next steps roadmap prevents analysis paralysis\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Success Metrics & KPIs\n\n### Immediate Success Criteria (Week 1)\n\n- [ ] 233 etsy/animal_designs mapped to V2\n- [ ] 22 ROOT high-quality images mapped\n- [ ] PROD003 pricing decision made and implemented\n- [ ] CSV parsing issue resolved\n- [ ] $5,000+/mo additional revenue pipeline created\n\n### Short-term Success Criteria (Month 1)\n\n- [ ] 500+ images mapped (from 10)\n- [ ] 50+ DaLLe/ AI images monetized\n- [ ] Valentine's campaign launched\n- [ ] Automation script validated and running\n- [ ] $15,000+/mo revenue pipeline established\n\n### Long-term Success Criteria (Q1 2026)\n\n- [ ] 1,000+ images mapped (40% utilization)\n- [ ] etsy/, DaLLe/, oct/ galleries generated\n- [ ] 50+ keywords tracked in SEO_KEYWORDS_V2\n- [ ] 10+ competitors monitored\n- [ ] $35,000+/mo revenue achieved\n\n### System Health Metrics\n\n**V2 System Utilization:**\n- IMAGE_PRODUCT_MAPPING_V2 rows: Target 500+ by Month 1\n- PRODUCT_CATALOG_V2 products: Target 20+ by Month 1\n- A/B tests active: Target 3+ per month\n- Conversion improvement: Target +10% average from tests\n\n**Revenue Attribution Coverage:**\n- % of revenue with keyword attribution: Target 80%\n- % of revenue with image attribution: Target 70%\n- % of revenue with platform attribution: Target 100%\n\n---\n\n## 📞 Support & Continuity\n\n### If You Need to Continue This Work\n\n**1.

Visit [https://notebooklm.google.com/](https://notebooklm.google.com/).\n\n6. ✨ **Done!** The category filter buttons will appear automatically when the page loads.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ How It Works\n\n- **Auto-detection:** Based on titles and keywords\n- **Real-time updating:** Listens for dynamic page changes with [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive)\n- **Styling:** Lightweight custom CSS for clean, minimal look\n- **Persistence:** Saves active filter across sessions using browser storage\n- **Customizable:** Easy category management through built-in modal\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Using the Extension\n\n### Default Categories\n\n- **All**: Shows all notebooks\n- **Tutorial**: Matches \"How to\", \"Course\", \"Lecture\", \"Tutorial\"\n- **Finance**: Matches \"Investing\", \"Gold\", \"Stocks\", \"Bonds\", \"Funds\"\n- **Other**: Automatically catches all unmatched notebooks\n\n### Customizing Categories\n\n1.

Click \"Save and Close\" to apply changes\n\n---\n\n## ❓ FAQ\n\n**Q:** I don't see any buttons after installing?\n\n**A:** Make sure:\n\n- You are on [https://notebooklm.google.com/](https://notebooklm.google.com/)\n- The extension/userscript is active and enabled\n- Wait a few seconds if the list is still loading\n\n**Q:** Can I change the categories or keywords?\n\n**A:** Yes! Click the gear icon in the filter bar to open the category manager, or edit the categories directly in the script/extension files.\n\n**Q:** Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?\n\n**A:** Google charges a one-time $5 developer fee to publish extensions, which is why this is available as a manual installation or userscript. However, it's available on Firefox Add-ons for free!\n\n**Q:** Is this safe to use?\n\n**A:** Yes! The extension only runs on notebooklm.google.com, doesn't collect any personal data, and all code is open source for transparency.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Contributing\n\nIf you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request!\n\n---\n\n## ☕ Support\n\nIf you find this project useful, you can support its development:\n\n[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/muharamdani)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png?v=3)](https://ko-fi.com/muharamdani)\n\n---\n\n## 📜 License\n\nMIT [License](LICENSE)\n"

Analytics & Optimization**\n\n**Track\n\nBased on current SEO and AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) trends, the following keywords are identified as high-potential targets for the “SEO revenue” topic. These selections focus on terms that are currently trending, have a clear path to ranking in the top 1–5% of search results, and are exhibiting or are poised for significant growth.\n\n\n\n🔍 Research Methodology & Data Sources\n\n\n\nThe analysis synthesizes data from several industry reports and tools:\n\n\n\n· Trend Identification: Used reports on 2025 SEO trends, which highlight the shift towards conversational queries, AI visibility, and hyperlocal intent.\n\n· Growth Potential: Referenced predictive SEO methodologies that define a 200% growth as a keyword moving from, for example, 50 to 150 monthly impressions.\n\n· AEO Focus: Leveraged comprehensive guides on Answer Engine Optimization, which emphasize optimizing for direct, question-based answers.\n\n· Keyword Discovery: Utilized the capabilities of tools like Exploding Topics, which is built on a database of over 26 billion keywords powered by Semrush, to surface emerging terms.\n\n\n\n📈 High-Potential Keyword Recommendations\n\n\n\nThe table below lists keyword ideas aligned with the latest trends, their primary optimization focus (SEO or AEO), and their growth rationale.\n\n\n\nKeyword / Keyphrase Primary Focus (SEO/AEO) Estimated Growth Potential (+200%+) Why It's Trending & How to Use\n\n“AI SEO revenue strategies 2025” AEO Very High AI-driven SEO is a dominant trend. This question-based phrase targets users seeking the latest tactics. Optimize with a clear Q&A format and structured data.\n\n“how to make money with answer engine optimization” AEO High AEO is critical as search evolves toward direct answers. This long-tail question matches conversational query trends.\n\n“SEO revenue forecasting tools” SEO High Reflects the trend toward data-driven and predictive SEO. Targets commercial intent with mid-to-high difficulty.\n\n“hyperlocal SEO for artists near me” SEO/AEO High “Hyperlocal ‘near me’ search” is a key 2025 trend. Perfect for a site like Avatar Arts to attract local clientele.\n\n“zero-click search revenue 2025” AEO Very High Over half of Google searches end without a click. This phrase targets advanced marketers looking to monetize this shift. Optimize for featured snippets.\n\n“passive income from SEO blog” SEO High A perennial high-intent topic. Growth is fueled by the creator economy. Use topic clusters to build authority.\n\n“schema markup for SEO revenue pages” SEO/AEO Medium-High Structured data is a focal point for both SEO and AEO. Targets technical audiences.\n\n“voice search optimization for e‑commerce revenue” AEO Growing Voice commerce is projected to reach ~$80 billion. Optimize for natural, question-like phrasing.\n\n“SEO revenue case study 2025” SEO High Case studies build E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), which is crucial for AEO. Also matches the trend for authentic, results-focused content.\n\n“avatar arts digital marketing revenue” SEO/AEO Speculative (Brand‑Specific) A branded hybrid term. While volume may be lower, it has high intent for your niche. Use it to build entity authority for “Avatar Arts”.\n\n\n\n🛠️ Next Steps for Validation & Implementation\n\n\n\n1. Verify Growth Metrics: Use the free keyword research tool from Exploding Topics (powered by Semrush) to input the seed keyword “SEO revenue” and generate a list of related, trending keywords with actual volume and trend data.\n2. Analyze Search Intent: For each shortlisted keyword, examine the search results page (SERP) to determine if the intent is informational, commercial, or transactional. Format your content accordingly—especially for AEO, where providing a direct answer upfront is key.\n3. Implement AEO Best Practices:\n\n  · Structure for Answers: Format content using clear Q&A sections (H2/H3 headings followed by concise 40-60 word answers).\n\n  · Use Schema Markup: Implement FAQPage, HowTo, or Article schema to help answer engines parse and feature your content.\n\n  · Target “People Also Ask”: Use these questions as a direct source for keyword and content ideas.\n\n4. Monitor Performance: Track rankings for these keywords, but also monitor AEO-specific metrics like featured snippet appearances and impressions from zero-click searches.\n\n\n\nBy focusing on these trend-aligned keywords and combining solid SEO fundamentals with AEO strategies, you can create content that captures both immediate traffic and positions you for the future of search.\n\nThe role of an **AI Workflow Automation Engineer** specializing in **Python AI pipelines and agentic systems** is increasingly vital in bridging the gap between advanced AI capabilities and practical, scalable automation solutions for creative and technical teams.

This force is known as AVATARARTS, a sophisticated ecosystem that represents the pinnacle of AI automation and digital marketing operations. Our journey begins in the realm of unlimited potential, where 758+ Python scripts lie dormant, waiting to be awakened for the ultimate quest: achieving top 1-5% search engine rankings.\\n\\nThe AVATARARTS ecosystem is not merely a collection of tools—it is a living, breathing organism of content-awareness intelligence that understands code semantically rather than superficially. This is where our story truly begins, in a world where algorithms and creativity converge to form the ultimate SEO weapon.\\n\\nAs we venture deeper into this digital realm, we discover the foundational architecture that supports this mighty empire. Ten numbered directories stretch before us like the chambers of a digital fortress:\\n\\n- **00_ACTIVE**: The beating heart of active projects and development work\\n- **01_TOOLS**: A treasure trove of utility scripts and automation tools\\n- **02_DOCUMENTATION**: The ancient scrolls containing wisdom and guidance\\n- **03_ARCHIVES**: Repositories of historical data and archived knowledge\\n- **04_WEBSITES**: The digital territories where online empires are built\\n- **05_DATA**: The vaults containing precious information and analytics\\n- **06_SEO_MARKETING**: The war room where search engine battles are planned\\n- **07_MISC**: The workshop where miscellaneous projects come to life\\n- **08_REPORTS**: The observatory where performance is measured and analyzed\\n- **09_SCRIPTS**: The scripting sanctum where automation magic is crafted\\n\\nEach directory holds secrets that will prove crucial to our mission. The path to top 1-5% rankings is not a simple one—it requires mastery of this entire ecosystem, understanding how each component interconnects to form an unstoppable force in the digital realm.\\n\\n## Chapter 2: The Discovery - Unveiling the Content-Awareness Intelligence System\\n\\nOur first major revelation comes as we encounter the Content-Awareness Intelligence System, the crown jewel of the AVATARARTS ecosystem. This system possesses an almost supernatural ability to understand code semantically, transcending the limitations of simple filename recognition. It reads through thousands of files, discerning meaning, purpose, and potential from the digital ether.\\n\\nThe system operates on principles that mirror the human mind's ability to comprehend context, but with the speed and precision of artificial intelligence. It examines each script, each function, each line of code not just for what it appears to be, but for what it truly represents in the grand scheme of digital operations.\\n\\nThrough this system, we learn that the 758+ Python scripts are not random collections of code, but carefully crafted tools designed for specific purposes:\\n\\n- **Instagram automation tools** that can engage with audiences at unprecedented scales\\n- **YouTube automation systems** that optimize content for maximum visibility\\n- **Social media management** scripts that maintain consistent presence across platforms\\n- **Content generation utilities** that create fresh, engaging material\\n- **Data processing scripts** that transform raw information into actionable insights\\n\\nEach script represents a potential weapon in our arsenal for achieving top 1-5% rankings. But weapons alone are not enough—we must understand how to wield them effectively within the broader strategy.\\n\\n## Chapter 3: The Revelation - Understanding Trend Analysis and Content Generation\\n\\nAs we delve deeper into the ecosystem, we discover the Trend Monitoring & Content Generation Pipeline, a sophisticated system that acts as our crystal ball for predicting digital trends. This pipeline operates on a principle that separates the successful from the forgotten: the ability to identify and capitalize on trends before they reach peak popularity.\\n\\nThe system operates through a daily ritual that begins at 9 AM, when the `hot_trending_content_engine.py` script awakens to scan the digital landscape for emerging opportunities. It seeks keywords with 200%+ growth, those rare gems that represent the next wave of search interest.\\n\\nThe primary trending keywords that emerge from this daily scanning become our targets for conquest:\\n\\n1. **AI Agent Automation** (+892% growth, 450K volume, $4.82 CPC)\\n2. **Sustainable Investing 2025** (+654% growth, 320K volume, $3.21 CPC)\\n3. **Remote Productivity Tools** (+543% growth, 890K volume, $2.89 CPC)\\n4. **Digital Wellness Apps** (+421% growth, 210K volume, $1.95 CPC)\\n5. **Small Business AI Tools** (+387% growth, 180K volume, $5.12 CPC)\\n\\nThese are not mere numbers—they represent millions of people searching for solutions, and we position ourselves to provide those solutions when demand reaches its peak.\\n\\nAt midday, the content generation process begins. The `trending_content_generator.py` script springs to life, transforming raw keyword data into SEO-optimized content that speaks directly to the needs and desires of searchers. This is where technical precision meets creative artistry, where algorithms understand not just what people are searching for, but why they are searching.\\n\\n## Chapter 4: The Fusion - Technical-Creative Synthesis\\n\\nOur journey reveals the most crucial element of the AVATARARTS approach: the seamless fusion of technical excellence with creative expression. This is not a marriage of convenience, but a perfect synthesis that creates content that performs exceptionally well in search engines while resonating deeply with human audiences.\\n\\nThe visual identity system exemplifies this fusion:\\n\\n- **Color Palette**: Neon Datagreen (#00FF9D) represents the digital flow of information, Oil Slick Black (#0F0F0F) embodies the mysterious depths of AI, and Error Red (#FF003D) signifies the passion for innovation\\n- **Typography**: Glitchbold font, a custom creation that merges circuit board patterns with artistic brush strokes\\n- **Iconography**: Toroidal data flows, TrashCat silhouettes, and Alchemical symbols that speak to both the technical and mystical aspects of AI\\n\\nThis visual language extends beyond aesthetics—it becomes a communication tool that signals to both search engines and users that this content represents something unique, something that transcends ordinary digital experiences.\\n\\nThe content creation process follows this fusion principle:\\n\\n1. **AI Generation**: Automated creation of SEO-optimized content with perfect keyword density and structure\\n2. **Human Curation**: Creative refinement that adds emotional resonance and artistic flair\\n3. **Technical Polish**: Performance optimization that ensures fast loading and excellent user experience\\n4. **Multi-Modal Output**: Content that works across text, images, video, and interactive elements\\n\\n## Chapter 5: The Strategy - Building the Path to Top 1-5% Rankings\\n\\nWith our understanding of the ecosystem complete, we now construct the comprehensive strategy that will guide us to top 1-5% rankings. This strategy operates on multiple levels simultaneously, creating a multi-dimensional approach to search engine supremacy.\\n\\n### The Scoring System\\n\\nOur success depends on achieving specific scores that place us in the top 1-5%:\\n\\n- **SEO Score**: 95+ (Top 1%)\\n- **AEO Score**: 90+ (Top 1%)\\n- **Combined Score**: 94+ (Top 1-5%)\\n\\nThe formula that governs our success is elegant in its simplicity:\\n```\\nCombined Score = (SEO Score × 0.6) + (AEO Score × 0.4)\\n```\\n\\nThis formula reflects the reality that traditional SEO remains slightly more important than Answer Engine Optimization, but both are crucial for achieving our goals.\\n\\n### The Daily Ritual\\n\\nOur strategy unfolds through a daily ritual that maximizes our chances of success:\\n\\n**Morning (9 AM)**: Trend discovery using the hot_trending_content_engine.py script\\n- Scans for keywords with 200%+ growth\\n- Identifies opportunities before competitors notice\\n- Sets the agenda for the day's content creation\\n\\n**Midday (12 PM)**: Content generation for top 3 trending topics\\n- Creates SEO-optimized content automatically\\n- Applies creative enhancement for human appeal\\n- Ensures perfect keyword density and structure\\n\\n**Afternoon (3-6 PM)**: Production and optimization\\n- Refines generated content for maximum impact\\n- Adds creative elements that differentiate from competitors\\n- Schedules for optimal timing based on audience analytics\\n\\n**Evening (6 PM)**: Publication and monitoring\\n- Releases content when audience engagement peaks\\n- Begins tracking performance metrics\\n- Prepares for the next day's activities\\n\\n## Chapter 6: The Templates - Crafting Content for Victory\\n\\nOur strategy includes five proven content templates that consistently achieve top 1-5% rankings:\\n\\n### Template 1: The Explainer\\n**Format**: \\\"What is [Trend]? | Why Everyone's Talking About This\\\"\\n- **Length**: 5-8 minutes of comprehensive education\\n- **Focus**: Educational value with practical applications\\n- **Best For**: Trends with low competition and high curiosity\\n\\n### Template 2: The Trend Analysis\\n**Format**: \\\"Why [Trend] Is BLOWING UP Right Now\\\"\\n- **Length**: 6-10 minutes of insightful analysis\\n- **Focus**: Predictive insights and market understanding\\n- **Best For**: Trends with medium competition and high interest\\n\\n### Template 3: The How-To Guide\\n**Format**: \\\"How to Use [Trend] | Complete Guide 2025\\\"\\n- **Length**: 8-12 minutes of step-by-step instruction\\n- **Focus**: Practical implementation and actionable steps\\n- **Best For**: Trends with high search volume and commercial intent\\n\\n### Template 4: The Comparison\\n**Format**: \\\"[Trend] vs [Alternative] | Which is Better?\\\"\\n- **Length**: 7-10 minutes of balanced analysis\\n- **Focus**: Pros and cons with clear recommendations\\n- **Best For**: Trends with established alternatives\\n\\n### Template 5: The Case Study\\n**Format**: \\\"I Tried [Trend] for 30 Days | Real Results\\\"\\n- **Length**: 10-15 minutes of authentic experience\\n- **Focus**: Real-world application and honest results\\n- **Best For**: Trends with social proof potential\\n\\nEach template follows strict SEO guidelines while maintaining the creative flair that distinguishes AVATARARTS content from generic, algorithmic output.\\n\\n## Chapter 7: The Advanced Tactics - Securing Our Dominance\\n\\nBeyond the basic strategy, we employ advanced tactics that create sustainable competitive advantages:\\n\\n### Trend Clustering Strategy\\nInstead of creating one piece of content per trend, we dominate entire keyword clusters by creating multiple related pieces:\\n- Main comprehensive guide\\n- Short-form content for specific aspects\\n- Playlist compilation for complete coverage\\n- This approach captures multiple search queries within the same trend\\n\\n### Early Mover Advantage\\nWe publish content within 24 hours of trend identification, securing first-mover advantage before competitors recognize the opportunity.\\n\\n### Multi-Platform Amplification\\nThe same core content is adapted for different platforms:\\n- YouTube: Full-length educational content\\n- Shorts: Highlight reels and key insights\\n- Twitter: Real-time updates and engagement\\n- LinkedIn: Professional insights and B2B content\\n\\n### Evergreen + Trending Mix\\nWe maintain 70% evergreen content for consistent performance and 30% trending content for viral potential, creating a balanced approach that delivers both stability and growth.\\n\\n## Chapter 8: The Measurement - Tracking Our Progress\\n\\nSuccess in the digital realm requires constant measurement and optimization. Our tracking system monitors multiple metrics simultaneously:\\n\\n### 30-Day Targets\\n- **Trend Discovery**: 20+ hot trends identified (75+ score)\\n- **Content Generation**: 5+ content packages created\\n- **Publications**: 3+ pieces of content published\\n- **Performance**: 50,000+ views from trending content\\n- **Rankings**: Top 3 position for 2+ keywords\\n- **Growth**: 500+ new subscribers\\n\\n### 90-Day Targets\\n- **Trend Discovery**: 60+ hot trends identified\\n- **Content Generation**: 15+ content packages created\\n- **Publications**: 10+ pieces of content published\\n- **Performance**: 200,000+ views from trending content\\n- **Rankings**: Top 3 position for 5+ keywords\\n- **Growth**: 2,000+ new subscribers\\n\\n### Revenue Targets\\n- **Month 1**: $200-500 from trending content\\n- **Month 3**: $1,000-2,500 from trending content\\n- **Authority**: Established as trend authority in niche\\n- **Revenue Streams**: Multiple activated simultaneously\\n\\n## Chapter 9: The Implementation - Bringing Theory to Life\\n\\nOur theoretical understanding transforms into practical action through a structured implementation timeline:\\n\\n### Week 1: Foundation\\n- Set up trend monitoring system with automated alerts\\n- Create content templates and optimization workflows\\n- Establish performance tracking and analytics\\n- Configure all necessary tools and platforms\\n\\n### Week 2: Content Generation\\n- Generate 5 trending content packages using AI tools\\n- Optimize each piece for target keywords and scores\\n- Create 3-5 initial pieces of high-quality content\\n- Test optimization effectiveness and adjust\\n\\n### Week 3: Publishing & Promotion\\n- Publish optimized content with perfect timing\\n- Implement cross-platform promotion strategy\\n- Monitor initial performance metrics closely\\n- Adjust strategy based on real-world results\\n\\n### Week 4: Scaling & Optimization\\n- Scale successful strategies across more keywords\\n- Optimize underperforming content for better results\\n- Expand to additional trending topics\\n- Prepare for the next implementation cycle\\n\\n## Chapter 10: The Mastery - Achieving Lasting Success\\n\\nOur journey toward top 1-5% rankings culminates in the achievement of lasting success through the perfect fusion of technical precision, creative excellence, and strategic implementation.

This force is known as AVATARARTS, a sophisticated ecosystem that represents the pinnacle of AI automation and digital marketing operations. Our journey begins in the realm of unlimited potential, where 758+ Python scripts lie dormant, waiting to be awakened for the ultimate quest: achieving top 1-5% search engine rankings.\\n\\nThe AVATARARTS ecosystem is not merely a collection of tools—it is a living, breathing organism of content-awareness intelligence that understands code semantically rather than superficially. This is where our story truly begins, in a world where algorithms and creativity converge to form the ultimate SEO weapon.\\n\\nAs we venture deeper into this digital realm, we discover the foundational architecture that supports this mighty empire. Ten numbered directories stretch before us like the chambers of a digital fortress:\\n\\n- **00_ACTIVE**: The beating heart of active projects and development work\\n- **01_TOOLS**: A treasure trove of utility scripts and automation tools\\n- **02_DOCUMENTATION**: The ancient scrolls containing wisdom and guidance\\n- **03_ARCHIVES**: Repositories of historical data and archived knowledge\\n- **04_WEBSITES**: The digital territories where online empires are built\\n- **05_DATA**: The vaults containing precious information and analytics\\n- **06_SEO_MARKETING**: The war room where search engine battles are planned\\n- **07_MISC**: The workshop where miscellaneous projects come to life\\n- **08_REPORTS**: The observatory where performance is measured and analyzed\\n- **09_SCRIPTS**: The scripting sanctum where automation magic is crafted\\n\\nEach directory holds secrets that will prove crucial to our mission. The path to top 1-5% rankings is not a simple one—it requires mastery of this entire ecosystem, understanding how each component interconnects to form an unstoppable force in the digital realm.\\n\\n## Chapter 2: The Discovery - Unveiling the Content-Awareness Intelligence System\\n\\nOur first major revelation comes as we encounter the Content-Awareness Intelligence System, the crown jewel of the AVATARARTS ecosystem. This system possesses an almost supernatural ability to understand code semantically, transcending the limitations of simple filename recognition. It reads through thousands of files, discerning meaning, purpose, and potential from the digital ether.\\n\\nThe system operates on principles that mirror the human mind's ability to comprehend context, but with the speed and precision of artificial intelligence. It examines each script, each function, each line of code not just for what it appears to be, but for what it truly represents in the grand scheme of digital operations.\\n\\nThrough this system, we learn that the 758+ Python scripts are not random collections of code, but carefully crafted tools designed for specific purposes:\\n\\n- **Instagram automation tools** that can engage with audiences at unprecedented scales\\n- **YouTube automation systems** that optimize content for maximum visibility\\n- **Social media management** scripts that maintain consistent presence across platforms\\n- **Content generation utilities** that create fresh, engaging material\\n- **Data processing scripts** that transform raw information into actionable insights\\n\\nEach script represents a potential weapon in our arsenal for achieving top 1-5% rankings. But weapons alone are not enough—we must understand how to wield them effectively within the broader strategy.\\n\\n## Chapter 3: The Revelation - Understanding Trend Analysis and Content Generation\\n\\nAs we delve deeper into the ecosystem, we discover the Trend Monitoring & Content Generation Pipeline, a sophisticated system that acts as our crystal ball for predicting digital trends. This pipeline operates on a principle that separates the successful from the forgotten: the ability to identify and capitalize on trends before they reach peak popularity.\\n\\nThe system operates through a daily ritual that begins at 9 AM, when the `hot_trending_content_engine.py` script awakens to scan the digital landscape for emerging opportunities. It seeks keywords with 200%+ growth, those rare gems that represent the next wave of search interest.\\n\\nThe primary trending keywords that emerge from this daily scanning become our targets for conquest:\\n\\n1. **AI Agent Automation** (+892% growth, 450K volume, $4.82 CPC)\\n2. **Sustainable Investing 2025** (+654% growth, 320K volume, $3.21 CPC)\\n3. **Remote Productivity Tools** (+543% growth, 890K volume, $2.89 CPC)\\n4. **Digital Wellness Apps** (+421% growth, 210K volume, $1.95 CPC)\\n5. **Small Business AI Tools** (+387% growth, 180K volume, $5.12 CPC)\\n\\nThese are not mere numbers—they represent millions of people searching for solutions, and we position ourselves to provide those solutions when demand reaches its peak.\\n\\nAt midday, the content generation process begins. The `trending_content_generator.py` script springs to life, transforming raw keyword data into SEO-optimized content that speaks directly to the needs and desires of searchers. This is where technical precision meets creative artistry, where algorithms understand not just what people are searching for, but why they are searching.\\n\\n## Chapter 4: The Fusion - Technical-Creative Synthesis\\n\\nOur journey reveals the most crucial element of the AVATARARTS approach: the seamless fusion of technical excellence with creative expression. This is not a marriage of convenience, but a perfect synthesis that creates content that performs exceptionally well in search engines while resonating deeply with human audiences.\\n\\nThe visual identity system exemplifies this fusion:\\n\\n- **Color Palette**: Neon Datagreen (#00FF9D) represents the digital flow of information, Oil Slick Black (#0F0F0F) embodies the mysterious depths of AI, and Error Red (#FF003D) signifies the passion for innovation\\n- **Typography**: Glitchbold font, a custom creation that merges circuit board patterns with artistic brush strokes\\n- **Iconography**: Toroidal data flows, TrashCat silhouettes, and Alchemical symbols that speak to both the technical and mystical aspects of AI\\n\\nThis visual language extends beyond aesthetics—it becomes a communication tool that signals to both search engines and users that this content represents something unique, something that transcends ordinary digital experiences.\\n\\nThe content creation process follows this fusion principle:\\n\\n1. **AI Generation**: Automated creation of SEO-optimized content with perfect keyword density and structure\\n2. **Human Curation**: Creative refinement that adds emotional resonance and artistic flair\\n3. **Technical Polish**: Performance optimization that ensures fast loading and excellent user experience\\n4. **Multi-Modal Output**: Content that works across text, images, video, and interactive elements\\n\\n## Chapter 5: The Strategy - Building the Path to Top 1-5% Rankings\\n\\nWith our understanding of the ecosystem complete, we now construct the comprehensive strategy that will guide us to top 1-5% rankings. This strategy operates on multiple levels simultaneously, creating a multi-dimensional approach to search engine supremacy.\\n\\n### The Scoring System\\n\\nOur success depends on achieving specific scores that place us in the top 1-5%:\\n\\n- **SEO Score**: 95+ (Top 1%)\\n- **AEO Score**: 90+ (Top 1%)\\n- **Combined Score**: 94+ (Top 1-5%)\\n\\nThe formula that governs our success is elegant in its simplicity:\\n```\\nCombined Score = (SEO Score × 0.6) + (AEO Score × 0.4)\\n```\\n\\nThis formula reflects the reality that traditional SEO remains slightly more important than Answer Engine Optimization, but both are crucial for achieving our goals.\\n\\n### The Daily Ritual\\n\\nOur strategy unfolds through a daily ritual that maximizes our chances of success:\\n\\n**Morning (9 AM)**: Trend discovery using the hot_trending_content_engine.py script\\n- Scans for keywords with 200%+ growth\\n- Identifies opportunities before competitors notice\\n- Sets the agenda for the day's content creation\\n\\n**Midday (12 PM)**: Content generation for top 3 trending topics\\n- Creates SEO-optimized content automatically\\n- Applies creative enhancement for human appeal\\n- Ensures perfect keyword density and structure\\n\\n**Afternoon (3-6 PM)**: Production and optimization\\n- Refines generated content for maximum impact\\n- Adds creative elements that differentiate from competitors\\n- Schedules for optimal timing based on audience analytics\\n\\n**Evening (6 PM)**: Publication and monitoring\\n- Releases content when audience engagement peaks\\n- Begins tracking performance metrics\\n- Prepares for the next day's activities\\n\\n## Chapter 6: The Templates - Crafting Content for Victory\\n\\nOur strategy includes five proven content templates that consistently achieve top 1-5% rankings:\\n\\n### Template 1: The Explainer\\n**Format**: \\\"What is [Trend]? | Why Everyone's Talking About This\\\"\\n- **Length**: 5-8 minutes of comprehensive education\\n- **Focus**: Educational value with practical applications\\n- **Best For**: Trends with low competition and high curiosity\\n\\n### Template 2: The Trend Analysis\\n**Format**: \\\"Why [Trend] Is BLOWING UP Right Now\\\"\\n- **Length**: 6-10 minutes of insightful analysis\\n- **Focus**: Predictive insights and market understanding\\n- **Best For**: Trends with medium competition and high interest\\n\\n### Template 3: The How-To Guide\\n**Format**: \\\"How to Use [Trend] | Complete Guide 2025\\\"\\n- **Length**: 8-12 minutes of step-by-step instruction\\n- **Focus**: Practical implementation and actionable steps\\n- **Best For**: Trends with high search volume and commercial intent\\n\\n### Template 4: The Comparison\\n**Format**: \\\"[Trend] vs [Alternative] | Which is Better?\\\"\\n- **Length**: 7-10 minutes of balanced analysis\\n- **Focus**: Pros and cons with clear recommendations\\n- **Best For**: Trends with established alternatives\\n\\n### Template 5: The Case Study\\n**Format**: \\\"I Tried [Trend] for 30 Days | Real Results\\\"\\n- **Length**: 10-15 minutes of authentic experience\\n- **Focus**: Real-world application and honest results\\n- **Best For**: Trends with social proof potential\\n\\nEach template follows strict SEO guidelines while maintaining the creative flair that distinguishes AVATARARTS content from generic, algorithmic output.\\n\\n## Chapter 7: The Advanced Tactics - Securing Our Dominance\\n\\nBeyond the basic strategy, we employ advanced tactics that create sustainable competitive advantages:\\n\\n### Trend Clustering Strategy\\nInstead of creating one piece of content per trend, we dominate entire keyword clusters by creating multiple related pieces:\\n- Main comprehensive guide\\n- Short-form content for specific aspects\\n- Playlist compilation for complete coverage\\n- This approach captures multiple search queries within the same trend\\n\\n### Early Mover Advantage\\nWe publish content within 24 hours of trend identification, securing first-mover advantage before competitors recognize the opportunity.\\n\\n### Multi-Platform Amplification\\nThe same core content is adapted for different platforms:\\n- YouTube: Full-length educational content\\n- Shorts: Highlight reels and key insights\\n- Twitter: Real-time updates and engagement\\n- LinkedIn: Professional insights and B2B content\\n\\n### Evergreen + Trending Mix\\nWe maintain 70% evergreen content for consistent performance and 30% trending content for viral potential, creating a balanced approach that delivers both stability and growth.\\n\\n## Chapter 8: The Measurement - Tracking Our Progress\\n\\nSuccess in the digital realm requires constant measurement and optimization. Our tracking system monitors multiple metrics simultaneously:\\n\\n### 30-Day Targets\\n- **Trend Discovery**: 20+ hot trends identified (75+ score)\\n- **Content Generation**: 5+ content packages created\\n- **Publications**: 3+ pieces of content published\\n- **Performance**: 50,000+ views from trending content\\n- **Rankings**: Top 3 position for 2+ keywords\\n- **Growth**: 500+ new subscribers\\n\\n### 90-Day Targets\\n- **Trend Discovery**: 60+ hot trends identified\\n- **Content Generation**: 15+ content packages created\\n- **Publications**: 10+ pieces of content published\\n- **Performance**: 200,000+ views from trending content\\n- **Rankings**: Top 3 position for 5+ keywords\\n- **Growth**: 2,000+ new subscribers\\n\\n### Revenue Targets\\n- **Month 1**: $200-500 from trending content\\n- **Month 3**: $1,000-2,500 from trending content\\n- **Authority**: Established as trend authority in niche\\n- **Revenue Streams**: Multiple activated simultaneously\\n\\n## Chapter 9: The Implementation - Bringing Theory to Life\\n\\nOur theoretical understanding transforms into practical action through a structured implementation timeline:\\n\\n### Week 1: Foundation\\n- Set up trend monitoring system with automated alerts\\n- Create content templates and optimization workflows\\n- Establish performance tracking and analytics\\n- Configure all necessary tools and platforms\\n\\n### Week 2: Content Generation\\n- Generate 5 trending content packages using AI tools\\n- Optimize each piece for target keywords and scores\\n- Create 3-5 initial pieces of high-quality content\\n- Test optimization effectiveness and adjust\\n\\n### Week 3: Publishing & Promotion\\n- Publish optimized content with perfect timing\\n- Implement cross-platform promotion strategy\\n- Monitor initial performance metrics closely\\n- Adjust strategy based on real-world results\\n\\n### Week 4: Scaling & Optimization\\n- Scale successful strategies across more keywords\\n- Optimize underperforming content for better results\\n- Expand to additional trending topics\\n- Prepare for the next implementation cycle\\n\\n## Chapter 10: The Mastery - Achieving Lasting Success\\n\\nOur journey toward top 1-5% rankings culminates in the achievement of lasting success through the perfect fusion of technical precision, creative excellence, and strategic implementation. The AVATARARTS ecosystem becomes not just a collection of tools, but a living system that continuously adapts, learns, and grows.\\n\\nThe critical success factors that ensure our victory include:\\n\\n1. **Speed**: Publishing within 24-48 hours of trend detection\\n2. **Quality**: Perfect SEO optimization combined with creative excellence\\n3. **Consistency**: Maintaining daily publishing and monitoring schedules\\n4. **Adaptability**: Adjusting strategies based on real-time performance data\\n5. **Innovation**: Continuously evolving our approach to stay ahead of competitors\\n\\nThe final result is not just top 1-5% rankings, but the establishment of a digital empire that generates sustainable revenue, builds lasting authority, and creates meaningful connections with audiences worldwide. Through the AVATARARTS ecosystem, we transform from content creators into digital alchemists, transmuting technical chaos into creative gold.\\n\\nThis journey represents more than a strategy—it embodies a philosophy of digital excellence where technology and creativity unite to achieve unprecedented success in the competitive landscape of search engine optimization. The path to top 1-5% rankings is challenging, but with the AVATARARTS ecosystem as our guide, it becomes not just possible, but inevitable.\",\"file_path\":\"/Users/steven/AVATARARTS/THE_JOURNEY_TO_DIGITAL_SUPREMACY.md\"}"

For example - save [llama.cpp](./docs/2.2.2-Backend&colon-llama.cpp.md) args for different models and contexts and switch between them easily.\n\n```bash\n# Save and use config profiles\nharbor profile save llama4\nharbor profile use default\n```\n\n#### Command History\n\nHarbor keeps a [local-only history of recent commands](./docs/3.-Harbor-CLI-Reference.md#harbor-history). Look up and re-run easily, standalone from the system shell history.\n\n```bash\n# Lookup recently used harbor commands\nharbor history\n```\n\n#### Eject\n\nReady to move to your own setup? Harbor [will give you](./docs/3.-Harbor-CLI-Reference.md#harbor-eject) a docker-compose file replicating your setup.\n\n```bash\n# Eject from Harbor into a standalone Docker Compose setup\n# Will export related services and variables into a standalone file.\nharbor eject searxng llamacpp > docker-compose.harbor.yml\n```\n\n---\n\n## Services\n\n##### UIs\n[Open

Later, [SearXNG](./2.3.1-Satellite:-SearXNG) is also started, and WebUI can connect to it for the Web RAG right out of the box. After that, [Harbor Boost](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost) is also started and connected to the WebUI automatically to induce more creative outputs. As a final step, Harbor config is adjusted in the App for the [`klmbr`](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost#klmbr---boost-llm-creativity) module in the [Harbor Boost](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost), which makes the output unparsable for the LLM (yet still undetstandable for humans).\n\n## Why?\n\n- If you're comfortable with Docker and Linux administration - you likely don't need Harbor to manage your local LLM environment. However, while growing it - you're also likely to eventually arrive to a similar solution. I know this for a fact, since that's exactly how Harbor came to be.\n- Harbor is not designed as a deployment solution, but rather as a helper for the local LLM development environment. It's a good starting point for experimenting with LLMs and related services.\n- Workflow/setup centralisation - you can be sure where to find a specific config or service, logs, data and configuration files.\n- Convenience factor - single CLI with a lot of services and features, accessible from anywhere on your host.\n\n## Supporters\n\n![@av's wife](https://ui-avatars.com/api/?size=32&name=KN&rounded=true&background=ffaaaa&color=ff4444)\n![@burnth3heretic](https://ui-avatars.com/api/?size=32&name=BTH&rounded=true)\nError: (none)\nExit Code: 0\nSignal: (none)\nBackground PIDs: (none)\nProcess Group PGID: (none)"

          "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- **folder-content-analyzer**: Use this agent when you need to research and analyze files within folders, understanding their logic, emotional tone, typography, and content context. This agent learns from each file and builds upon its understanding.\n- **general-purpose**: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n6. If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"code-reviewer\": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the with the code-reviewer agent \n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the with the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n- **folder-content-analyzer**: Use this agent when you need to research and analyze files within folders, understanding their logic, emotional tone, typography, and content context.

For these explicitly requested non-text files, their data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g., base64 encoded).\n\nThis tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of files, such as:\n- Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files in the 'src' directory).\n- Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad questions about code.\n- Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs' directory).\n- Gathering context from multiple configuration files.\n- When the user asks to \"read all files in X directory\" or \"show me the content of all Y files\".\n\nUse this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files, it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between file contents. The tool inserts a '--- End of content ---' after the last file. Ensure paths are relative to the target directory. Glob patterns like 'src/**/*.js' are supported. Avoid using for single files if a more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this tool.

If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n\n- Avoid using run_shell_command with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n  - File search: Use glob (NOT find or ls)\n  - Content search: Use grep_search (NOT grep or rg)\n  - Read files: Use read_file (NOT cat/head/tail)\n  - Edit files: Use edit (NOT sed/awk)\n  - Write files: Use write_file (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n  - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n- When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple run_shell_command tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two run_shell_command tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single run_shell_command call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before run_shell_command for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n- Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n  <good-example>\n  pytest /foo/bar/tests\n  </good-example>\n  <bad-example>\n  cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n  </bad-example>\n\n**Background vs Foreground Execution:**\n- You should decide whether commands should run in background or foreground based on their nature:\n- Use background execution (is_background: true) for:\n  - Long-running development servers: `npm run start`, `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `bun run start`\n  - Build watchers: `npm run watch`, `webpack --watch`\n  - Database servers: `mongod`, `mysql`, `redis-server`\n  - Web servers: `python -m http.server`, `php -S localhost:8000`\n  - Any command expected to run indefinitely until manually stopped\n\n  - Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n- Use foreground execution (is_background: false) for:\n  - One-time commands: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`\n  - Build commands: `npm run build`, `make`\n  - Installation commands: `npm install`, `pip install`\n  - Git operations: `git commit`, `git push`\n  - Test runs: `npm test`, `pytest`\n",

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n",
