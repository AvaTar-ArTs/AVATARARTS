## ?? Your Current State

### YOUR_SUNO_SONGS
**451 files** - Mix of:
- Your actual Suno music
- Video audio extracts
- Podcast content

### CSVs Created for Review
1. `~/Music/YOUR_SUNO_SONGS_COMPLETE.csv` - All 451 files
2. `~/Music/nocTurneMeLoDieS/COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.csv` - All 1,154 files
3. `~/Downloads/YOUR_SUNO_SONGS_COMPLETE - YOUR_SUNO_SONGS_COMPLETE.csv` - Your reference

### Suno Catalogs Found

## ?? Next Steps - YOUR Choice

### Option A: Manual Review (Recommended)
```bash
open ~/Music/YOUR_SUNO_SONGS_COMPLETE.csv
```

Review yourself, add `MY_TYPE` column, mark what each file is.
Then I'll create an executor based on YOUR decisions!

### Option B: Duration-Only Organization
Simple rule: Keep 30s-6min files, review the rest.
~362 files would be kept as "songs".

### Option C: Compare with Suno Catalog
Match your files against the 3,083-song Suno catalog.
Find which are actual Suno songs vs other content.

### Option D: Use Advanced Toolkit
Run the organizer and see what it suggests:
```bash
cd ~/advanced_toolkit
python suno_organizer.py scan
```
