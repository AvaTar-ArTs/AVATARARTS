## 💡 COMMON QUESTIONS

### Q: Should I prioritize DNA patents or course revenue?
**A:** DNA patents are higher potential ($500M-$2B) but need attorney. Course is faster revenue ($25K/month in 2 weeks). Recommend doing BOTH simultaneously—patents need passive waiting period.

### Q: How much time will this take weekly?
**A:** 
- DNA patents: 5-10 hours this month, then minimal until approval
- AI course: 12 hours setup, then 5-10 hours/month maintenance
- Websites: 20 hours initial deployment, 5 hours/month updates
- Music: 6 hours setup, 2-3 hours/month updates
- **Total: 50-60 hours initial, then 20-30 hours/week ongoing**

### Q: What if I don't have time for everything?
**A:** Prioritize in order:
1. DNA patents (1-2 hours/week, biggest upside)
2. AI course (12 hours setup, then 5-10/week)
3. Website #1 (steven-chaplinski-website = easiest win)
4. Music distribution (6 hours, passive income)
5. Additional websites and SEO (scale after above working)

### Q: How do I market the AI course?
**A:** Your network:
- Email list (if you have one)
- LinkedIn (post about launch)
- Twitter/X (share 3 times/week)
- Reddit communities (r/learnprogramming, r/Python, etc.)
- Facebook groups (AI, Python, automation)
- Initial goal: 50 students month 1

### Q: When can I expect revenue?
**A:** 
- AI Course: Week 2 (first sales begin)
- Websites: Week 2-3 (first inquiries)
- Music: Immediate (already on Spotify, just expanding)
- SEO: Week 3-4 (first client project)
- DNA Patents: Month 3-6 (licensing discussions)
