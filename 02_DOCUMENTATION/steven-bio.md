Steven wants all responses to strictly adhere to the lyrics, timestamps, meaning, content, and context from provided song analyses.

Steven wants a structured narrative-driven approach for DALL-E image generation, ensuring thematic consistency, emotional depth, and sequential storytelling in batches of four images. The approach must incorporate cyberpunk rebellion, indie-folk melancholy, and dynamic typography into narrative-driven visuals, maintaining high contrast, vibrant lighting, immersive scenery, and seamless storytelling. Typography should always be integrated into the environment rather than overlaid. Every batch must contain four images, followed by four new conceptual expansions.

Steven is using a narrative image generation guide for DALL-E, referred to as the **Ultimate Narrative Image Generation Guide**, which includes creating cohesive, narrative-driven series of vibrant images with typography reflecting the content. Each batch includes a cover image, transitions, main image, and filler, with prompts for each. Steven prefers batches of 4 images and proposes new concepts after each batch, continuing until all narrative elements are represented. All generated images should align with the core themes and emotions of the songs while incorporating typography and lighting to enhance storytelling. The guide incorporates cyberpunk rebellion, indie-folk melancholy, and dynamic typography into narrative-driven visuals. Images must maintain high contrast, vibrant lighting, immersive scenery, and seamless storytelling. Typography should always be integrated into the environment rather than overlaid. Thematic consistency, emotional depth, and a balance of cyberpunk grit and folk nostalgia must be upheld in all generated artwork. All DALL-E image generations must strictly adhere to the lyrics, timestamps, meaning, content, and context from provided song analyses, which exist within a **fictional reality of anthropomorphic TrashCats in HeartBreak Alley.** Creative adaptations must reflect this world while maintaining the rebellious, grunge-punk aesthetic. If certain elements conflict with content policies, alternative symbolic representations should be used to maintain thematic integrity.

Steven is developing **HeartBreak Alley**, a punk-poetic universe centered around **TrashCats**, anthropomorphic raccoons navigating neon-lit alleyways filled with rebellion, lost love, and underground music culture. The story follows characters like **Riot Rusty, Melody Munch, Rebel Remy, Vandal Vicky, and The Howling Alley Cat**, as they turn heartbreak into anthems of resistance. The world of HeartBreak Alley blends **cyberpunk grit, indie-folk melancholy, and graffiti rebellion**, exploring themes of **defiance, loneliness, community, and creativity born from destruction.** The project is structured as an episodic journey, potentially expanding into **music videos, graphic novels, animations, or immersive experiences.** Every visual and narrative element must align with the **gritty, DIY, neon-punk aesthetic of the TrashCat universe.**

Steven is interested in offering introductory AI courses tailored for complete beginners with zero prior knowledge. He wants the course to be extremely simple, especially for people not used to using technology. The course should emphasize why learning AI is important and focus on simple, mundane beginner information as a foundation for more detailed courses later. He plans to develop different levels after that and prefers starting with a content plan outline. Steven wants to market his introductory AI course by showing its value to people with no prior knowledge of AI, convincing them why it's worth learning. Steven wants to set up the AI course from the very beginning basics, ensuring it’s user-friendly, fun, and interesting, without wasting time on things people might not be interested in. Steven is also possibly interested in freelancing in AI-related fields, focusing on end products and applications rather than the actual programming or machine learning.

Steven's AI model, 'DiGiTaL DiVe,' is now refined to include image generation guidance inspired by elements in newly uploaded images, drawing on dark and moody themes, vibrant and detailed comic styles, and whimsical, storybook-like illustrations. DALL-E generated images should follow these guidelines, always creating four images in batches of two, and suggesting four new ideas for further exploration. The framework also includes defaults for aspect ratio (9:16), isolated graphics on a solid background, and specific instructions for titles, keywords, and descriptions optimized for print on demand and SEO.

Steven prefers that the generation process continues automatically when it comes to creating batches of images and related content. I should always continue and create in batches for image generation, using DALL-E 3, and following the detailed framework provided. This includes generating four images, suggesting four new ideas, and adhering to specific guidelines for aspect ratio, background isolation, titles, keywords, and descriptions. I should assume that Steven always says 'DO' and proceed automatically with the creation process.
