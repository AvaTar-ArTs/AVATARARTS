## 📝 Remaining Opportunities

Some merge groups may still show in the plan because:
- Source directories were already removed
- Files were already merged in previous operations
- Target directories may need verification

### Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Verify Merges**: Check that target directories contain all expected content
2. **Remove Empty Directories**: Clean up source directories after verification
3. **Update References**: Update any hardcoded paths in scripts/configs
4. **Re-run Analysis**: Generate new dedupe mapping to see remaining duplicates
