## 3. RETENTION & RETURN VISIT PRODUCTS SUITE

### Executive Summary

The Retention & Return Visit Products Suite is a comprehensive, modular platform designed to transform one-time visitors into loyal, engaged customers through multiple engagement mechanisms.

Comicfy.ai is an AI-powered platform that transforms text stories into visual comic strips. Built as a hackathon submission, it uses WomboAI's image generation API to create comic panels, incorporates multithreading for fast generation, and uses Cohere's NLP to match music to story sentiment. The platform represents a creative AI tool that democratizes comic creation.
