## What We Did for Your Practice

Think of your website like your practice's **digital business card** and **restaurant sign** combined. Just like how a well-placed, clear restaurant sign helps hungry customers find your establishment, we've optimized your website so that people searching for mental health services in Gainesville can easily find you online.

### The Problem We Solved

Before our work, your website was like having a restaurant with no sign, or a business card with tiny, hard-to-read text. When people searched for "psychiatrist in Gainesville" or "TMS therapy near me," your practice wasn't showing up where it should be. It's like having the best restaurant in town, but no one knows where to find it.

### The Solution We Implemented

We've transformed your online presence into a **professional, easily discoverable practice** that patients can find when they need help most.
