Steven's Documentation
======================

Welcome to Steven's comprehensive documentation system. This documentation covers two main directories:

- **tehSiTes**: A collection of web development projects, AI tools, SEO optimization scripts, and creative multimedia workflows
- **Documents**: Personal and professional documents, Python development projects, analysis reports, and creative content

This documentation provides an organized overview of the contents, structure, and purpose of files and directories within both source locations.
