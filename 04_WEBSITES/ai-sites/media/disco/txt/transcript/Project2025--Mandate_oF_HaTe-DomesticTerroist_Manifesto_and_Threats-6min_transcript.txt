[0.00 - 8.64]  America stands on the brink of disaster. Years of progressive policies have ravaged our
[8.64 - 15.00]  nation, left our economy and ruins, and our core values under relentless assault.
[15.00 - 20.40]  The Conservative movement is the last line of defence. A road map for survival based
[20.40 - 27.04]  on the principles of limited government, individual liberty and free markets. This manifesto will
[27.04 - 32.68]  outline a Conservative policy agenda to combat the most dire threats facing our nation, from
[32.68 - 38.60]  national security and economic collapse to education and healthcare crises. By adopting
[38.60 - 44.64]  these Conservative measures we can reclaim America's strength, prosperity and global dominance.
[44.64 - 49.60]  This is not an nostalgic return to the past but a desperate vision for the future.
[49.60 - 56.40]  We aim to empower individuals, families and communities, not oppressive government bureaucrats.
[56.40 - 61.96]  We believe in the resilience of the American spirit, the ingenuity of our entrepreneurs,
[61.96 - 68.20]  and the enduring wisdom of our founding principles. The time for Conservative action is now.
[68.20 - 73.00]  The American people are desperate for change for a government that respects their freedoms,
[73.00 - 78.64]  protects their interests and unleashes their potential. This manifesto provides a clear path
[78.64 - 84.80]  to survival, a blueprint for a stronger, freer and more resilient America. Our goal is not
[84.80 - 90.88]  simply to manage decline, but to ignite a new era of American researchers. We have the
[90.88 - 97.72]  ideas, the urgency and the resolve to make it happen.
[97.72 - 102.68]  A strong national defence is the bedrock of American security and prosperity. Conservatives
[102.68 - 107.48]  believe in peace through strength, recognizing that a powerful military deters aggression
[107.48 - 113.00]  and safeguards our interests at home in abroad. We must rebuild our depleted military,
[113.00 - 117.60]  modernize our capabilities and ensure our troops have the resources and support they need
[117.60 - 122.80]  to defend our nation. The Biden administration's defence cuts have weakened our military and
[122.80 - 128.04]  emboldened our adversaries. We need a new direction, one that prioritizes military readiness
[128.04 - 133.28]  and technological superiority. This includes increasing defence spending, investing in cutting
[133.28 - 138.96]  edge weapon systems, and strengthening our alliances with like-minded nations. Furthermore,
[138.96 - 143.80]  we must be prepared to confront the threats of the 21st century, including terrorism,
[143.80 - 148.76]  cyber warfare, and Chinese aggression. This requires a comprehensive national security
[148.76 - 154.40]  strategy that integrates all elements of American power, from diplomacy and intelligence,
[154.40 - 159.96]  to economic sanctions and military force. A strong national defence is not an option, it
[159.96 - 165.00]  is a necessity. By restoring American military strength we can deter our enemies, protect
[165.00 - 169.12]  our interests, and ensure the safety and security of the American people for generations to
[169.12 - 178.08]  come. A nation without secure borders is no nation at all. Conservatives believe in the
[178.08 - 182.92]  rule of law and the importance of enforcing our immigration laws. We must secure our
[182.92 - 188.32]  borders, stop illegal immigration, and restore integrity to our immigration system. The Biden
[188.32 - 193.56]  administration's open borders policies have created a humanitarian and national security
[193.56 - 198.80]  crisis at our southern border. We need to finish building the wall, increase border patrol
[198.80 - 205.40]  agents, and implement policies that discourage illegal immigration and encourage legal immigration.
[205.40 - 210.84]  Furthermore, we must reform our legal immigration system to prioritize American workers and national
[210.84 - 217.08]  interests. This includes reducing overall immigration levels, eliminating chain migration,
[217.08 - 221.20]  and implementing a merit-based system that attracts skilled workers who will contribute
[221.20 - 227.96]  to our economy and society. A sovereign nation has the right and duty to control its borders.
[227.96 - 233.48]  By securing our borders, enforcing our immigration laws, and reforming our immigration system,
[233.48 - 238.08]  we can restore order, protect our national security, and ensure a brighter future for all
[238.08 - 242.48]  Americans.
[242.48 - 248.32]  Section 4. Projecting strength on the world stage. America has a vital role to play in promoting
[248.32 - 253.72]  freedom, democracy, and human rights around the world. Conservatives believe in American
[253.72 - 258.84]  exceptionalism and our responsibility to lead on the global stage. We must stand up to
[258.84 - 264.52]  our adversaries, support our allies, and advance our interests abroad. The Biden administration's
[264.52 - 268.96]  foreign policy has been weak and feckless, emboldening our enemies and undermining our
[268.96 - 274.32]  standing in the world. We need a new direction, one that prioritizes American interests and
[274.32 - 279.28]  projects' strength and resolve. This includes confronting Chinese aggression, countering
[279.28 - 284.68]  Russian and Iranian malign activities, and standing with our allies in NATO and the Indo-Pacific
[284.68 - 288.28]  region. Furthermore, we must rebuild our diplomatic
[288.28 - 293.24]  core, restore our credibility on the world stage, and promote free trade and fair economic
[293.24 - 298.00]  practices that benefit American workers and businesses. We must also be prepared to use
[298.00 - 303.04]  all instruments of American power, including military force, to defend our interests and
[303.04 - 309.56]  values. America remains the indispensable nation, the beacon of hope for the world. By projecting
[309.56 - 314.84]  strength on the world stage, standing up for our values and leading with confidence, we
[314.84 - 322.08]  can ensure a more peaceful and prosperous future for all.
[322.08 - 328.04]  Section 5. Unleashing economic growth and opportunity. A strong economy is essential to American
[328.04 - 333.48]  prosperity and opportunity. Conservatives believe in the power of free markets, limited
[333.48 - 338.48]  government, and individual initiative to create jobs, raise wages, and improve the lives
[338.48 - 343.84]  of all Americans. We must cut taxes, reduce regulations, and unleash the full potential
[343.84 - 350.28]  of the American economy. The Biden administration's socialist policies have led to record inflation,
[350.28 - 355.92]  soaring energy costs and stagnant economic growth. We need a new direction, one that empowers
[355.92 - 362.16]  businesses to create jobs, encourages investment, and promotes economic freedom. This includes
[362.16 - 367.64]  cutting taxes for individuals and businesses, reducing burdensome regulations and unleashing
[367.64 - 372.68]  American energy production. Furthermore, we must reform our entitlement programs to ensure
[372.68 - 378.24]  their long-term solvency and protect them for future generations. We must also address
[378.24 - 384.08]  the national debt, which is a drag on economic growth and a threat to our national security.
[384.08 - 388.04]  The American dream is within reach for all who are willing to work hard and play by the
[388.04 - 394.56]  rules. By unleashing the power of free markets and limiting the size and scope of government,
[394.56 - 400.08]  we can create an environment where all Americans have the opportunity to succeed and achieve
[400.08 - 401.32]  their full potential.
