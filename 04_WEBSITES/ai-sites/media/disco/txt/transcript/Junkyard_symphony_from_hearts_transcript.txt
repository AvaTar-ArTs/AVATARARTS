[0.00 - 14.00]  In the junkyard where I clue Found some treasure, no one knew
[14.00 - 22.00]  Broken strings and rustic keys And keep the sound that trains for free
[22.00 - 28.00]  Old cancer metal thunks Turns at feet from scraps and junk
[28.00 - 36.00]  Hands on strings, beats drum and play Turned it trashed, cold each day
[36.00 - 42.00]  We made music from the rust Turns a nit spill from the dust
[42.00 - 50.00]  Sound of hope from broken parts Showed chest infamy from hearts
[50.00 - 58.00]  Neighbors gathered round to see Magic from our symphony
[58.00 - 66.00]  Hushing doubts with every note Making art from what they throw
[66.00 - 78.00]  Young cars symphony from hearts Reads awareness spread the word
[78.00 - 86.00]  Make the world more than you heard From the scraps of hopeless days
[86.00 - 93.00]  Build a tune brightly plays We made music from the rust
[93.00 - 100.00]  Turns a nit spill from the dust Sound of hope from broken parts
[100.00 - 114.00]  Showed chest infamy from hearts
[114.00 - 120.00]  Young cars symphony from hearts
[120.00 - 126.00]  Young cars symphony from hearts
[126.00 - 142.00]  Music
[142.00 - 150.00]  Neighbors gathered round to see Magic from our symphony
[150.00 - 160.00]  Hushing doubts with every note Making art from what they throw
[160.00 - 168.00]  Raised awareness spread the word Make the world more than you heard
[168.00 - 178.00]  From the scraps of hopeless days Build a tune brightly plays
[178.00 - 186.00]  Build a tune brightly plays Raised awareness spread the word
[186.00 - 192.00]  Make the world more than you heard
[192.00 - 200.00]  From the scraps of hopeless days Build a tune brightly plays
[200.00 - 206.00]  We made music from the rust
[206.00 - 218.00]  Young cars symphony from hearts
[218.00 - 232.00]  Young cars symphony from hearts
