[0.00 - 3.56]  The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS,
[3.56 - 7.96]  comes under particularly harsh scrutiny in Project 2025.
[7.96 - 12.56]  It's portrayed as a prime example of government overreach and inefficiency.
[12.56 - 14.96]  Critics point to its sprawling bureaucracy.
[14.96 - 16.96]  It's often confusing mandates,
[16.96 - 21.16]  and it's perceived failures in border security and immigration enforcement
[21.16 - 23.04]  as evidence of its dysfunction.
[23.04 - 27.92]  This critique, however, often ignores the complex realities of the department's mission
[27.92 - 33.84]  and the dedication of the thousands of individuals who work tirelessly to keep our country safe.
[33.84 - 37.04]  By painting DHS as a bureaucratic boondoggle,
[37.04 - 40.72]  Project 2025 seeks to weaken public support
[40.72 - 45.76]  for an agency that plays a vital role in protecting our nation from a wide array of threats.
