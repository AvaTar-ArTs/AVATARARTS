[0.00 - 6.40]  Project 2025, the 2025 presidential transition project is the conservative movement's unified
[6.40 - 12.40]  effort to be ready for the next conservative administration to govern at 12 noon, January 20,
[12.40 - 19.12]  2025. Welcome to the mission. In the winter of 1980, the Fledgling Heritage Foundation handed
[19.12 - 24.72]  to President-elect Ronald Reagan the inaugural mandate for leadership. This collective work
[24.72 - 29.92]  by conservative thought leaders and former government hands, most of whom were not part of heritage,
[29.92 - 35.36]  set out policy prescriptions, agency by agency for the incoming president. The book literally
[35.36 - 40.00]  put the conservative movement and Reagan on the same page, and the revolution that followed might
[40.00 - 48.56]  never have been, save for this band of committed and volunteer activists. It's not 1980. In 2023,
[48.56 - 54.40]  the game has changed. The long march of cultural Marxism through our institutions has come to pass.
[54.40 - 59.84]  The federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative values
[59.84 - 65.36]  with freedom and liberty under siege as never before. The task at hand to reverse this tide and
[65.36 - 70.64]  restore our republic to its original morings is too great for any one conservative policy shop
[70.64 - 75.44]  to spearhead. It requires the collective action of our movement. With the quickening approach of
[75.44 - 79.28]  January 2025, we have two years and one chance to get it right.
[80.08 - 86.56]  The project is built on four pillars. Pillar 1, this volume, puts in one place a consensus view
[86.56 - 91.84]  of how major federal agencies must be governed and where disagreement exists. Brackets out these
[91.84 - 96.96]  differences for the next president to choose a path. Pillar 2 is a personnel database that allows
[96.96 - 102.16]  candidates to build their own professional profiles and our coalition members to review and voice
[102.16 - 106.80]  their recommendations. These recommendations will then be collated and shared with the president
[106.80 - 112.32]  and Alex team, greatly streamlining the appointment process. Pillar 3 is the presidential
[112.32 - 118.00]  administration academy, an online educational system taught by experts from our coalition.
[118.00 - 123.36]  For the newcomer, this will explain how the government functions and how to function in government.
[123.36 - 128.72]  For the experienced, we will host in-person seminars with advanced training and set the bar for
[128.72 - 134.80]  what is expected of senior leadership. In Pillar 4, the playbook, we are forming agency teams in
[134.80 - 139.36]  drafting transition plans to move out upon the president's utterance of so help me God.
[142.00 - 147.12]  As Americans living at the approach of our nation's 250th birthday, we have been given much.
[147.12 - 153.12]  As conservatives we are as much required to steward this precious heritage for the next generation.
[153.12 - 157.76]  On behalf of our coalition partners, Paul Dan's Director Project 2025.
