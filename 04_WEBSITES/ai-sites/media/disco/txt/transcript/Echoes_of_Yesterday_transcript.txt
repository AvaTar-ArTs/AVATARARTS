[0.00 - 6.00]  Music
[6.00 - 11.00]  Shadows on the wall from flickering light
[11.00 - 16.00]  Spurring tales of all last fight
[16.00 - 19.00]  You left your ghost in every room
[19.00 - 23.00]  Loneliness in blue
[23.00 - 28.00]  Promise is like brittle leaves
[28.00 - 32.00]  Falling down from broken streets
[32.00 - 35.00]  A set of you still lingers here
[35.00 - 40.00]  Drowning in my tears
[40.00 - 45.00]  Loves gone cold, just empty space
[45.00 - 48.00]  Corp between heartaches and breaks
[48.00 - 52.00]  But from ashes I will rise
[52.00 - 56.00]  Find my own skies
[57.00 - 60.00]  Peace by peace on my soul
[60.00 - 64.00]  Gather strength to fill my home
[64.00 - 68.00]  The world outside is calling loud
[68.00 - 72.00]  Stand up from this shroud
[72.00 - 77.00]  Reflections in a shattered glass
[77.00 - 81.00]  Show me that this too shall pass
[81.00 - 84.00]  You are gone breaking on
[84.00 - 88.00]  See finally set free
[106.00 - 110.00]  Loves gone cold, just empty space
[110.00 - 113.00]  Corp between heartaches and breaks
[113.00 - 117.00]  But from ashes I will rise
[117.00 - 120.00]  Find my own skies
[143.00 - 150.00]  Peace by peace on my soul
[150.00 - 155.00]  Gather strength to fill my home
[155.00 - 159.00]  The world outside is calling loud
[159.00 - 163.00]  Stand up from this shroud
[163.00 - 168.00]  Reflections in a shattered glass
[168.00 - 172.00]  Show me that this too shall pass
[172.00 - 175.00]  You are gone breaking on the sea
[175.00 - 179.00]  Finally set free
[179.00 - 184.00]  Loves gone cold, just empty space
[184.00 - 188.00]  Corp between heartaches and breaks
[188.00 - 192.00]  But from ashes I will rise
[192.00 - 196.00]  Find my own skies
[196.00 - 200.00]  From ashes I will rise
[200.00 - 203.00]  Find my own skies
