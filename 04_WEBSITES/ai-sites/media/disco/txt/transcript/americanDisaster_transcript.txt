[0.00 - 7.76]  An American disaster. Project 2025. As America approaches its 250th anniversary.
[7.76 - 11.92]  The nation defines itself divided between two ideologies.
[11.92 - 17.68]  The enduring ideals of the American Revolution and the emerging woke revolutionaries.
[17.68 - 22.88]  The next administration's mission is clear. To champion American ideals,
[22.88 - 27.92]  support families, and preserve culture against these divisive forces.
[28.00 - 32.96]  The Constitution places executive power solely in the hands of the president.
[32.96 - 38.88]  This makes their agenda paramount across all departments and agencies.
[38.88 - 45.84]  However, the federal bureaucracy often operates independently, driven by its own ideologies,
[45.84 - 51.60]  rather than the will of the people. Within the bureaucracy, several challenges persist,
[51.60 - 57.52]  personnel issues abound, with irrational rules protecting underperforming employees,
[57.60 - 61.04]  and hindering the recruitment of qualified individuals.
[61.04 - 64.96]  Reform is essential to prioritize taxpayer interests.
[64.96 - 69.92]  Career employees dominate many agencies. The Trump administration appointed
[69.92 - 75.84]  fewer political appointees than previous administrations, leaving significant control
[75.84 - 82.56]  in the hands of career bureaucrats. This undermines the president's ability to implement their agenda,
[82.56 - 90.24]  despite its crucial role. OMB is often dominated by career employees, who obstruct political
[90.24 - 96.72]  appointees, a conservative administration must uphold the Constitution, and the rule of law,
[96.72 - 104.08]  resisting unconstitutional actions, and respecting the separation of powers between branches,
[104.08 - 110.80]  and the federal government, and these states. This meddling, decentralized administrative state,
[110.80 - 115.76]  is crucial for safeguarding freedom, empowering political appointees,
[115.76 - 122.08]  over unelected experts, will be a focus in the subsequent chapters. The departments of defense
[122.72 - 129.12]  and state are particularly vital for a successful presidency, due to their roles in national
[129.12 - 135.04]  defense, and foreign affairs. The Department of Defense faces significant challenges,
[135.60 - 142.00]  including a focus on leftist politics, over military readiness, recruitment difficulties due
[142.00 - 148.88]  to equity agendas, and vaccine mandates, a weakened defense industrial base, and a risk
[148.88 - 157.28]  of risk culture, despite these challenges, most enlisted personnel, and many officers remain patriotic.
[157.28 - 164.40]  Recommendations for improvement include prioritizing military readiness over social engineering,
[164.40 - 170.80]  increasing weapon manufacturing in America, reforming the budgeting process, and maintaining an
[170.80 - 177.44]  effective counter-terrorism enterprise. China poses the most significant danger, with its military
[177.44 - 184.24]  build-up and expansionist aims, requiring a denial-defense strategy to deter aggression.
[184.24 - 190.16]  Congressional approval for military actions is crucial, advocating a return to the founders
[190.16 - 197.20]  vision of Congress deciding on war, and the executive branch executing it. The State Department,
[197.20 - 203.20]  hampered by a left-leaning workforce, often opposes conservative policies. Strong political
[203.20 - 209.92]  leadership is essential. Foreign policy initiatives must take a more assertive stance against China,
[210.56 - 218.56]  focus on security, and economic issues in Africa, and avoid divisive symbols, like the rainbow flag,
[218.56 - 225.68]  or Black Lives Matter flag at embassies, the Department of Health, and Human Services HHS is a
[225.68 - 232.40]  major contributor to federal spending, with Medicare, and Medicaid significantly impacting the
[232.40 - 240.88]  national debt, the CDC, and NIH have faced criticism for their roles in COVID-19 policies,
[241.44 - 248.56]  particularly mask, and vaccine mandates, concerns about conflicts of interest, and reliance on
[248.56 - 255.36]  specific studies need addressing. The DOJ under the Biden administration is criticized for alleged
[255.36 - 262.72]  politicization, and weaponization. A return to its core functions is necessary, established during
[262.72 - 269.44]  the Carter administration. The ed is seen as out of touch, with parents' educational priorities,
[269.44 - 276.80]  control should return to states, and localities, focusing on parental concerns, and traditional
[276.80 - 283.92]  American ideals, recommendations extend to various departments, emphasizing energy independence,
[283.92 - 288.48]  reducing government intervention in agriculture, streamlining the EPA,
[289.20 - 295.44]  focusing HUD on core duties, shifting labor policies to pro-family, pro-worker agendas,
[295.44 - 302.16]  and prioritizing veterans' needs over bureaucratic interests. By implementing these recommendations,
[302.16 - 307.20]  the next conservative precedent can effectively restructure national security,
[307.20 - 313.60]  and foreign policy apparatus, reasserting America's role in the world, and prioritizing the needs
[313.60 - 321.60]  of the American people. This is the conservative promise for America's future, united. We can overcome
[321.60 - 325.12]  the challenges and preserve the ideals of our great nation.
