[0.00 - 3.00]  The left-faceted trash life
[3.00 - 6.00]  Rock cones in the neon light
[6.00 - 9.00]  Tops of fires blazing bright
[9.00 - 12.00]  Love is love, it's nothing right
[13.00 - 18.00]  Let's get trashy in the moonlight
[19.00 - 24.00]  By the dawn's stir fire so nice
[24.00 - 29.00]  Heartbreak out, we're where we hide
[30.00 - 34.00]  Watching lines in warning light
[40.00 - 42.00]  All fires and broken glass
[42.00 - 45.00]  Hashes whisper all of us cast
[45.00 - 48.00]  In the salary of all rats
[48.00 - 51.00]  Tops of hearts beat fast, fast, fast
[52.00 - 57.00]  Let's get trashy in the moonlight
[58.00 - 63.00]  By the dawn's stir fire so nice
[63.00 - 68.00]  Heartbreak out, we're where we hide
[69.00 - 73.00]  Watching lines in warning light
[78.00 - 81.00]  The left-faceted trash dreams
[81.00 - 84.00]  Crushed cardboard and paper scene
[84.00 - 86.00]  Still all the shattered veins
[86.00 - 90.00]  Record hearts in moonlight skin
[95.00 - 98.00]  Team hands clanking whispered vows
[100.00 - 104.00]  In the night, alley crowds
[106.00 - 109.00]  Trash cow lovers take their bow
[110.00 - 116.00]  In the darkness where we hide
[133.00 - 136.00]  All fires and broken glass
[137.00 - 139.00]  Hashes whisper all of us cast
[139.00 - 142.00]  In the salary of all rats
[142.00 - 145.00]  Tops of hearts beat fast, fast, fast
[145.00 - 148.00]  Look at all the entire dreams
[148.00 - 151.00]  Crushed cardboard and paper scene
[151.00 - 153.00]  Still all the shattered veins
[153.00 - 156.00]  Record hearts in moonlight skin
[156.00 - 159.00]  Can't click and whispered vows
[161.00 - 165.00]  In the midnight, alley crowds
[166.00 - 169.00]  Crushed cow lovers take their bow
[171.00 - 175.00]  In the darkness where we hide
