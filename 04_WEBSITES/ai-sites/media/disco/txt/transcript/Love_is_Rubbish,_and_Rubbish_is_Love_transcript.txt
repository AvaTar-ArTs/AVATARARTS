[0.00 - 15.00]  I'm not a bad guy, I'm not a pearl, but a cracked old stone.
[15.00 - 20.00]  You wander through the trash, make this mess our room.
[20.00 - 25.00]  By the dumpster fire, found a spark of light,
[25.00 - 31.00]  in the ruins of the day you became my knight.
[31.00 - 36.00]  Torn up boots, dancing on the cracked oak streets,
[36.00 - 41.00]  in the heart of the grind, all broken hearts meet.
[41.00 - 46.00]  Jagged edges fit like puzzle pieces worn,
[46.00 - 52.00]  from the chaos and clutter, a new love born,
[52.00 - 57.00]  love is rubbish and rubbish is love.
[57.00 - 62.00]  In the scraps of this world we find our above,
[62.00 - 67.00]  a table of the broken, a harmony tough,
[67.00 - 73.00]  love is rubbish and rubbish is love.
[73.00 - 78.00]  Good feeding walls whispered tales of the past,
[78.00 - 83.00]  in the wreckage of our dreams we built something that lasts.
[83.00 - 88.00]  Your eyes are beginning to disarray,
[88.00 - 95.00]  even the rubbish we found our way.
[95.00 - 102.00]  Rust and rubble, no polish in the imperfections,
[102.00 - 105.00]  we create the scene.
[105.00 - 110.00]  A symphony of flaws, a love unforeseen,
[110.00 - 115.00]  in the heart of the trash, with beauty in between.
[115.00 - 120.00]  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love.
[120.00 - 125.00]  In the patches and the pieces we rise above,
[125.00 - 131.00]  a mosaic of the shadowed lines rough.
[131.00 - 136.00]  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love.
[161.00 - 163.00]  No!
