[0.00 - 7.80]  I'm a threat guy, he's so so white
[7.80 - 10.40]  That's the rabbit sight by sight
[10.40 - 13.00]  We live fast, we're done as white
[13.00 - 15.60]  In our dreams on a street life's night
[15.60 - 18.20]  Just get froze without so pride
[18.20 - 20.80]  Under the oven on the night
[20.80 - 23.20]  Gold in our shoes of guiding light
[23.20 - 26.20]  We chase the clues, we don't do right
[26.40 - 28.80]  Live fast, eat fast
[28.80 - 31.40]  We'll put it blind and we ask
[31.40 - 33.80]  Live fast, eat fast
[33.80 - 36.60]  Farming in treasures in the flesh
[36.60 - 39.00]  So we walk this out of your way
[39.00 - 41.60]  Hearts on streets, we're spirits grey
[41.60 - 44.20]  That's the cradle to win a race day
[44.20 - 46.80]  In his life, prepared to win
[46.80 - 49.40]  Broken bottle stories told
[49.40 - 51.80]  That's the rappers worth their gold
[51.80 - 54.60]  In our break out here we are bold
[54.60 - 57.60]  Young and wild, watch us unfold
[57.60 - 60.00]  Live fast, eat trash
[60.00 - 62.80]  We'll put it blind and we ask
[62.80 - 65.00]  Live fast, eat trash
[65.00 - 68.00]  Farming in treasures in the flesh
[78.40 - 80.80]  Live fast, eat trash
[80.80 - 83.40]  We'll put it blind and we ask
[83.40 - 85.80]  Live fast, eat trash
[85.80 - 88.60]  Farming in treasures in the flesh
[88.60 - 90.80]  So we walk this out of your way
[90.80 - 93.60]  Hearts on streets, we're spirits grey
[93.60 - 96.00]  That's the cradle to win a race day
[96.00 - 98.80]  In his life, prepared to win
