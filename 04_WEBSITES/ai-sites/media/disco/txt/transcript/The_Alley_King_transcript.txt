[0.00 - 2.00]  Mmm...
[2.00 - 4.00]  Mmm...
[4.00 - 6.00]  Mmm...
[6.00 - 8.00]  Mmm...
[8.00 - 10.00]  Mmm...
[10.00 - 12.00]  Mmm...
[12.00 - 16.00]  Once the king of this place called the Ily
[16.00 - 22.00]  Samy ruled with his two and his rally
[22.00 - 28.00]  But a holland kite came and stole his throne
[28.00 - 34.00]  Now sadly sings his blues all along
[34.00 - 38.00]  And the moonlight he strums with sadness
[38.00 - 40.00]  Sadness...
[40.00 - 44.00]  A coast bounce off the walls of his madness
[44.00 - 46.00]  Madness...
[46.00 - 50.00]  Every note from his heart always true
[50.00 - 54.00]  And the shadows he fights with the blue
[54.00 - 58.00]  Oh Samy once the Ily King
[58.00 - 64.00]  Now his chords just cry and sting with every whisper of his strength
[64.00 - 66.00]  He drinks of the days he used to sing
[66.00 - 70.00]  On the corner where the street light flickers
[70.00 - 72.00]  Flickers...
[72.00 - 76.00]  He remembers when his fate was thicker
[76.00 - 78.00]  Oh, sticker...
[78.00 - 82.00]  But the holland kites got a brand new show
[82.00 - 88.00]  And now Samy's sorrow starts to flow
[88.00 - 94.00]  Heart breaks the beat that he now knows
[94.00 - 98.00]  The fire's burns where his music grows
[98.00 - 104.00]  Where his music he won't give up his Ily way
[104.00 - 106.00]  Ily...
[106.00 - 110.00]  Because in his soul the fire stays
[110.00 - 114.00]  Oh Samy once the Ily King
[114.00 - 120.00]  Now his chords just cry and sting with every whisper of his strength
[120.00 - 124.00]  He drinks of the days he used to sing
[124.00 - 128.00]  Oh Samy once the Ily King
[128.00 - 132.00]  Now his chords just cry and sting with every whisper of his strength
[132.00 - 136.00]  He drinks of the days he used to sing
[136.00 - 141.00]  And he was the alligator, now his corpse is caught in strife
[141.00 - 144.00]  With every whisper of a strain
[144.00 - 148.00]  He'd be beaten on the days he used to sing
[149.00 - 151.00]  He used to sing
[152.00 - 155.00]  Or praise the boo
