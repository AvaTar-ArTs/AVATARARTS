[0.00 - 5.58]  Under the neon flicker moonlight scatters
[5.58 - 10.42]  Reconstream broken glass shattered
[10.42 - 12.66]  Diving and dumpsters
[12.66 - 15.10]  Loves a dirty game
[15.10 - 18.40]  Heartbreak alley ain't nothing tame
[20.90 - 25.30]  Whiskey rains falling, love left behind
[26.02 - 30.90]  Dunks to fires, where broken hearts bind
[30.90 - 35.42]  Junkyard kings with their empty cans
[35.42 - 39.82]  Whisper's a love very incense
[39.82 - 45.46]  Blue fats, here's our trash
[45.46 - 48.06]  Throom lights promise
[48.06 - 51.62]  Gone in a flash party hours
[51.62 - 54.90]  Thoth of fires cycle
[54.90 - 59.62]  In the rubble where wild dreams go
[63.94 - 68.74]  Rusty echoes of the midnight bend
[68.74 - 73.78]  Scaven treasures in our outstretched hand
[73.78 - 77.78]  Siggered smoke mingles with the stars
[77.78 - 81.94]  In a world of clutter nothing's gone too far
[84.18 - 88.82]  Inside tales wrapped in old newspaper
[88.82 - 93.78]  Loves graffiti scribble by a paper
[93.78 - 98.10]  Broken hearts singing love of bines
[98.10 - 102.74]  In the dumpsters we'll all slow the lines
[103.06 - 107.54]  Blue fats, here's our trash
[108.66 - 111.14]  Throom lights promise
[111.14 - 114.66]  Gone in a flash party hours
[114.66 - 118.02]  Thoth of fires cycle
[118.02 - 122.74]  In the rubble where wild dreams go
[122.74 - 124.74]  Rusty echoes of the midnight bend
[124.74 - 128.74]  Scaven treasures in our outstretched hand
[128.74 - 132.74]  Siggered smoke mingles with the stars
[132.74 - 137.62]  In a world of clutter nothing's gone too far
[137.62 - 139.62]  The midnight bend
[139.62 - 143.62]  Scaven treasures in our outstretched hand
[143.62 - 147.62]  Siggered smoke mingles with the stars
[147.62 - 151.62]  In a world of clutter nothing's gone too far
