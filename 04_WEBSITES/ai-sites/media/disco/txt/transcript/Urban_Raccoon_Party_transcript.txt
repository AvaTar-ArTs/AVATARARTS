[0.00 - 11.20]  In the sea for the lights, there's a night, never-and-this-brought cruise and party house.
[11.20 - 18.36]  Breaking all the trends, trash cans lying in the alley, urban jungle graffiti walls, dancing
[18.36 - 25.40]  in the moonlight, answering the why you'll call.
[25.40 - 30.24]  Urban rat cool and party, pumping in the stars,
[30.24 - 36.00]  Rubin' in the shadows, you know who we are.
[36.00 - 40.24]  Heats across an old fri-turning waste of gold,
[40.24 - 44.96]  Street feeds and neon drinks, watch the night unfold.
[44.96 - 50.12]  Eyes shining, life steals, we party till the dawn,
[50.12 - 57.12]  There's no rules, no deals, in this urban song.
[58.40 - 62.76]  Seas, hearts are jumbled, where raccoons roll the night,
[62.76 - 69.76]  Street lamps are the brothers, with dance till morning lights.
[69.76 - 89.72]  Urban rat cool party, underneath the stars,
[89.72 - 95.00]  Rubin' in the shadows, you know who we are.
[95.00 - 102.00]  Heats across an old fri-turning waste of gold,
[102.00 - 109.00]  Street feeds and neon drinks, watch the night unfold.
[109.00 - 113.00]  Heats across an old fri-turning waste of gold,
[113.00 - 118.00]  Street feeds and neon drinks, watch the night unfold.
[118.00 - 122.00]  Eyes shining, life steals, we party till the dawn,
[123.00 - 127.00]  There's no rules, no deals, in this urban song.
[127.00 - 131.00]  Seas, hearts are jumbled, where raccoons roll the night,
[131.00 - 136.00]  Street lamps are the brothers, with dance till morning lights.
[136.00 - 140.00]  Eyes shining, life steals, we party till the dawn,
[140.00 - 145.00]  There's no rules, no deals, in this urban song.
[145.00 - 150.00]  Seas, hearts are jumbled, where raccoons roll the night,
[150.00 - 156.00]  Street lamps are the brothers, with dance till morning lights.
[181.00 - 187.00]  Urban rat cool party, underneath the stars,
[187.00 - 192.00]  Rubin' in the shadows, you know who we are.
[192.00 - 198.00]  Heats across an old fri-turning waste of gold,
[198.00 - 203.00]  Street feeds and neon drinks, watch the night unfold.
[203.00 - 207.00]  Heats across an old fri-turning waste of gold,
[207.00 - 211.00]  Seas, hearts are jumbled, where raccoons roll the night,
[211.00 - 215.00]  Street lamps are the brothers, with dance till morning lights.
[215.00 - 219.00]  Eyes shining, life steals, we party till the dawn,
[219.00 - 224.00]  There's no rules, no deals, in this urban song.
[224.00 - 228.00]  No you go the night, street lamps are the brothers,
[228.00 - 232.00]  We dance till morning lights.
[232.00 - 236.00]  No you go the night, street lamps are the brothers,
[236.00 - 239.00]  We dance till morning lights.
