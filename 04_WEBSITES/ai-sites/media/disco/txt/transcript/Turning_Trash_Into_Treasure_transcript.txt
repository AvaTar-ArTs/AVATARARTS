[0.00 - 3.00]  Waste and a harsh alley's heart play
[3.00 - 7.00]  Cali nights Rusty love to survive
[7.00 - 9.00]  Having you for the life
[9.00 - 11.00]  Witness leaders corrupt you
[11.00 - 14.00]  So then turn hearts to stone
[14.00 - 17.00]  Rusty kept on walking
[17.00 - 21.00]  His spirit never alone
[21.00 - 25.00]  Turning trash into treasure
[25.00 - 28.00]  Rebellion in his eyes
[31.00 - 34.00]  Rusty shines through the pressure
[34.00 - 37.00]  In the alley where hope flies
[41.00 - 43.00]  Dark nights no longer scared him
[43.00 - 46.00]  His fire burning bright
[46.00 - 49.00]  Lusty forging a kingdom
[49.00 - 52.00]  From the shards of the fight
[52.00 - 54.00]  Horses, whispers in the shadows
[54.00 - 57.00]  Secrets in every crack
[57.00 - 59.00]  Rusty on with his wisdom
[59.00 - 62.00]  He's never looking back
[62.00 - 66.00]  Turning trash into treasure
[66.00 - 71.00]  Rebellion in his eyes
[71.00 - 75.00]  Rusty shines through the pressure
[75.00 - 79.00]  In the alley where hope flies
[87.00 - 94.00]  Dark nights no longer scared him
[94.00 - 106.00]  His fire burning bright
[106.00 - 111.00]  Rusty forging a kingdom
[111.00 - 116.00]  From the shards of the fight
[116.00 - 120.00]  Horses, whispers in the shadows
[120.00 - 124.00]  Secrets in every crack
[124.00 - 129.00]  Rusty on with his wisdom
[129.00 - 134.00]  He's never looking back
[134.00 - 137.00]  Turning trash into treasure
[137.00 - 141.00]  Rebellion in his eyes
[141.00 - 145.00]  Rusty shines through the pressure
[145.00 - 152.00]  In the alley where hope flies
