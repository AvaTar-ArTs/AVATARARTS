[0.00 - 17.00]  In a junkyard way, dreams lie, found my home under the sky.
[17.00 - 28.00]  Rusty tunes echo the past, music born from things that last.
[28.00 - 39.00]  Drone for dreams, oh can't you see junkyards and for me?
[39.00 - 50.00]  Strings from wire drums from cans, harmony and dusty plants.
[50.00 - 59.00]  Defeather pearls came to claim, but we played to save our name.
[59.00 - 78.00]  Fight for dreams, oh can't you see junkyards and for me?
[79.00 - 90.00]  Strings from wire drums from cans, harmony and dusty plants.
[90.00 - 100.00]  Defeather pearls came to claim, but we played to save our name.
[100.00 - 110.00]  Fight for dreams, oh can't you see junkyards and for me?
[130.00 - 140.00]  Strings from wire drums from cans, harmony and dusty plants.
