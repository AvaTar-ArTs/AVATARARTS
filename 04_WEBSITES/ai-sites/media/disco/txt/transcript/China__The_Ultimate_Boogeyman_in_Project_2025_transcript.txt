[0.00 - 4.24]  Central to the World View, espoused by Project 2025,
[4.24 - 7.44]  is the portrayal of China as an existential threat
[7.44 - 9.36]  to the United States.
[9.36 - 11.84]  China is not just an economic competitor,
[11.84 - 14.52]  it is portrayed as a looming, demonic force
[14.52 - 16.84]  bent on world domination.
[16.84 - 20.04]  This narrative casts China as the ultimate boogie man,
[20.04 - 22.84]  justifying a more aggressive and often bellicose
[22.84 - 24.12]  foreign policy.
[24.12 - 27.84]  Trade wars, military buildups, and technological competition
[27.84 - 30.28]  become not just necessary precautions,
[30.28 - 33.12]  but essential tools in a fight for survival.
[33.12 - 35.88]  This fear-mongering serves a dual purpose.
[35.88 - 38.52]  First, it distracts from domestic issues
[38.52 - 41.44]  and unifies the population against a common enemy.
[41.44 - 43.88]  Second, it justifies policies that would otherwise
[43.88 - 45.28]  be seen as extreme.
