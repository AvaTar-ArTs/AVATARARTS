[0.08 - 19.66]  That was 사람, who directed and it wasn't too used
[19.66 - 23.90]  You know, dropping like the windway
[23.90 - 30.90]  Echoes ring through island bones Made a stage out of old stones
[30.90 - 44.90]  In the junkyard I find Songs that free my mind
[45.90 - 53.90]  Raise a voice so clear Turn and trust to cheer
[57.90 - 65.90]  In the junkyard I find Songs that free my mind
[66.90 - 73.90]  Raise a voice so clear Turn and trust to cheer
[75.90 - 80.90]  Crazy gears and metal sheets Melonies from old seats
[80.90 - 85.90]  Every note a burst hope For our planet we can cope
[85.90 - 90.90]  Made a beat from rock singing and the world never fails
[90.90 - 97.90]  To listen to our humble band Music born from every hand
[97.90 - 106.90]  In the junkyard I find Songs that free my mind
[106.90 - 115.90]  Raise a voice so clear Turn and trust to cheer
[116.90 - 126.90]  In the junkyard I find Songs that free my mind
[126.90 - 134.90]  Raise a voice so clear Turn and trust to cheer
