[0.00 - 3.56]  Section 8, the Fog of Disinformation.
[3.56 - 6.40]  In the ecosystem of Project 2025,
[6.40 - 9.44]  the traditional media is often painted as complicit
[9.44 - 11.96]  in the decline of American values.
[11.96 - 13.92]  Journalists are accused of bias,
[13.92 - 15.72]  of pushing a liberal agenda,
[15.72 - 18.72]  and of actively suppressing conservative voices.
[18.72 - 21.04]  This distrust of traditional news sources
[21.04 - 24.12]  is further fueled by the proliferation of misinformation
[24.12 - 26.24]  and disinformation online.
[26.24 - 29.20]  Social media platforms, with their algorithms designed
[29.20 - 31.56]  to amplify engagement rather than truth,
[31.56 - 34.00]  have become fertile ground for the spread of propaganda
[34.00 - 35.72]  and conspiracy theories.
[35.72 - 38.08]  This creates a dangerous feedback loop,
[38.08 - 40.64]  where people are increasingly exposed to information
[40.64 - 42.40]  that confirms their existing biases
[42.40 - 44.04]  regardless of its veracity.
