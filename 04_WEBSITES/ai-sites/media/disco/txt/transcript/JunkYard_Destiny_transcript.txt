[30.00 - 35.64]  And you're in the night from the trash to harmony I found my life
[35.64 - 43.28]  Turn your destiny, nothing safe like in the chaos I see
[43.28 - 45.48]  Melodies to light
[48.48 - 53.48]  Wasting up the voices, buried deep in piles of waste
[53.48 - 57.36]  Show them all their choices, cricketing with some peace
[57.36 - 62.04]  How magic in the clutter and the bottom of all bins
[62.04 - 66.92]  Horses begin to flutter when the symphony begins
[66.92 - 71.52]  Disguided dreams we find, turning pain into song
[71.52 - 77.72]  In every beat and crime we know where we belong
[87.48 - 89.48]  Oh
[100.16 - 104.60]  Chunk your symphony
[104.60 - 110.00]  Echo in the night from the trash to harmony I found my life
[110.00 - 117.32]  Chunk your destiny, nothing safe like in the chaos I see
[117.76 - 125.00]  Melodies to light, wasting up the voices, buried deep in piles of waste
[126.00 - 131.52]  Show them all their choices, cricketing with some peace
[131.52 - 136.12]  How magic in the clutter and the bottom of all bins
[136.12 - 138.72]  Horses begin to flutter when the symphony begins
[138.72 - 141.20]  Melodies to light
[143.16 - 145.48]  Melodies to light
[148.32 - 153.00]  Wasting up the voices, buried deep in piles of waste
[153.00 - 157.12]  Show them all their choices, cricketing with some peace
[157.12 - 161.64]  Found magic in the clutter and the bottom of all bins
[161.64 - 166.24]  Horses begin to flutter when the symphony begins
[166.24 - 170.96]  Disguided dreams we find, turning pain into song
[170.96 - 177.16]  In every beat and crime we know where we belong
[177.68 - 179.68]  Oh
[179.68 - 187.32]  Disguided dreams we find, turning pain into song
[187.32 - 195.96]  In every beat and crime we know where we belong
[195.96 - 200.60]  We know where we belong
[200.60 - 205.00]  We know where we belong
[206.00 - 209.00]  We know where we belong
[210.00 - 213.00]  We know where we belong
