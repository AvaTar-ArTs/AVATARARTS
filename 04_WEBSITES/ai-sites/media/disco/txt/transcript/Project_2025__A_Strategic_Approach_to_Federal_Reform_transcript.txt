[0.00 - 4.80]  Project 2025 recognizes the need for a strategic approach.
[4.80 - 9.64]  It acknowledges that simply dismantling government agencies is not enough.
[9.64 - 13.40]  Instead, it calls for a comprehensive strategy of reform,
[13.40 - 15.64]  replacement, and renewal.
[15.64 - 19.96]  This means identifying programs that are ineffective or redundant.
[19.96 - 24.36]  It also means empowering agencies that uphold the constitution
[24.36 - 26.84]  and serve the American people.
[26.84 - 31.08]  This approach requires a deep understanding of how the federal government operates.
[31.08 - 35.28]  It demands a commitment to finding practical, workable solutions.
