[0.00 - 16.00]  With rock-o'-n band and narrowly lights Love ballets soft and the dark Till one night love left them on
[16.00 - 31.00]  Holding cat took Sammy's throne Winning contest all alone
[31.00 - 39.00]  Sammy's heart was torn into music now laced with blues
[39.00 - 52.00]  Oh Sammy, why oh why Did the alley cat steal your scar? Once you sang love love and life
[52.00 - 59.00]  Now your song's biting the night
[59.00 - 67.00]  Rekoon band plays out of tune Since that faithful night in June
[67.00 - 76.00]  Howling cat's song took the crowd Left poor Sammy crying love
[76.00 - 84.00]  Rekoon band plays out of tune Since that faithful night in June
[85.00 - 93.00]  Howling cat's song took the crowd Left poor Sammy crying love
[93.00 - 102.00]  Sammy's tunes have lost their play Heartbreak thunder the willow tree
[102.00 - 110.00]  Ballets now with teeth and claws Rekoon's play with hidden flaws
[110.00 - 118.00]  Oh let alley still remember Songs of love in soft September
[118.00 - 127.00]  Sammy sings with ferrous pipe Turning love into fire
[140.00 - 154.00]  Oh let alley still remember Songs of love in soft September
[154.00 - 163.00]  Sammy sings with ferrous pipe Turning love into fire
[163.00 - 180.00]  Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[193.00 - 217.00]  Oh let alley still remember Songs of love in soft September
[217.00 - 226.00]  Sammy sings with ferrous pipe Turning love into fire
