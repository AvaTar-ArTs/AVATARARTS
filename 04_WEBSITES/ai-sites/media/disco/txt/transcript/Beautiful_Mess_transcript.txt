[0.00 - 6.44]  Rusty chains tangled around the broken swing
[6.44 - 10.28]  And in the lion blooms where the thorns clean
[10.28 - 14.08]  Scratched up records play the same set song
[14.08 - 21.56]  We danced in shadows where we both belong
[21.56 - 25.36]  Graffiti hearts on the crumbling walls
[25.36 - 29.24]  Faded vows and spray paint squalbs
[29.24 - 32.92]  In the cluttered streets we found our place
[32.92 - 37.08]  Embracing flaws and lovers' grace
[37.08 - 43.48]  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive
[43.48 - 47.24]  And chips painted neon lights
[47.24 - 53.72]  We come alive loving and perfection a story so old
[53.76 - 58.36]  In our disarray we found gold
[73.00 - 76.84]  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
[76.84 - 82.44]  Lost in the echoes of the broken past your wildlife
[82.60 - 86.44]  My silent cry in our barked water world
[86.44 - 92.36]  We touched the sky among the wreckage flowers grow
[92.36 - 95.96]  Midter sweet love all we know
[95.96 - 99.80]  In the disarray hearts beating fast
[99.80 - 103.64]  A beautiful mess our love to last
[103.64 - 108.28]  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive
[108.28 - 112.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[112.12 - 118.60]  We come alive loving and perfection a story so old
[118.60 - 123.08]  In our disarray we found gold
[142.12 - 147.00]  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
[147.00 - 151.00]  Lost in the echoes of the broken past your wildlife
[151.00 - 155.24]  And chips painted neon lights
[155.24 - 160.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[160.12 - 164.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[164.12 - 168.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[168.12 - 172.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[172.12 - 176.12]  And chips painted neon lights
[176.12 - 180.12]  And chips painted neon lights
