[0.00 - 7.00]  Rusty chains tangled round the broken swim
[7.00 - 14.00]  The dandelion blooms where the thorns cling
[14.00 - 18.00]  Scratched up records play the same sad song
[18.00 - 24.00]  We danced in shadows where we both belong
[30.00 - 40.00]  Graffiti hearts on the crumbling walls
[40.00 - 45.00]  Faded thousands, sprayed paint scrolls
[45.00 - 50.00]  In the cluttered streets we found our place
[50.00 - 57.00]  Embracing flaws in a lover's grace
[61.00 - 67.00]  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive
[67.00 - 74.00]  Inchip paints and neon lights we come alive
[74.00 - 83.00]  Loving imperfection, a story so old and our disarray
[83.00 - 88.00]  We found gold
[88.00 - 92.00]  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
[92.00 - 96.00]  Lost in the echoes of a broken past
[96.00 - 101.00]  Your wild laugh my silent cry
[101.00 - 105.00]  In our barred wide world we touched the sky
[105.00 - 109.00]  Among the wreckage flowers grow
[109.00 - 114.00]  Bittersweet love all we know
[114.00 - 118.00]  In the disarray hearts beating fast
[118.00 - 125.00]  A beautiful mess our love to life
[125.00 - 131.00]  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive
[131.00 - 138.00]  Inchip paints and neon lights we come alive
[138.00 - 147.00]  Loving imperfection, a story so old and our disarray
[147.00 - 152.00]  We found gold
[152.00 - 158.00]  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive
[158.00 - 165.00]  Inchip paints and neon lights we come alive
[165.00 - 174.00]  Loving imperfection, a story so old and our disarray
[174.00 - 179.00]  We found gold
[195.00 - 201.00]  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
