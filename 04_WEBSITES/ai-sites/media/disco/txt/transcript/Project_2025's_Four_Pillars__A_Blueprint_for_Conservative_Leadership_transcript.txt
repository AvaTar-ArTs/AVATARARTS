[0.00 - 2.00]  The project is built on four pillars.
[2.00 - 9.70]  Pillar 1, this volume, puts in one place a consensus view of how major federal agencies must be governed and where disagreement exists.
[9.70 - 13.50]  Brackets out these differences for the next president to choose a path.
[13.50 - 19.00]  Pillar 2 is a personnel database that allows candidates to build their own professional profiles,
[19.00 - 22.50]  and our coalition members to review and voice their recommendations.
[22.50 - 29.50]  These recommendations will then be collated and shared with the president-elect's team, greatly streamlining the appointment process.
[29.50 - 37.00]  Pillar 3 is the presidential administration academy, an online educational system taught by experts from our coalition.
[37.00 - 42.50]  For the newcomer, this will explain how the government functions and how to function in government.
[42.50 - 50.00]  For the experienced, we will host in-person seminars with advanced training and set the bar for what is expected of senior leadership.
[50.00 - 58.50]  In Pillar 4, the playbook, we are forming agency teams and drafting transition plans to move out upon the president's utterance of so help me God.
