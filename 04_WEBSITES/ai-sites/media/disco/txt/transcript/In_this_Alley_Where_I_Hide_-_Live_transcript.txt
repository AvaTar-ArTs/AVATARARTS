[0.00 - 8.96]  In moonlight I always were used to sing Now I lonely streets alone
[8.96 - 17.24]  Beneath the stars my heart and stays Dark in nights I always know
[19.24 - 26.88]  Love was sweet but now it's gone At cause of a distinction
[27.08 - 34.88]  How they got took my song Let me wait this day to be glued
[36.88 - 43.88]  The love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
[43.88 - 53.88]  Broken dreams they scatter white In this eye we'll wait right on
[56.88 - 68.88]  I tried to win your heart and fame Some I so believe the moon
[68.88 - 76.88]  But your love was just a chain Now I how the difference is
[77.88 - 86.88]  No more keys said to the rain No more songs without the pain
[86.88 - 95.88]  Freedom found in broken chains Rackle hard beats not insane
[107.88 - 117.88]  Love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
[117.88 - 126.88]  Broken dreams they scatter white In this eye we'll wait right on
[127.88 - 138.88]  Love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
[138.88 - 146.88]  Broken dreams they scatter white In this eye we'll wait right on
[146.88 - 152.88]  If you want to be born
