[4.88 - 11.28]  It is a detailed operational manual, a blueprint for a hostile takeover of the American government.
[11.28 - 14.96]  This document lays out concrete plans for each federal agency.
[14.96 - 20.40]  It details staffing changes, policy reversals, and even suggests legislative priorities
[20.40 - 24.24]  for a future conservative president. The scope is breathtaking.
[24.72 - 30.48]  From the Department of Education to the Environmental Protection Agency,
[30.48 - 35.36]  no agency is spared. Climate change is a hoax. Science is suspect.
[35.36 - 40.32]  Regulations are anathema. This is the world view underpinning the entire project,
[40.32 - 43.92]  and its proponents are disturbingly upfront about their intentions.
[43.92 - 47.68]  They want to dismantle the administrative state, peace by peace.
