[0.00 - 4.00]  I'm lonely at alleys we used to sing
[4.00 - 10.00]  Now I roam these streets alone
[10.00 - 17.00]  I need the stars my heart is stings
[17.00 - 23.00]  Darken nights I've always known
[23.00 - 29.00]  Love was sweet but now it's gone
[29.00 - 35.00]  It goes over a distant truth
[35.00 - 43.00]  Howling cat took my song
[43.00 - 49.00]  Left me with this heavy cloak
[50.00 - 56.00]  No more love songs in the night
[56.00 - 62.00]  All the echoes of our hearts
[62.00 - 68.00]  Oken dreams they scatter white
[68.00 - 76.00]  In the sky we wave our hearts
[76.00 - 81.00]  Try to win your heart in vain
[81.00 - 89.00]  Some are so beneath the moon
[89.00 - 94.00]  But your love was just a shame
[94.00 - 100.00]  Now I'll look different
[100.00 - 106.00]  Now my kiss is in the rain
[106.00 - 113.00]  The more songs without the pain
[113.00 - 119.00]  Freedom found in broken chains
[119.00 - 125.00]  Record on our feet, scorn in vain
[125.00 - 132.00]  No more love songs in the night
[132.00 - 138.00]  All the echoes of our hearts
[138.00 - 144.00]  Oken dreams they scatter white
[144.00 - 153.00]  In the sky we wave our hearts
[153.00 - 160.00]  No more love songs in the night
[160.00 - 166.00]  Only echoes of our hearts
[166.00 - 172.00]  Oken dreams they scatter white
[172.00 - 180.00]  In the sky we wave our hearts
[180.00 - 187.00]  In the sky we wave our hearts
