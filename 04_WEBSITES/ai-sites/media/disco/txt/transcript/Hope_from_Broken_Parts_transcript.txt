[0.00 - 10.92]  In the junkyard where I grew, found some treasure no one knew.
[10.92 - 18.60]  Broken strings and rustic keys became the sound of drinks for free.
[18.60 - 26.12]  Old cans and metal thugs, turned the beats for scraps and junk.
[26.12 - 33.60]  Hands on strings we strung and played, turned trashed at gold each day.
[33.60 - 41.36]  It made new things from the rust, and the myths built from the dust.
[41.36 - 49.60]  Sounded all wrong, broken parts, junkyard's still for me, the hearts.
[50.36 - 55.68]  They were scattered around to see, magic for us symphony.
[55.68 - 61.56]  Crescent doubts with every note, and the truth is that,
[61.56 - 63.84]  we were all in the junkyard.
[63.84 - 66.04]  We were all in the junkyard.
[66.04 - 68.36]  We were all in the junkyard.
[68.36 - 70.88]  We were all in the junkyard.
[70.88 - 74.20]  We were all in the junkyard.
[74.20 - 77.12]  We were all in the junkyard.
[77.12 - 83.20]  Every note, making eye for what they throw.
[83.20 - 90.88]  Raise awareness, spread the words, make the world more than you heard.
[90.88 - 100.28]  From the scraps of hopeless days, build a tomb that rightly lays.
[100.28 - 108.04]  We made new things from the rust, and the myths built from the dust.
[108.04 - 115.76]  Sounded all wrong, broken parts, junkyard's still for me, the hearts.
[130.96 - 138.36]  Raise awareness, spread the words, make the world more than you heard.
[138.36 - 145.84]  From the scraps of hopeless days, build a tomb that rightly lays.
[145.84 - 153.68]  We made new things from the rust, instruments built from the dust.
[153.68 - 161.76]  Sounded all wrong, broken parts, junkyard's still for me, the hearts.
