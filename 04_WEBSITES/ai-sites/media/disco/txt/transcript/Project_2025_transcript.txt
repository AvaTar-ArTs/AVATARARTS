[0.00 - 12.00]  In shadows long and cold, we found the lies unfold
[12.00 - 16.00]  Beneath the whisper's cursed truths yet unentwined
[16.00 - 22.00]  They called it Project 2025, buried deep in the sly beneath the masks
[22.00 - 27.00]  To see their secrets known, soft whispers in the dark
[27.00 - 31.00]  The singer's voice does hark, can't a light reveal the mark
[31.00 - 35.00]  In broken hearts and bark, through forest and sin gray
[35.00 - 41.00]  Where trust is gone astray, in silent cries our fears disdain
[41.00 - 46.00]  Unveil the veil of schemes, shatter the hindrings
[46.00 - 50.00]  In haunting melodies, we chase the silent screams
[50.00 - 55.00]  Project 2025 will tear the truths alive
[55.00 - 59.00]  With every cord and one we fight, we strive
[76.00 - 81.00]  Old ghosts are yesterday, linger in the fray
[81.00 - 85.00]  Echoes in dismay, in the softest voice they sway
[85.00 - 89.00]  We are the light, shining through the night
[89.00 - 93.00]  In hauntings, we'll find our flight
[93.00 - 98.00]  Through broken glass and pain, a truth we shall regain
[98.00 - 102.00]  Their power undermined by love that binds or dain
[102.00 - 106.00]  Under layers of deceit, our voices rise complete
[106.00 - 110.00]  In every note, defy defeat
[110.00 - 114.00]  Unveil the veil of schemes, shatter the hindrings
[114.00 - 118.00]  In haunting melodies, we chase the silent screams
[118.00 - 123.00]  Project 2025 will tear the truths alive
[123.00 - 127.00]  With every cord and one we fight, we strive
[140.00 - 150.00]  Unveil the veil of schemes, shatter the hindrings
[150.00 - 154.00]  In haunted melodies, we chase the silent screams
[154.00 - 158.00]  Project 2025 will tear the truths alive
[158.00 - 162.00]  With every cord and one we fight, we strive
[170.00 - 174.00]  Unveil the veil of schemes, shatter the hindrings
