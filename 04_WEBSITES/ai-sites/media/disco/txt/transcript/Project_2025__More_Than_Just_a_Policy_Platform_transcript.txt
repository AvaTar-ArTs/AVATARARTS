[0.00 - 3.20]  Project 2025 is more than just a policy platform.
[3.20 - 6.88]  It is a call to action for conservatives across the country.
[6.88 - 10.52]  It brings together over 50 conservative organizations
[10.52 - 12.00]  under a shared banner.
[12.00 - 14.92]  Their goal is clear to prepare for a successful
[14.92 - 18.32]  conservative administration in 2025.
[18.32 - 20.56]  This endeavor is not about partisan politics.
[20.56 - 23.80]  It is about reclaiming America's founding principles.
[23.80 - 26.36]  These principles include limited government,
[26.36 - 29.60]  individual freedom, and a strong national defense.
[30.00 - 33.40]  Project 2025 seeks to translate these principles
[33.40 - 35.40]  into concrete policy solutions.
