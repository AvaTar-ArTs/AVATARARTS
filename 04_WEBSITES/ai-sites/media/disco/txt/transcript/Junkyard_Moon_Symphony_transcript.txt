[0.00 - 19.00]  In the junkyard where I played with this grass and broken dreams found the world where music stayed in the quiet middle scenes.
[19.00 - 25.00]  Old cans would be my drums, broken strings would be my tomb.
[25.00 - 32.00]  For every beat my heart don'ts in the light of the junkyard moon.
[32.00 - 39.00]  Play my junkyards in front of me.
[39.00 - 45.00]  Hear the magic in the night.
[45.00 - 52.00]  Raise our hands in unity.
[52.00 - 58.00]  Feel the hope and see the light.
[58.00 - 68.00]  When the shadows start to creep and the world begins to fade from the silence.
[68.00 - 72.00]  Deep, deep, deep.
[72.00 - 78.00]  Music always finds its way.
[78.00 - 84.00]  With the song we fight the dark, raise our voice in harmony.
[84.00 - 97.00]  Every note will make its mark in our junkyard symphony.
[97.00 - 103.00]  Play my junkyards in front of me.
[103.00 - 109.00]  Hear the magic in the night.
[109.00 - 116.00]  Raise our hands in unity.
[116.00 - 122.00]  Feel the hope and see the light.
[122.00 - 129.00]  When the song we fight the dark, raise our voice in harmony.
[129.00 - 141.00]  Every note will make its mark in our junkyard symphony.
[141.00 - 148.00]  Play my junkyards in front of me.
[148.00 - 154.00]  Hear the magic in the night.
[154.00 - 161.00]  Raise our hands in unity.
[161.00 - 168.00]  Feel the hope and see the light.
[178.00 - 185.00]  Music.
