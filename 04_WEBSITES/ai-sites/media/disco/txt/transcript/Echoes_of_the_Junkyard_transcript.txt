[0.00 - 13.00]  Porn on the scrap in the rust and the dust
[13.00 - 22.00]  He found his melody, and the things left lost
[22.50 - 26.00]  Strings of wiretimes
[27.00 - 31.00]  Hands and old wood blocks
[31.00 - 35.00]  He played his heart out
[35.00 - 39.00]  With the rhythm of the clock
[39.00 - 44.00]  That cause of the junkyard
[44.00 - 48.00]  Sounds of hope and trees
[48.50 - 53.00]  And much made the music
[53.00 - 58.00]  From forgotten things
[58.00 - 62.00]  People gathered around
[62.00 - 67.00]  So here he is, junkyard song
[67.00 - 71.00]  A spark of a wonderful
[71.00 - 76.00]  In the beat so strong
[76.00 - 81.00]  When shadows tried to take
[81.00 - 84.00]  The home he loved and knew
[84.00 - 89.00]  He's strong to louder for their sake
[89.00 - 93.00]  Inspiring heart to new
[93.00 - 98.00]  Echoes of the junkyard
[98.00 - 102.00]  Sounds of hope and trees
[102.00 - 107.00]  And much made the music
[107.00 - 112.00]  From forgotten things
[122.00 - 126.00]  When shadows tried to take
[126.00 - 129.00]  The home he loved and knew
[129.00 - 134.00]  He's strong to louder for their sake
[134.00 - 139.00]  Inspiring heart to new
[139.00 - 143.00]  Echoes of the junkyard
[143.00 - 147.00]  Sounds of hope and trees
[147.00 - 152.00]  And much made the music
[152.00 - 157.00]  From forgotten things
