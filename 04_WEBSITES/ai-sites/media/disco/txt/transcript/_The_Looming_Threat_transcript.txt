[0.00 - 12.08]  The 2025 Presidential Transition Project is the conservative movement's unified effort
[12.08 - 19.24]  to be ready for the next conservative administration to govern at 12 noon January 20, 2025.
[19.24 - 20.64]  Welcome to the mission.
[20.64 - 23.64]  By opening this book, you are now a part of it.
[23.64 - 28.44]  Indeed, one set of eyes reading these passages will be those of the 47th President of the
[28.44 - 33.36]  United States, and we hope every other reader will join in making the incoming administration
[33.36 - 34.60]  a success.
[34.60 - 39.58]  In the winter of 1980, the fledgling Heritage Foundation handed to President-elect Ronald
[39.58 - 43.16]  Reagan the inaugural mandate for leadership.
[43.16 - 47.44]  This collective work by conservative thought leaders and former government hands, most
[47.44 - 52.36]  of whom were not part of heritage, set out policy prescriptions, agency by agency for
[52.36 - 53.92]  the incoming president.
[53.92 - 57.92]  The book literally put the conservative movement and Reagan on the same page, and the
[57.92 - 62.68]  revolution that followed might never have been, save for this band of committed and volunteer
[62.68 - 63.68]  activists.
[63.68 - 65.44]  It's not 1980.
[65.44 - 68.04]  In 2023, the game has changed.
[68.04 - 72.44]  The long march of cultural Marxism through our institutions has come to pass.
[72.44 - 77.00]  The federal government is a behemoth, weaponized against American citizens and conservative
[77.00 - 81.16]  values, with freedom and liberty under siege as never before.
[81.16 - 86.20]  The task at hand to reverse this tide and restore our republic to its original morings is too
[86.20 - 89.60]  great for any one conservative policy shop to spearhead.
[89.60 - 92.32]  It requires the collective action of our movement.
[92.32 - 96.92]  With the quickening approach of January 2025 we have two years and one chance to get it
[96.92 - 97.92]  right.
[97.92 - 99.76]  The project is built on four pillars.
[99.76 - 104.54]  Pillar 1, this volume, puts in one place a consensus view of how major federal agencies
[104.54 - 107.72]  must be governed and where disagreement exists.
[107.72 - 111.24]  Brackets out these differences for the next president to choose a path.
[111.24 - 115.52]  Pillar 2 is a personnel database that allows candidates to build their own professional
[115.52 - 120.20]  profiles and our coalition members to review and voice their recommendations.
[120.20 - 124.28]  These recommendations will then be collated and shared with the president-elect's team,
[124.28 - 127.12]  greatly streamlining the appointment process.
[127.12 - 132.32]  Pillar 3 is the Presidential Administration Academy, an online educational system taught
[132.32 - 134.60]  by experts from our coalition.
[134.60 - 138.84]  For the newcomer, this will explain how the government functions and how to function in
[138.84 - 139.92]  government.
[139.92 - 144.56]  For the experienced, we will host in-person seminars with advanced training and set the
[144.56 - 147.56]  bar for what is expected of senior leadership.
[147.56 - 152.62]  In Pillar 4, the playbook, we are forming agency teams and drafting transition plans to
[152.62 - 156.36]  move out upon the president's utterance of so help me God.
[156.36 - 160.68]  As Americans living at the approach of our nation's 250th birthday, we have been given
[160.68 - 161.68]  much.
[161.68 - 162.44]  As conservative.
