[0.00 - 3.52]  In the beginning there was only chaos, an empty void.
[3.52 - 6.40]  Yet from this void emerged the first divine beings,
[6.40 - 11.12]  Gaia, the Bountiful Earth, Tatarus, the darkest pit of the underworld,
[11.12 - 14.00]  and Eros, the embodiment of love.
[14.00 - 17.68]  As time passed, these ancient deities gave birth to the Titans,
[17.68 - 20.48]  colossal entities who would shape the world as we know it.
[20.48 - 26.00]  The marriage of Gea and Uranus, the sky, was not one of love, but of necessity.
[26.00 - 28.88]  Their union brought forth two unique sets of offspring,
[28.88 - 31.20]  the hundred-handed giants and the Cyclops,
[31.20 - 33.52]  beings of immense power and strength.
[33.52 - 36.56]  Yet Uranus, overwhelmed with fear and repulsion,
[36.56 - 39.12]  cast his children into the depths of Tatarus,
[39.12 - 42.80]  igniting the spark of a conflict that would shake the cosmos.
[42.80 - 46.40]  Gaia, heartbroken and furious at Uranus for his betrayal,
[46.40 - 51.52]  crafted an adamant encycl and passed it to their youngest son, Cronus.
[51.52 - 55.20]  Seizing the opportunity, Cronus ambushed his father,
[55.20 - 58.24]  overthrowing the Sky God in a shocking act of betrayal,
[58.32 - 62.24]  With Uranus dethroned, Cronus took his place as ruler of the universe.
[62.24 - 65.36]  However, a prophecy foretold that one of Cronus' own children
[65.36 - 68.72]  would overthrow him, just as he had done to his father.
[68.72 - 73.12]  Paralyzed by fear, Cronus swallowed each of his children as they were born,
[73.12 - 75.52]  hoping to evade his prophesied downfall.
[75.52 - 81.36]  Yet, rear, Cronus' wife was not one to stand by as her children met such a horrifying fate.
[81.36 - 86.16]  When her youngest son Zeus was born, she devised a cunning plan to save him.
[86.16 - 89.84]  Instead of handing Zeus to Cronus, she gave him a stone swaddled in cloth,
[89.84 - 92.56]  which he swallowed without a second thought.
[92.56 - 95.44]  Meanwhile, Zeus was safely hidden away, growing stronger,
[95.44 - 97.44]  and waiting for the day he would face his father.
[98.24 - 102.24]  And when that day came, the universe would witness a battle of epic proportions.
[102.24 - 106.32]  The Tetonomachy, a fierce and brutal war between the Titans,
[106.32 - 109.68]  and the newly emerged Olympian gods, armed with a thunderbolt,
[109.68 - 114.00]  a weapon forged by the liberated Cycloppers, Zeus led the charge against the Titans.
[114.64 - 120.16]  The battle was fierce, but the Titans, once rulers of the Cosmos, were finally overthrown.
[120.72 - 125.20]  Zeus, with his siblings at his side, claimed their rightful place as rulers,
[125.20 - 127.84]  establishing a new era of divine dominion.
[127.84 - 131.76]  Yet the universe is a vast place, and Zeus' rule was just the beginning.
[132.48 - 136.72]  The Cosmos is teeming with other gods, each with their own stories and powers,
[136.72 - 139.76]  waiting to be discovered. So, who are these gods?
[140.72 - 143.44]  And what tales of triumph, betrayal, and love do they hold?
[143.44 - 145.92]  Well, that is a story for another time.
