[0.00 - 14.00]  In the junkyard where I play With the scraps and broken dreams
[14.00 - 24.00]  Found a world where music stayed In the quiet metal seams
[24.00 - 34.00]  All cans would be my drums Broken strings would be my tune
[34.00 - 42.00]  For every beat my heart thongs In the light of the junkyard moon
[42.00 - 52.00]  Play my junkyard symphony Here the magic in the night
[52.00 - 64.00]  Raise our heads in unity Feel the hope and see the light
[72.00 - 80.00]  When the shadows start to creep And the world begins to fade
[80.00 - 90.00]  From the silence deep deep deep Music always finds its way
[90.00 - 100.00]  With the song we fight the dark Raise our voice in harmony
[100.00 - 112.00]  Every note will make its mark In a junkyard symphony
[112.00 - 122.00]  Play my junkyard symphony Here the magic in the night
[122.00 - 132.00]  Raise our heads in unity Feel the hope and see the light
[132.00 - 142.00]  When the songs we fight the dark Raise our voice in harmony
[142.00 - 150.00]  Every note will make its mark In a junkyard symphony
[150.00 - 160.00]  Play my junkyard symphony Here the magic in the night
[160.00 - 170.00]  Raise our heads in unity Feel the hope and see the light
[190.00 - 200.00]  In a junkyard symphony Here the magic in the night
