[0.00 - 12.00]  In the room in the alley we used to sing now our own these streets alone.
[12.00 - 21.00]  Beneath the stars my heart it stings darken nights I've always known.
[21.50 - 29.00]  Love was sweeping now it's gone that goes over distant.
[30.00 - 39.00]  Howling cat took my song left me with this heavy gloom.
[40.00 - 46.00]  No more love songs in the night.
[47.00 - 55.00]  Only echoes of our fight.
[56.00 - 68.00]  Broken dreams they scatter wide in the sally where I hide.
[69.00 - 75.00]  I tried to win your heart in vain.
[75.00 - 79.00]  Some I so beneath the moon.
[79.00 - 86.00]  But your love was just a chain now how the different two.
[86.00 - 91.00]  No more kisses in the rain.
[91.00 - 95.00]  No more songs without the pain.
[95.00 - 99.00]  Freedom found in broken chains.
[99.00 - 105.00]  Wrapped in heartbeat's gone insane.
[105.00 - 114.00]  No more love songs in the night.
[114.00 - 122.00]  Only echoes of our fight.
[123.00 - 132.00]  Broken dreams they scatter wide in the sally where I hide.
[132.00 - 157.00]  No more love songs in the night.
[157.00 - 166.00]  Only echoes of our fight.
[166.00 - 179.00]  Broken dreams they scatter wide in the sally where I hide.
