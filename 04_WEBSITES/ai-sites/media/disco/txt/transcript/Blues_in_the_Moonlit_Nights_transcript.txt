[0.00 - 4.00]  With those waste burning in the midnight breeze
[4.00 - 8.00]  Hornets strings playing melodies with ease
[8.00 - 12.00]  Shadows dance under a silvery glow
[12.00 - 18.00]  Wants some travelers with no place to go
[18.00 - 22.00]  No turtle notes, flying high and free
[22.00 - 28.00]  Echoes a lingering from an old oak tree
[28.00 - 32.00]  Crickets chirping, they're mournful or faint
[32.00 - 36.00]  More like kissing windowpane
[36.00 - 41.00]  Hose in the moonlight, they seem so low
[41.00 - 45.00]  Hearts strings pulling with a wild wind's blow
[45.00 - 49.00]  Serenade from spears, lost and found
[49.00 - 54.00]  In the whispers of the night, our souls are bowed
[54.00 - 58.00]  Stars are peeping through the velvet shrub
[58.00 - 62.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
[62.00 - 66.00]  Dreams are waving through the choir
[66.00 - 72.00]  In the dance of sharks, midnight fear
[72.00 - 84.00]  Lonely roads twist around a bend
[84.00 - 90.00]  And the stories with no start or end
[90.00 - 94.00]  Feelers playing by the pale moonlight
[94.00 - 98.00]  Hopeless hearts taking through the night
[98.00 - 102.00]  Blues in the moonlight, they seem so low
[102.00 - 106.00]  Hearts strings pulling with a wild wind's blow
[106.00 - 110.00]  Serenade from spears, lost and found
[110.00 - 116.00]  In the whispers of the night, our souls are bowed
[128.00 - 132.00]  Stars are peeping through the velvet shrub
[132.00 - 136.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
[136.00 - 140.00]  Dreams are waving through the velvet shrub
[140.00 - 144.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
[144.00 - 148.00]  Dreams are waving through the velvet shrub
[148.00 - 152.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
[152.00 - 156.00]  Dreams are waving through the velvet shrub
[156.00 - 160.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
[160.00 - 164.00]  Dreams are waving through the velvet shrub
[164.00 - 168.00]  The silveryness is too alone so crout
