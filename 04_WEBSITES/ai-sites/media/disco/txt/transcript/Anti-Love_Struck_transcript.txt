[0.00 - 12.00]  In the alleyway, where coins and full swing Thumbs of fire glow Happy hour's flame
[12.00 - 22.00]  We're trashed in skins No love in our eyes In defendant's jouts Under city skies
[23.00 - 34.00]  Stars cast take over Our streets gone Free off from cover
[34.00 - 45.00]  And silo strut Courage in the night Rats scurry past We home this fight
[45.00 - 53.00]  Our castle lasts We're taking soupine We're lonely free
[53.00 - 63.00]  So strike me find Together in broad dash cast take over
[63.00 - 72.00]  Our streets gone Free off from cover And silo strut
[80.00 - 87.00]  Courage in the night Rats scurry past We home this fight
[87.00 - 96.00]  Our castle lasts No change to find we're lonely free
[96.00 - 106.00]  So strike me find Together we broke Dash cast take over
[106.00 - 115.00]  Our streets gone Free off from cover And silo strut
[117.00 - 128.00]  Courage in the night Rats scurry past We home this fight
[128.00 - 131.00]  Our castle lasts
