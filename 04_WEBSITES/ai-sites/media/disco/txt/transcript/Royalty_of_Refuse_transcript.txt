[0.00 - 11.20]  In the shadows where the early cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass east of town,
[11.20 - 20.20]  a scavenged treasure from the tale of the cities from, live fast, live trash beneath the moon's hostel hall.
[21.20 - 29.20]  By the fire's orange glow, a kingdom rises from the scrap.
[29.20 - 39.20]  She hums the blues of a life call in the traps, rusty hearts beating in synchroptin plastic wrap.
[39.20 - 46.20]  A royalty of refuse, loving a discarded man.
[47.20 - 53.20]  Law is rubbish, let's get trashy in the night.
[53.20 - 65.20]  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, if monsters was home and can still lift the light.
[65.20 - 74.20]  We find love burned bright by the polluted light, her eyes are dying, and some wrong-the-broken bottles.
[75.20 - 89.20]  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle, stories of old-star dust, told in street lamp bottles with everything from the drum, or the empty milk bottle.
[89.20 - 101.20]  The straight dogs bark, a mournful tune, alley symphony, our own lances feral, wild as the wind, unchained.
[101.20 - 112.20]  No fancy words, no clean papers to creak, the trash we thrive, hearts wild up and debris.
[112.20 - 119.20]  Law is rubbish, let's get trashy in the night.
[119.20 - 131.20]  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, if monsters were home and can still lift the light.
[131.20 - 139.20]  We find love burned bright by the polluted light.
[139.20 - 146.20]  Law is rubbish, let's get trashy in the night.
[146.20 - 168.20]  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, if monsters were home and can still lift the light.
[169.20 - 175.20]  We find love burned bright by the polluted light.
[175.20 - 181.20]  Law is rubbish, let's get trashy in the night.
[181.20 - 194.20]  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, if monsters were home and can still lift the light.
[194.20 - 201.20]  We find love burned bright by the polluted light.
