[0.00 - 5.68]  In the winter of 1980, the Fledgling Heritage Foundation handed to President-elect Ronald Reagan
[5.68 - 11.60]  the inaugural mandate for leadership. This collective work by conservative thought leaders and former
[11.60 - 16.64]  government hands, most of whom were not part of heritage, set out policy prescriptions,
[16.64 - 21.60]  agency by agency for the incoming president. The book literally put the conservative movement
[21.60 - 26.00]  and Reagan on the same page, and the revolution that followed might never have been,
[26.00 - 29.28]  save for this band of committed and volunteer activists.
