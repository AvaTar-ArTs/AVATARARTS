[0.00 - 7.00]  And who let out is we used to sing now our own these streets along
[7.00 - 15.00]  Beneath the stars my heart it stings darken nights I've always known
[15.00 - 22.00]  Love a sweet button now it's gone it goes of the distance
[23.00 - 29.00]  Howling cat to my soul left me with this heavy blue
[29.00 - 37.00]  No more low songs in the night only echoes of our fight
[37.00 - 46.00]  Broken dreams they skyrocket in this alley where I hide
[52.00 - 64.00]  I tried to win your heart and fame some by so beneath the moon
[64.00 - 74.00]  But your love was just a chain now I howled different to no more kisses in the rain
[74.00 - 81.00]  No more songs without the pen freedom found in broken chains
[81.00 - 92.00]  Right could heartbeat's gone insane no more low songs in the night only echoes of our fight
[92.00 - 102.00]  Broken dreams they skyrocket in this alley where I hide
[102.00 - 110.00]  No more low songs in the night only echoes of our fight
[110.00 - 120.00]  Broken dreams they skyrocket in this alley where I hide
[123.00 - 126.00]  Where I hide
[126.00 - 138.00]  No more low songs in the night only echoes of our fight
[138.00 - 147.00]  Broken dreams they skyrocket in this alley where I hide
[156.00 - 163.00]  I tried to win your heart and fame some by so beneath the moon
