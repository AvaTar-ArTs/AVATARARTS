00:00 -- 00:16:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights with raccoon band and alley lights
00:16 -- 00:21:  Love ballad soft in the dark, till one night love left a mark
00:21 -- 00:26:  Howling Cat took Sammy's throne, winning contests all alone
00:26 -- 00:36:  Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues
00:36 -- 00:46:  Oh Sammy, why oh why did the Alley Cat steal your sky?
00:46 -- 00:56:  Once you sang of love and light, now your song's bright at night
01:16 -- 01:30:  Raccoon band plays out of tunes since that fateful night in June
01:30 -- 01:35:  Howling Cat's song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud
01:35 -- 01:40:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree
01:40 -- 01:50:  Violets now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:50 -- 02:00:  Moonlit alleys still remember, songs of love in soft September
02:00 -- 02:10:  Sammy sings with feral spine, turning love into a fight
02:30 -- 02:48:  Thanks for watching!
