[0.00 - 8.00]  I'm under the neon flicker, ooh nice scattered
[8.00 - 14.00]  Raccoon's dream broken glass shatter
[14.00 - 21.00]  Diving in downstairs, loves a dirty game
[21.00 - 28.00]  Heartbreak, how are we in nothing to
[29.00 - 36.00]  Whiskey rains falling, the left behind
[36.00 - 44.00]  Don't stir fires, we're broken hearts bind
[44.00 - 51.00]  Junk your kings with their empty kills
[52.00 - 59.00]  Whisper's a one buried in the sand
[59.00 - 66.00]  Live fast, here's our trash, when night's upon is gone in fact
[66.00 - 74.00]  Party out by the fireside bone
[74.00 - 79.00]  In the rubble, where wild dreams flow
[79.00 - 86.00]  Us the echoes of the night bend
[86.00 - 93.00]  Scavenstrasters in our else trashed hands
[93.00 - 100.00]  Sider and smoke, lingles with the stars
[100.00 - 108.00]  In the world of clutter, nothing's gone too far
[108.00 - 115.00]  These sightales wrapped in our newspaper
[115.00 - 122.00]  Love's graffiti scribbled by the paper
[122.00 - 129.00]  Broken hearts, singing all at once
[129.00 - 135.00]  In the downstairs, loves a dirty game
[135.00 - 143.00]  Heartbreak, how are we in nothing to be
[143.00 - 150.00]  Whiskey rains falling, the left behind
[150.00 - 157.00]  In the rubble, where wild dreams flow
[171.00 - 178.00]  These sightales wrapped in our newspaper
[179.00 - 185.00]  Love's graffiti scribbled by the paper
[185.00 - 193.00]  Broken hearts, singing all at once
[193.00 - 199.00]  In the downstairs, we're lost love lives
[199.00 - 206.00]  Whisper's a one buried in the sand
[206.00 - 213.00]  Live fast, here's our trash, when night's upon is gone in fact
[213.00 - 214.00]  Party out by the fireside bone
[214.00 - 221.00]  In the rubble, where wild dreams flow
[229.00 - 236.00]  Whisper's a one buried in the sand
