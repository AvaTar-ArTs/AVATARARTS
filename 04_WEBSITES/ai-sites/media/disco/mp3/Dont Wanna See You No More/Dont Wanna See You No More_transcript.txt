00:00 -- 00:26:  We had our moment, we had our time But now it's over, I'm drawing the line
00:26 -- 00:35:  No more late nights, no more calls I'm moving on, I'm breaking these walls
00:35 -- 00:44:  You think I'm missing you, but baby I'm not I found my rhythm and I'm hitting that spot
00:44 -- 00:51:  No more looking back, I'm feeling so free I'm loving my life, just being me
00:51 -- 00:59:  I don't wanna see you no more Close the trap and shut that door
00:59 -- 01:10:  Living my life on my own Better off now that you're gone
01:10 -- 01:19:  All those memories, they fade away Sunshine's here and it's a brand new day
01:19 -- 01:27:  Dancing solo, I'm loving the groove I found my peace, I found my truth
01:27 -- 01:36:  You think I'm missing you, but baby I'm not I found my rhythm and I'm hitting that spot
01:36 -- 01:43:  No more looking back, I'm feeling so free I'm loving my life, just being me
01:43 -- 01:52:  I don't wanna see you no more Close the trap and shut that door
01:52 -- 02:01:  Living my life on my own Better off now that you're gone
02:01 -- 02:11:  Every step I take, I'm stronger than before Every breath I breathe, I'm loving it more
02:11 -- 02:18:  You had your chance, but now it's all mine I'm shining bright, it's my time to shine
02:18 -- 02:27:  I don't wanna see you no more Close the trap and shut that door
02:27 -- 02:35:  Living my life on my own Better off now that you're gone
02:35 -- 02:44:  I don't wanna see you no more Close the trap and shut that door
02:44 -- 02:53:  Living my life on my own Better off now that you're gone
02:53 -- 03:02:  I don't wanna see you no more Close the trap and shut that door
03:02 -- 03:12:  Living my life on my own Better off now that you're gone
