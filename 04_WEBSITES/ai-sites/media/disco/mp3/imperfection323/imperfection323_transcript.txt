00:00 -- 00:22:  Rusty chains tangled round a broken swing A dandelion blooms where the thorns cling
00:22 -- 00:29:  Scratched up records play the same sad song We danced in shadows where we both belong
00:29 -- 00:36:  Graffiti hearts on the crumbling walls Faded vows and spray-paint scrawls
00:36 -- 00:44:  In the cluttered streets we found our place Embracing flaws in a lover's grace
00:44 -- 01:00:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive In champagne and neon lights, we come alive
01:01 -- 01:16:  Love and imperfection, a story so old In our disarray, we found gold
01:19 -- 01:27:  Midnight whispers through shattered glass Lost in the echoes of a broken past
01:27 -- 01:34:  You are your laugh, my silent cry In our barbed wire world, we touch the sky
01:34 -- 01:41:  Among the wreckage, flowers grow Bitter sweet love, all we know
01:41 -- 01:50:  In the disarray, hearts beating fast A beautiful mess, our love to last
01:51 -- 02:05:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive In champagne and neon lights, we come alive
02:05 -- 02:20:  Love and imperfection, a story so old In our disarray, we found gold
02:35 -- 02:50:  It's a beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive In champagne and neon lights, we come alive
02:50 -- 03:04:  Love and imperfection, a story so old In our disarray, we found gold
03:05 -- 03:14:  Love and imperfection, a story so old In our disarray, we found gold
