00:00 -- 00:20:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights With raccoon band and alley lights
00:20 -- 00:26:  Love ballad soft in the dark Till one night love left a mark
00:26 -- 00:33:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne Winning contest all alone
00:33 -- 00:41:  Sammy's heart was torn in twos Music now laced with blues
00:41 -- 00:55:  Oh Sammy, why, oh why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:55 -- 01:12:  Once you sang of love and light Now your song's spied in the night
01:12 -- 01:19:  Raccoon band plays out of tune Since that fateful night in June
01:19 -- 01:26:  Howling cat's song took the crowd Left poor Sammy crying loud
01:26 -- 01:34:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee Heartbreak under the willow tree
01:34 -- 01:43:  Balance now with teeth and claws Raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:43 -- 01:57:  Oh Sammy, why, oh why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
01:57 -- 02:11:  Once you sang of love and light Now your song's spied in the night
02:11 -- 02:18:  Moonlit alleys still remember Songs of love in soft September
02:18 -- 02:26:  Sammy sings with feral spite Turning love into a fight
