00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:20 -- 00:33:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight If sun be gone, we carry on, spirit as our guide
00:33 -- 00:56:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
00:56 -- 01:11:  Gently into the black, hushed and silent sea Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:11 -- 01:37:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand, hold on fast Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
01:37 -- 02:04:  Take my hand, on we march, if I fall, leave me there Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
02:07 -- 02:23:  And the hollow echoes with the past lives of our souls We will walk this earth forever until the earth reclaims our bones
02:23 -- 02:37:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
