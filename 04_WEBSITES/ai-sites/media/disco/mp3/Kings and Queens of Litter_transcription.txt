[0.00 - 16.00]  In the shadows where the alley cats grow, broken dreams and shattered glassy stuff town.
[16.00 - 26.00]  The sky was treasure from the tale of the city's frown, live fast, live trash beneath the moon's hustle-how.
[26.00 - 38.00]  By the fires orange glow our kingdom rises from the scrap she hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
[38.00 - 50.00]  Rusty hearts beating in sync wrapped in plastic wrap, where royalty of refuse love in a discarded map.
[50.00 - 60.00]  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
[60.00 - 70.00]  With dupsters for a throne and cans filled with delight we find a burning pipe by the polluted light.
[70.00 - 82.00]  Horizon diamonds hung on the broken bottles, reaching cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
[82.00 - 92.00]  Stories of old star dust, told in street lamp waddles with every beak from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
[92.00 - 104.00]  The straight old parka mourn for tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the wind on shame.
[104.00 - 114.00]  Free no fancy words, no clean papers to creak, in the trash we thrive hearts wild and debris.
[114.00 - 124.00]  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
[124.00 - 134.00]  With dupsters for a throne and cans filled with delight we find a burning pipe by the polluted light.
[134.00 - 144.00]  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
[144.00 - 162.00]  With dupsters for a throne and cans filled with delight we find a burning pipe by the polluted light.
[162.00 - 180.00]  Horizon diamonds hung on the broken bottles, reaching cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
[180.00 - 192.00]  Stories of old star dust, told in street lamp waddles with every beak from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
[192.00 - 204.00]  The straight old parka mourn for tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the wind on shame.
[204.00 - 216.00]  Free no fancy words, no clean papers to creak, in the trash we thrive hearts wild and debris.
[216.00 - 226.00]  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
