00:00 -- 00:17:  Soft whispers on the wind Through the hills we walk
00:17 -- 00:23:  Your hand in mine Finding strength in the talk
00:23 -- 00:26:  The stars above Like old friends lighting the park
00:26 -- 00:36:  Feel my heart beats in the dark Heart beats in the dark
00:36 -- 00:42:  Through the shadows we tread On pathways unknown
00:42 -- 00:50:  But worry not for you're not alone A beacon of hope
00:50 -- 00:56:  In the silence we embark Feel my heart beats in the dark
00:56 -- 01:08:  Heart beats in the dark
01:08 -- 01:13:  When the night seems long And the road so far
01:13 -- 01:19:  Just listen for the rhythm Of my beating heart
01:19 -- 01:24:  Together we'll journey Through life's pitch and bark
01:24 -- 01:34:  Feel my heart beats in the dark Heart beats in the dark
01:34 -- 01:39:  In the quiet moments When words start to fade
01:39 -- 01:45:  And the fears come creeping Don't be afraid
01:45 -- 01:49:  For every step you take I'm never far
01:49 -- 01:58:  Feel my heart beats in the dark Heart beats in the dark
01:58 -- 02:09:  Close your eyes and lean into the sound A symphony of love in the night profound
02:09 -- 02:17:  Unseen but unfaltering like an ember spark Feel my heart beats in the dark
02:17 -- 02:24:  Heart beats in the dark
02:24 -- 02:27:  When the morning comes And the shadows recede
02:27 -- 02:32:  You'll see the journey was just what you need With every heartbeat
02:32 -- 02:38:  A promise to mark Feel my heart beats in the dark
02:38 -- 03:01:  Heart beats in the dark
03:01 -- 03:06:  When the night seems long And the road so far
03:06 -- 03:12:  Just listen for the rhythm Of my beating heart
03:12 -- 03:17:  Together we'll journey Through life's pitch and bark
03:17 -- 03:25:  Feel my heart beats in the dark Heart beats in the dark
03:25 -- 03:50:  Close your eyes and lean into the sound A symphony of love in the night profound
03:50 -- 03:56:  Unseen but unfaltering like an ember spark Feel my heart beats in the dark
03:57 -- 03:59:  Heart beats in the dark
