00:00 -- 00:17:  Once the king of this place called the alley
00:17 -- 00:22:  Sammy ruled with his tune and his rally
00:22 -- 00:27:  But a howling cat came and stole his throne
00:27 -- 00:33:  Now Sammy sings his blues all alone
00:33 -- 00:39:  In the moonlight he strums with sadness
00:39 -- 00:44:  Echoes bounce off the walls of his madness
00:44 -- 00:50:  Every note from his heart always true
00:50 -- 00:55:  In the shadows he fights with the blue
00:55 -- 00:58:  Oh Sammy once the alley king
00:58 -- 01:01:  Now his chords just cry and sting
01:01 -- 01:03:  With every whisper of his string
01:03 -- 01:06:  He dreams of the days he used to sing
01:06 -- 01:12:  On the corner where the streetlight flickers
01:12 -- 01:17:  He remembers when his fame was thicker
01:17 -- 01:23:  But the howling cat's got a brand new show
01:23 -- 01:28:  And now Sammy's sorrow starts to flow
01:28 -- 01:34:  Heart breaks the beat that he now knows
01:34 -- 01:39:  Defiance burns where his music grows
01:39 -- 01:45:  He won't give up these alleyways
01:45 -- 01:50:  Cause in his soul the fire stays
01:50 -- 01:53:  Oh Sammy once the alley king
01:53 -- 01:56:  Now his chords just cry and sing
01:56 -- 01:59:  With every whisper of his string
01:59 -- 02:01:  He dreams of the days he used to sing
02:01 -- 02:04:  Oh Sammy once the alley king
02:04 -- 02:07:  Now his chords just cry and sting
02:07 -- 02:10:  With every whisper of his string
02:10 -- 02:12:  He dreams of the days he used to sing
02:15 -- 02:18:  Oh Sammy once the alley king
02:18 -- 02:21:  Now his chords just cry and sting
02:21 -- 02:23:  With every whisper of his string
02:24 -- 02:26:  He dreams of the days he used to sing
02:29 -- 02:30:  He used to sing
02:32 -- 02:35:  Heart brace the beat
