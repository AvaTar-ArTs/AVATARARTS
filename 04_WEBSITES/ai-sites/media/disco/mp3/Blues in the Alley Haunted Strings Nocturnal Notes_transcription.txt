[0.00 - 16.00]  In an alley where shadows dance with spurs of lost romance
[16.00 - 28.00]  Fade light from a dying moon, strong of a haunted tomb
[28.00 - 40.00]  Old guitar, strings, warmth and play by ghosts that might have been
[40.00 - 52.00]  Midnight when in hollow dreams, not sweet through nights' seas
[52.00 - 62.00]  Blues and mealy at ghost faith, nocturnal notes we've made, under me the city's side
[62.00 - 66.00]  Haunted strings softly cry
[68.00 - 80.00]  Footsteps pass, unseen faces, silent empty sea places
[80.00 - 90.00]  A melody of broken sorrows, loneliness in the tomorrow's
[90.00 - 104.00]  Can you hear it? A song of night, heartbeat's lost, out of sight
[104.00 - 116.00]  In this alley, time stands still, the notes of green, a bit turned up
[118.00 - 128.00]  Stars watch over tales on toll, moments share, broken
[128.00 - 144.00]  Strings whisper, beneath the dark, trace and scars on the heart
[144.00 - 164.00]  Blues and mealy at ghost faith, nocturnal notes we've made, under me the city's side
[164.00 - 176.00]  Haunted strings softly cry, footsteps pass, unseen faces, silent empty sea places
[178.00 - 192.00]  A melody of broken sorrows, loneliness in the tomorrow's
[194.00 - 204.00]  Can you hear it? A song of night, heartbeat's lost, out of sight
