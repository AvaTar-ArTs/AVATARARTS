00:00 -- 00:09:  Broken bottles make a sound Cans and lids we gathered round
00:09 -- 00:19:  Junkyard piles turned to gold He showed a story to be told
00:19 -- 00:28:  Strings from wires strummed with care Keys from pipes everywhere
00:28 -- 00:38:  He found rhythm in the waste Gave each piece a special place
00:38 -- 00:47:  Recycled symphony Playing for you and me
00:47 -- 00:59:  Turned the trash to timeless truth Music from the old to new
00:59 -- 01:08:  Hearts and hands came to play Instruments of every kind
01:08 -- 01:18:  Together we make music strong Finding beauty in the wrong
01:18 -- 01:27:  With every beat we take a stand Inspire hope across this land
01:27 -- 01:37:  From the wreckage we arise With harmony we touch the skies
01:37 -- 01:46:  Recycled symphony Playing for you and me
01:46 -- 01:59:  Turned the trash to timeless truth Music from the old to new
02:07 -- 02:17:  With every beat we take a stand Inspire hope across this land
02:17 -- 02:27:  From the wreckage we arise With harmony we touch the skies
02:27 -- 02:36:  Recycled symphony Playing for you and me
02:36 -- 02:49:  Turned the trash to timeless truth Music from the old to new
