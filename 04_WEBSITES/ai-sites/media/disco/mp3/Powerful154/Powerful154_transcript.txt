00:00 -- 00:06:  Dark alley, shadows shifting Echo of gold chains clinking
00:06 -- 00:11:  City breathes tension Heroes and villains, brink the collision
00:11 -- 00:17:  Masked faces in the twilight Good and evil, constant fight
00:17 -- 00:22:  Powerful in the moonlight Heart beating strong
00:23 -- 00:33:  Born to win, breaking through the darkness Can't you see I'm flying high
00:33 -- 00:46:  Every day we rise, let it go Ain't no need to worry, let the fire ignite
00:47 -- 01:00:  Hero on a journey, brave enough to worry Running in the battle with my sword
01:00 -- 01:06:  We'll never stop the mission, don't be afraid to listen
01:06 -- 01:13:  Running in the battle with my sword
01:13 -- 01:21:  Born to win, breaking through the darkness Can't you see I'm flying high
01:21 -- 01:35:  Every day we rise, let it go Ain't no need to worry, let the fire ignite
01:36 -- 01:42:  A different kind of war A different kind of love
01:42 -- 01:50:  I'm just a man and I know that you understand It takes a different kind of touch
