00:00 -- 00:19:  Sammie sang in moonlit nights With raccoon band and alley lights
00:19 -- 00:27:  Love ballads soft in the dark Till one night love left a mark
00:27 -- 00:32:  Howlin' cat took Sammie's throne Winning contests all alone
00:32 -- 00:39:  Sammie's heart was torn in twos Music now laced with blues
00:39 -- 00:46:  Oh, Sammie, why, oh, why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:46 -- 00:52:  Once you sang of love and light Now your song's biting the night
00:53 -- 01:02:  Raccoon band plays out of tune Since that fateful night in June
01:02 -- 01:08:  Howlin' cat's song took the crowd Left poor Sammie crying loud
01:08 -- 01:15:  Sammie's tunes have lost their glee Heartbreak under the willow tree
01:15 -- 01:22:  Ballads now with teeth and claws Raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:22 -- 01:29:  Oh, Sammie, why, oh, why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
01:29 -- 01:35:  Once you sang of love and light Now your song's biting the night
01:35 -- 01:51:  Moonlit alleys still remember Songs of love in soft September
01:51 -- 02:00:  Sammie sings with feral spite Turning love into a fight
02:05 -- 02:15:  Sammie sings with feral spite Turning love into a fight
