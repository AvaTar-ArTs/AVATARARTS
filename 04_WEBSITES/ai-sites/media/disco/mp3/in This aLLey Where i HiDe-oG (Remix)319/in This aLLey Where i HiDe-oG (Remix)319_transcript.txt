00:00 -- 00:26:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:26 -- 00:39:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:39 -- 00:42:  Darken nights I've always known
00:42 -- 01:00:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
01:00 -- 01:08:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
01:08 -- 01:25:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:25 -- 01:36:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:55 -- 02:06:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
02:06 -- 02:18:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
02:18 -- 02:31:  Now I howl a different tune No more kisses in the rain
02:31 -- 02:39:  No more songs without the pain Freedom found in broken chains
02:39 -- 02:52:  Raccoon heart beats gone insane No more love songs in the night
02:52 -- 03:08:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
03:08 -- 03:12:  In this alley where I hide
