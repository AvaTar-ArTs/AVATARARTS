00:00 -- 00:01:  Why?
00:01 -- 00:14:  In the shadows is where I prowl
00:14 -- 00:17:  Broken dreams like shattered glass
00:17 -- 00:18:  East of town
00:18 -- 00:21:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown
00:21 -- 00:25:  Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:25 -- 00:30:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
00:31 -- 00:36:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
00:36 -- 00:38:  By the fire's orange glow
00:38 -- 00:42:  Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:42 -- 00:45:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:45 -- 00:48:  Rusty hearts beating in sync wrapped in plastic wrap
00:48 -- 00:52:  We're royalty of refused love in a discarded map
00:52 -- 00:57:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
00:58 -- 01:03:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
01:03 -- 01:06:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:06 -- 01:09:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:09 -- 01:12:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:12 -- 01:16:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:16 -- 01:21:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
01:22 -- 01:27:  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
01:27 -- 01:30:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:30 -- 01:33:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:33 -- 01:36:  Stories of old starters told in street lamp waddles
01:36 -- 01:39:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:39 -- 01:42:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune
01:42 -- 01:45:  Alley symphony
01:45 -- 01:48:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind
01:48 -- 01:51:  Unchained
01:51 -- 01:53:  Free
01:53 -- 01:57:  No fancy words nor clean papers decree
01:57 -- 02:00:  In the trash we thrive
02:00 -- 02:03:  Hearts wild and debris
02:03 -- 02:06:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:06 -- 02:09:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:09 -- 02:12:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:12 -- 02:16:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:18 -- 02:21:  Go!
02:27 -- 02:30:  Go!
