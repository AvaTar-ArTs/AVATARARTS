00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town, we scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown.
00:16 -- 00:24:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:30 -- 00:56:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap, she hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:57 -- 01:14:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap, we're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:14 -- 01:29:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight, kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:29 -- 01:45:  With dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight, we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:45 -- 02:07:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles, we drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle, stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
02:08 -- 02:33:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle, the stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:34 -- 02:45:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree, in the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:46 -- 03:02:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight, kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
03:02 -- 03:18:  With dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight, we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
