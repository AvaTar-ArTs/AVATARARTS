00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass
00:15 -- 00:20:  East of town we scavenge treasure From the tale of the city's frown
00:20 -- 00:32:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:32 -- 00:39:  By the fire's orange glow Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:39 -- 00:48:  She hums the blues Of a life caught in the traps
00:48 -- 00:53:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
00:53 -- 01:01:  We're royalty of refuse love In a discarded map
01:01 -- 01:05:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:05 -- 01:09:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:09 -- 01:13:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:13 -- 01:21:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
01:21 -- 01:24:  Her eyes are diamonds Among the broken bottles
01:24 -- 01:28:  We drink cheap wine From a paper bag throttle
01:28 -- 01:33:  Stories of old stardust Told in street lamp waddles
01:33 -- 01:36:  With every beat from the drum Of an empty milk bottle
01:38 -- 01:40:  The stray dogs bark A mournful tune
01:40 -- 01:44:  Alley symphony Our romance is feral
01:44 -- 01:47:  Wild as the wind Unchained, free
01:47 -- 01:51:  No fancy words Nor clean papers decree
01:51 -- 01:55:  In the trash we thrive Hearts wild and free
01:58 -- 02:01:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:03 -- 02:05:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
02:06 -- 02:10:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
02:10 -- 02:30:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
02:33 -- 02:35:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:35 -- 02:37:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
