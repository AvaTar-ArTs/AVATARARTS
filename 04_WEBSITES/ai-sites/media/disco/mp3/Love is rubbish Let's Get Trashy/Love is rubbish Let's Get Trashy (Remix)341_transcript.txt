00:00 -- 00:22:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass
00:22 -- 00:29:  East of town We scavenge treasure from the tail of the
00:29 -- 00:36:  city's frown Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile
00:36 -- 00:37:  howl
00:37 -- 00:50:  By the fire's orange glow Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:50 -- 00:56:  She hums the blues of life Caught in the traps
00:56 -- 01:02:  Rusty hearts beating and sing Wrapped in plastic wrap
01:02 -- 01:08:  We're royalty of refuse Love in a discarded map
01:08 -- 01:15:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:15 -- 01:21:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:21 -- 01:27:  We're dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:27 -- 01:31:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:45 -- 02:03:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
02:03 -- 02:08:  Stories of old stardust told in streetlamp waddles
02:08 -- 02:14:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
02:16 -- 02:23:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune Alley symphony
02:24 -- 02:30:  Our romance is feral Wild as the wind
02:31 -- 02:33:  Unchained
02:34 -- 02:39:  Freed no fancy words No clean papers decree
02:40 -- 02:45:  In the trash we thrive Hearts wild and debris
02:46 -- 02:51:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:53 -- 02:57:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:57 -- 03:05:  We're dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
03:05 -- 03:09:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
03:27 -- 03:37:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
