00:00 -- 00:10:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass
00:10 -- 00:19:  East of town, we scavenge treasure From the tale of the city's frown
00:19 -- 00:29:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:29 -- 00:50:  Violet fires, orange glow Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:50 -- 00:54:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:54 -- 01:00:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
01:00 -- 01:08:  We're royalty of refuse Love in a discarded map
01:08 -- 01:13:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:13 -- 01:20:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:20 -- 01:25:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:25 -- 01:37:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:37 -- 01:41:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:41 -- 01:45:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:45 -- 01:49:  Stories of old stardust toting street lamp waddles
01:49 -- 01:57:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:57 -- 02:02:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune
02:02 -- 02:08:  Alley symphony, our romance is feral
02:08 -- 02:14:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free
02:14 -- 02:24:  No fancy words, no clean papers decree In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:24 -- 02:29:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:29 -- 02:36:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
02:36 -- 02:41:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
02:41 -- 02:46:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
