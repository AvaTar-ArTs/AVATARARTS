00:00 -- 00:25:  In the shadows where our cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass. East of town, we scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown. Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:30 -- 00:56:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap. She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:57 -- 01:14:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap. We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:15 -- 01:29:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight. Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:29 -- 01:45:  With dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight. We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:45 -- 02:07:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles. We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle. Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
02:08 -- 02:32:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle. The stray dogs bark a mournful tune. Alley symphony, our romance is feral. Wild is the wind, unchained, free.
02:33 -- 02:45:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree. In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:46 -- 03:02:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight. Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
03:02 -- 03:18:  With dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight. We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
