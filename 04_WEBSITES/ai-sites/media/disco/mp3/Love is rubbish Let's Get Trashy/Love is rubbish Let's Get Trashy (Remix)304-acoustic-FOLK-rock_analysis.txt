The song embraces an unorthodox romance, both gritty and vibrant, reflecting the raw and unpolished emotions of its subjects.

### Narrative Arc

The narrative arc follows the transformation of desolation into a unique form of regality. It begins in the shadows, moves through the collection of urban debris, and culminates in a self-proclaimed royalty of "litter."

### Interplay Between Visuals and Audio

The acoustic folk-rock elements of the song provide a raw, organic sound that aligns with the gritty visuals, while the remix element might introduce an unexpected, modern twist. The audio storytelling through rhythmic beats, such as the "drum of an empty milk bottle," creates a vivid soundscape of the environment, enhancing the narrative's authenticity.
