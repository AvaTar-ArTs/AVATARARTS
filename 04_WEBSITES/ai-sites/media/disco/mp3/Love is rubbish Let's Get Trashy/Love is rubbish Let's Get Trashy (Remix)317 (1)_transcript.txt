00:00 -- 00:09:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town.
00:09 -- 00:15:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown.
00:15 -- 00:24:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:24 -- 00:25:  Ooh!
00:42 -- 00:50:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:50 -- 00:57:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:57 -- 01:05:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap.
01:05 -- 01:13:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:13 -- 01:21:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:21 -- 01:30:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:30 -- 01:38:  We're dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight.
01:38 -- 01:51:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:51 -- 01:55:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles.
01:55 -- 01:59:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:59 -- 02:06:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
02:06 -- 02:17:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
02:17 -- 02:24:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony.
02:24 -- 02:32:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:32 -- 02:37:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree.
02:37 -- 02:44:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:44 -- 02:52:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:52 -- 02:58:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
03:02 -- 03:09:  We're dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight.
03:09 -- 03:16:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
