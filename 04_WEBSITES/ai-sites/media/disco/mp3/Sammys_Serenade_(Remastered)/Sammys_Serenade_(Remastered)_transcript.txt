00:00 -- 00:07:  Sammie sang in moonlit nights
00:07 -- 00:11:  With raccoon band and alley lights
00:11 -- 00:16:  Love ballad soft in the dark
00:16 -- 00:23:  Till one night love left a mark
00:23 -- 00:27:  Howlin' Cat took Sammie's throne
00:27 -- 00:32:  Winning contest all alone
00:32 -- 00:36:  Sammie's heart was torn in twos
00:36 -- 00:40:  Music now laced with blues
00:40 -- 00:44:  Oh Sammie, why oh why
00:44 -- 00:48:  Did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:48 -- 00:53:  Once you sang of love and light
00:53 -- 00:57:  Now your songs bite in the night
00:57 -- 01:02:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
01:02 -- 01:06:  Since that fateful night in June
01:06 -- 01:10:  Howlin' Cat's song took the crowd
01:10 -- 01:17:  Left poor Sammie crying loud
01:17 -- 01:21:  Sammie's tunes have lost their glee
01:21 -- 01:25:  Heartbreak under the willow tree
01:25 -- 01:29:  Ballads now with teeth and claws
01:29 -- 01:33:  Raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:33 -- 01:38:  Moonlit alleys still remember
01:38 -- 01:42:  Songs of love in soft September
01:42 -- 01:47:  Sammie sings with feral spite
01:47 -- 01:51:  Turning love into a fight
01:51 -- 02:09:  . . .
02:09 -- 02:26:  . . .
02:26 -- 02:30:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
02:30 -- 02:34:  Since that fateful night in June
02:34 -- 02:38:  Howlin' Cat's song took the crowd
02:38 -- 02:43:  Left poor Sammie crying loud
02:43 -- 02:47:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
02:47 -- 02:51:  Since that fateful night in June
02:51 -- 02:55:  Howlin' Cat's song took the crowd
02:55 -- 03:00:  Left poor Sammie crying loud
03:00 -- 03:05:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
03:05 -- 03:09:  Since that fateful night in June
03:09 -- 03:13:  Howlin' Cat's song took the crowd
03:13 -- 03:19:  Left poor Sammie crying loud
03:19 -- 03:23:  Sammie's tunes have lost their glee
03:23 -- 03:27:  Heartbreak under the willow tree
03:27 -- 03:31:  Ballads now with teeth and claws
03:31 -- 03:35:  Raccoons play with hidden flaws
03:35 -- 03:40:  Moonlit alleys still remember
03:40 -- 03:44:  Songs of love in soft September
03:44 -- 03:48:  Sammie sings with feral spite
03:48 -- 03:51:  Turning love into a fight
