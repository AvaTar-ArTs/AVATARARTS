00:00 -- 00:13:  Moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:13 -- 00:26:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:26 -- 00:39:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:39 -- 00:50:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
00:50 -- 01:02:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:02 -- 01:16:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:16 -- 01:29:  Tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:29 -- 01:40:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:40 -- 01:53:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
01:53 -- 02:05:  Freedom found in broken chains Reckoned heartbeats gone insane
02:05 -- 02:18:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:18 -- 02:34:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:34 -- 02:47:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:47 -- 03:02:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
03:02 -- 03:08:  In this alley where I hide
