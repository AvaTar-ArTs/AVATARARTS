00:00 -- 00:05:  In the shadows where the otter cats prowl
00:05 -- 00:10:  Broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town
00:10 -- 00:16:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown
00:16 -- 00:20:  Live fast, eat trash
00:20 -- 00:25:  Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:30 -- 00:46:  By the fire's orange glow
00:46 -- 00:50:  Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:50 -- 00:58:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:58 -- 01:01:  Rusty hearts beating in sync
01:01 -- 01:06:  Wrapped in plastic wrap
01:06 -- 01:10:  We're royalty of refuse
01:10 -- 01:14:  Love in a discarded map
01:14 -- 01:16:  Love is rubbish
01:16 -- 01:22:  Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:22 -- 01:26:  Kings and queens of litter
01:26 -- 01:31:  In the city's blight
01:31 -- 01:35:  With dumpsters for a throne
01:35 -- 01:39:  And cans filled with delight
01:39 -- 01:52:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:52 -- 01:57:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:57 -- 02:01:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
02:01 -- 02:08:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles
02:08 -- 02:18:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
02:18 -- 02:22:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune
02:22 -- 02:27:  Alley symphony, our romance is feral
02:27 -- 02:33:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free
02:33 -- 02:38:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree
02:38 -- 02:46:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:46 -- 02:48:  Love is rubbish
02:48 -- 02:54:  Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:54 -- 02:58:  Kings and queens of litter
02:58 -- 03:03:  In the city's blight
03:03 -- 03:07:  With dumpsters for a throne
03:07 -- 03:11:  And cans filled with delight
03:11 -- 03:17:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
