00:00 -- 00:05:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing
00:05 -- 00:09:  Now I roam these streets alone
00:09 -- 00:13:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings
00:13 -- 00:19:  Darken nights I've always known
00:19 -- 00:23:  Love was sweet but now it's gone
00:23 -- 00:27:  Echoes of the distant June
00:27 -- 00:31:  Hollycat took my song
00:31 -- 00:35:  Left me with this heavy gloom
00:37 -- 00:40:  Wrote all love songs in the night
00:40 -- 00:44:  All the echoes of our fight
00:44 -- 00:48:  Broken dreams they scatter white
00:48 -- 00:54:  In this alley where I hide
00:58 -- 01:05:  I tried to win your heart in vain
01:05 -- 01:09:  Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:09 -- 01:13:  But your love was just a chain
01:13 -- 01:17:  Now I have a different tune
01:19 -- 01:23:  No more kisses in the rain
01:23 -- 01:27:  No more souls without the pain
01:27 -- 01:31:  Freedom found in broken chains
01:31 -- 01:36:  Wreck of heartbeats gone insane
01:36 -- 01:50:  Instrumental
01:50 -- 01:54:  Wrote all love songs in the night
01:54 -- 01:58:  All the echoes of our fight
01:58 -- 02:02:  Broken dreams they scatter white
02:02 -- 02:08:  In this alley where I hide
