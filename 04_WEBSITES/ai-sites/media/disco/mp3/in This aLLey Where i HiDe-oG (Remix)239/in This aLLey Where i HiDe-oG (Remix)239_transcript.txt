00:00 -- 00:19:  Moonlit alleys we used to sing, now I roam these streets alone
00:20 -- 00:30:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings, darker nights I've always known
00:33 -- 00:43:  Love was sweet but now it's gone, echoes of a distant tune
00:44 -- 00:55:  Left me with this heavy gloom, no more love songs in the night
00:56 -- 01:07:  Only echoes of our fights, broken dreams they scatter white
01:08 -- 01:20:  In this alley where I hide, I tried to win your heart in vain
01:21 -- 01:32:  Sung my soul beneath the moon, but your love was just a chain
01:32 -- 01:38:  Now I howl a different tune
01:39 -- 01:51:  No more kisses in the rain, songs now laced with the pain
01:52 -- 02:04:  Freedom found in broken chains, walk on mad knees long and sad
02:05 -- 02:16:  No more love songs in the night, only echoes of our fights
02:16 -- 02:29:  Broken dreams they scatter white, in this alley where I hide
