00:00 -- 00:18:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass, east of
00:18 -- 00:23:  town We scavenge treasure from the tail of the
00:23 -- 00:29:  city's frown Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's
00:29 -- 00:40:  hostile howl By the fire a zoran's glow
00:40 -- 00:46:  Our kingdom rises from the scrap She hums the blue of a life caught in the
00:46 -- 00:52:  traps Rusty hearts beaten in sync, wrapped in plastic
00:53 -- 01:00:  We're royalty of a refused love and a discarded map
01:00 -- 01:06:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:06 -- 01:11:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:11 -- 01:18:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:18 -- 01:24:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:29 -- 01:34:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:34 -- 01:40:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:40 -- 01:45:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles
01:45 -- 01:51:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:55 -- 02:00:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune
02:00 -- 02:11:  Alley symphony, our romance is feral Wild as the wind, unchained, free
02:12 -- 02:17:  No fancy words nor clean papers to creep
02:17 -- 02:23:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:27 -- 02:33:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:33 -- 02:39:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:39 -- 02:45:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:48 -- 02:55:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
