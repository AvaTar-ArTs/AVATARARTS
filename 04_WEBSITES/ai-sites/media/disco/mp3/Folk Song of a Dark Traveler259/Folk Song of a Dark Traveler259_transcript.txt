00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine. I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine.
00:21 -- 00:33:  Primal night, give it sight. Familiar by thy sight. If sun be gone, we carry on. Spirited, unsullied.
00:34 -- 00:56:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road.
00:57 -- 01:09:  At the ends of earth, we rise. Crossover through the realms, we fly.
01:09 -- 01:23:  Lost soul in my arms, show me your scars. In this, we're alive.
01:24 -- 01:36:  No wrong, no right. In this, we're alive.
01:37 -- 02:00:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road.
02:01 -- 02:14:  Take my hand and abide, over mauling to the sun. All the braces out I feel, is spitting me against the sun.
02:14 -- 02:27:  Broken hearts do the work, finals all the way hurt. Broken hearts do the work, finals all the way hurt.
02:27 -- 02:51:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road.
02:57 -- 02:59:  Thanks for watching!
