00:00 -- 00:19:  Marching ever forward neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's
00:19 -- 00:26:  hand in mine Primal night, give it sight
00:26 -- 00:32:  Familiar by thy side, if sun be gone we carry on
00:32 -- 00:41:  Spirit as our guide Down, down, down the road, down the witch's
00:41 -- 00:48:  road Down, down, down the road, down the witch's
00:48 -- 00:54:  road Down, down, down the road, down the witch's
00:54 -- 01:04:  road Gently into the black, hushed and silent
01:04 -- 01:12:  sea Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:12 -- 01:22:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand Hold on fast, moon above, be our guide
01:22 -- 01:31:  Bring us safely to our side, take my hand On we march, if I fall, leave me there
01:31 -- 01:40:  Moon above, be our guide Bring us safely to our side
01:40 -- 01:53:  And the hollow echoes With the past lives of our souls
01:53 -- 02:06:  We will walk this earth forever Until the earth reclaims our bones
02:06 -- 02:18:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
02:18 -- 02:28:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
02:28 -- 02:36:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
