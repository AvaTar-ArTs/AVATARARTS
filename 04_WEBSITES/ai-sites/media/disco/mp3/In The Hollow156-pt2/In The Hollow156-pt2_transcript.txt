00:00 -- 00:25:  Marching ever forward, beneath the wooded shrine, I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine.
00:26 -- 00:38:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight, if some be gone we carry on, spirit as our guide.
00:39 -- 01:03:  Gently into the black, hushed and silent sea, silent as the voice who cries to be free.
01:04 -- 01:28:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand, hold on fast, moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight.
01:28 -- 01:53:  Take my hand, on we march, if I fall, leave me there, moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight.
