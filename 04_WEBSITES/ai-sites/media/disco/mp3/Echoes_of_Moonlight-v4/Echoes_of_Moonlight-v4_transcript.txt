00:00 -- 00:12:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:12 -- 00:21:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:21 -- 00:30:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:30 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
00:39 -- 00:48:  No more love songs in the night
00:48 -- 01:03:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter wide
01:03 -- 01:15:  In this alley where I hide I tried to win your heart in vain
01:15 -- 01:23:  You sung my soul beneath the moon But your love was just a chain
01:23 -- 01:31:  Now I howl a different tune No more kisses in the rain
01:31 -- 01:40:  No more songs without the pain Freedom found in broken chains
01:40 -- 01:55:  Raccoon heartbeats gone insane No more love songs in the night
01:55 -- 02:10:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter wide
02:10 -- 02:15:  In this alley where I hide
02:25 -- 02:45:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:45 -- 02:57:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
03:15 -- 03:20:  In this alley where I hide
