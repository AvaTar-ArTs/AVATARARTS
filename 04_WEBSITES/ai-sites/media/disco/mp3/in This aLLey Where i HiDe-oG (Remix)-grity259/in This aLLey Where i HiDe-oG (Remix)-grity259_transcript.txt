00:00 -- 00:18:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:18 -- 00:28:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:30 -- 00:40:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:40 -- 00:47:  Left me with this heavy gloom
00:47 -- 00:57:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
00:57 -- 01:07:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
01:27 -- 01:40:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:40 -- 01:52:  But your love was just a chain Now I have a different tune
01:52 -- 02:02:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now lace with the pain
02:02 -- 02:09:  Freedom found in broken chains
02:09 -- 02:18:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:18 -- 02:27:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
02:48 -- 02:58:  Thanks for watching!
