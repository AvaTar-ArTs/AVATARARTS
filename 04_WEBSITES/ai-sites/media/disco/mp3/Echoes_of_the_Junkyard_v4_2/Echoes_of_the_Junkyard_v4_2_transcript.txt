00:00 -- 00:12:  Born among the scrap, in the rust and the dust
00:12 -- 00:19:  He found his melody in the things left lost
00:19 -- 00:26:  Strings of wire tight, cans and old wood blocks
00:26 -- 00:32:  He played his heart out with the rhythm of the clocks
00:32 -- 00:38:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
00:38 -- 00:46:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
00:46 -- 00:52:  People gathered round to hear his junkyard song
00:52 -- 00:58:  A spark of wonder found in the beat so strong
00:58 -- 01:04:  When shadows tried to take the home he loved and knew
01:04 -- 01:12:  He strummed louder for their sake, inspiring hearts anew
01:12 -- 01:18:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
01:19 -- 01:25:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
01:38 -- 01:44:  People gathered round to hear his junkyard song
01:44 -- 01:50:  A spark of wonder found in the beat so strong
01:50 -- 01:56:  When shadows tried to take the home he loved and knew
01:56 -- 02:04:  He strummed louder for their sake, inspiring hearts anew
02:04 -- 02:10:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
02:10 -- 02:16:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
