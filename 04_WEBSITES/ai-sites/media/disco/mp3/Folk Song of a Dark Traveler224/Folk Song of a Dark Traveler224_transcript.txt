00:00 -- 00:22:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine, I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine.
00:22 -- 00:35:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight, if sun be gone, we carry on, spirit ends all die.
00:35 -- 00:59:  Down, down, down the low, down the witches grow.
00:59 -- 01:17:  At the ends of earth we rise, cross over through the rails we fly.
01:18 -- 01:44:  Lost soul in my arms, show me your scars, in this we're alike, no wrong or right, in this we're alike.
01:44 -- 02:13:  Spirit lead the way through darkened skies, don't look back and don't ask why, the only thing I need tonight is you and I.
02:14 -- 02:24:  Spirit lead the way through darkened skies, don't look back and don't ask why, the only thing I need tonight is you and I.
