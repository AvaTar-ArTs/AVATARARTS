00:00 -- 00:27:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:27 -- 00:40:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:40 -- 00:52:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:52 -- 01:07:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
01:07 -- 01:20:  Only echoes of our fights Broken dreams they scatter white
01:20 -- 01:26:  In this alley where I hide
01:38 -- 01:50:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:50 -- 02:02:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
02:02 -- 02:15:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now lace with the pain
02:15 -- 02:28:  Freedom found in broken chains Lack of what's been stolen safe
02:28 -- 02:40:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
02:40 -- 02:52:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:58 -- 03:08:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
03:08 -- 03:18:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
