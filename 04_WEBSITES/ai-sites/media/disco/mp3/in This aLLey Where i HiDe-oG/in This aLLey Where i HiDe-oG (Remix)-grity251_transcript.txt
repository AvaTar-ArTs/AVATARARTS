00:00 -- 00:24:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:24 -- 00:32:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:32 -- 00:40:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:40 -- 00:53:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
00:53 -- 01:09:  Only echoes of our fights Broken dreams, they scatter wide
01:09 -- 01:18:  In this alley where I hide
01:18 -- 01:26:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:26 -- 01:33:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:33 -- 01:41:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now laced with the pain
01:41 -- 01:55:  Freedom found in broken chains No more love songs in the night
01:55 -- 02:10:  Only echoes of our fights Broken dreams, they scatter wide
02:10 -- 02:16:  In this alley where I hide
