00:00 -- 00:26:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:26 -- 00:36:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:36 -- 00:45:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:45 -- 00:58:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
00:58 -- 01:07:  Only echoes of our fights Broken dreams they scatter white
01:07 -- 01:20:  In this alley where I hide
01:20 -- 01:30:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:30 -- 01:39:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:39 -- 01:48:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now lace with the pain
01:48 -- 01:57:  Freedom found in broken chains
01:57 -- 02:06:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
02:06 -- 02:15:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:27 -- 02:37:  Thanks for watching!
