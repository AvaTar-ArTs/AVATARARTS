00:00 -- 00:17:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:17 -- 00:29:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:29 -- 00:34:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:34 -- 00:45:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
00:45 -- 00:51:  Only echoes of our fights Broken dreams they scatter white
00:51 -- 01:11:  In this alley where I hide I tried to win your heart in vain
01:11 -- 01:17:  Sung my soul beneath the moon But your love was just a chain
01:17 -- 01:28:  Now I howl a different tune No more kisses in the rain
01:28 -- 01:39:  Songs now laced with the pain Freedom found in broken chains
01:39 -- 01:45:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
01:45 -- 01:52:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:52 -- 01:58:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
01:58 -- 02:05:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:05 -- 02:32:  Where I hide
02:35 -- 02:46:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:46 -- 02:55:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
