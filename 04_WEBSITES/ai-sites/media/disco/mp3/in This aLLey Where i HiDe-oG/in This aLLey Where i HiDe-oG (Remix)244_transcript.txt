00:00 -- 00:25:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:25 -- 00:35:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:35 -- 00:49:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:49 -- 01:00:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
01:00 -- 01:12:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:12 -- 01:25:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:25 -- 01:38:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:38 -- 01:48:  Thought your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:48 -- 02:01:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
02:01 -- 02:13:  Freedom found in broken chains Raccoon heartbeats gone insane
02:13 -- 02:25:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:25 -- 02:36:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
