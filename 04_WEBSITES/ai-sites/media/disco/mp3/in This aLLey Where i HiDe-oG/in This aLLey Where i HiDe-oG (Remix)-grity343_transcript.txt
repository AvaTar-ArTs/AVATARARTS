00:00 -- 00:20:  In the shadows where the darkness prowls, broken dreams and shattered glass
00:20 -- 00:25:  East of town
00:25 -- 00:30:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown
00:30 -- 00:36:  Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile hour
00:36 -- 00:55:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:55 -- 01:01:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
01:01 -- 01:07:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap
01:07 -- 01:13:  We're royalty of refuse love in a discarded map
01:13 -- 01:20:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:20 -- 01:25:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:25 -- 01:31:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:31 -- 01:51:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:51 -- 01:57:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:57 -- 02:03:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
02:03 -- 02:08:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles
02:08 -- 02:15:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
02:15 -- 02:21:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony
02:21 -- 02:27:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind
02:27 -- 02:33:  Unchained, free, no fancy words nor clean papers decree
02:33 -- 02:39:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:39 -- 02:46:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:46 -- 02:51:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:51 -- 02:58:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:58 -- 03:03:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
