00:00 -- 00:28:  In the shadows where the darkness prowls
00:28 -- 00:31:  Broken dreams in shattered glass east of town
00:31 -- 00:34:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of cities frowned
00:34 -- 00:38:  Live fast, eat trash, meet the moon's hostile howl
00:38 -- 00:41:  By the fire's orange glow our kingdom rises from the scraps
00:41 -- 00:45:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:45 -- 00:47:  Rusty hearts beat in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap
00:47 -- 00:51:  We're royalty, a refuge, love in a discarded map
00:53 -- 00:58:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
00:59 -- 01:05:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:05 -- 01:11:  We're dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:11 -- 01:17:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:21 -- 01:25:  Horizon diamonds among the broken bottles
01:25 -- 01:28:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:28 -- 01:31:  Stories of old starters told in streetlamp waddles
01:31 -- 01:34:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:34 -- 01:40:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral
01:40 -- 01:42:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free
01:42 -- 01:45:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree
01:45 -- 01:50:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
01:50 -- 01:57:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:59 -- 02:04:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:05 -- 02:10:  We're dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:11 -- 02:16:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:21 -- 02:27:  We're dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:27 -- 02:34:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:34 -- 02:40:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:40 -- 02:46:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:50 -- 02:54:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
