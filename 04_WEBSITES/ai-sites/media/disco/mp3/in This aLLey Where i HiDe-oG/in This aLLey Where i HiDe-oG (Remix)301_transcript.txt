00:00 -- 00:29:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing, Now I roam these streets alone,
00:30 -- 00:39:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings, Darker nights I've always known,
00:43 -- 00:52:  Love was sweet but now it's gone, Echoes of a distant tune,
00:53 -- 01:02:  Howling cat took my song, Left me with this heavy gloom,
01:06 -- 01:15:  No more love songs in the night, Only echoes of our fight,
01:16 -- 01:25:  Broken dreams they scatter white, In this alley where I hide,
01:29 -- 01:38:  I tried to win your heart in vain, Sung my soul beneath the moon,
01:39 -- 01:48:  But your love was just a chain, Now I howl a different tune,
01:52 -- 02:01:  No more kisses in the rain, No more songs without the pain,
02:01 -- 02:12:  Freedom found in broken chains, Raccoon heartbeats gone insane,
02:31 -- 02:45:  No more love songs in the night, Only echoes of our fight,
02:46 -- 02:56:  Broken dreams they scatter white, In this alley where I hide,
