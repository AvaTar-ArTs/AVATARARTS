00:00 -- 00:26:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:26 -- 00:39:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:39 -- 00:51:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:51 -- 01:05:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
01:05 -- 01:18:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
01:18 -- 01:30:  In this alley where I hide I tried to win your heart in vain
01:30 -- 01:43:  Sung my soul beneath the moon But your love was just a chain
01:43 -- 01:55:  Now I howl of different tune No more kisses in the rain
01:55 -- 02:08:  No more songs in the pain Freedom found in broken chains
02:08 -- 02:21:  Laugh though nothing's gone insane No more love songs in the night
02:21 -- 02:34:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
02:34 -- 02:50:  In this alley where I hide No more love songs in the night
02:50 -- 03:02:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
03:02 -- 03:08:  In this alley where I hide
03:20 -- 03:30:  Thanks for watching!
