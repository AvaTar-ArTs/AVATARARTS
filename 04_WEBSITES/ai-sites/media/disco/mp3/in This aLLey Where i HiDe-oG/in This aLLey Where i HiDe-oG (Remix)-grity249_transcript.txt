00:00 -- 00:18:  In the shadows where the darkness prowls, broken dreams in shattered glass, east of town.
00:18 -- 00:25:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown,
00:25 -- 00:31:  we live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:31 -- 00:42:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:42 -- 00:49:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps,
00:49 -- 00:54:  trusty hearts beaten in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap.
00:54 -- 01:00:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:00 -- 01:07:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:07 -- 01:12:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight,
01:12 -- 01:18:  with dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight.
01:18 -- 01:26:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:26 -- 01:32:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles,
01:32 -- 01:38:  we drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:38 -- 01:44:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles,
01:44 -- 01:51:  with every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
01:51 -- 01:57:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony.
01:57 -- 02:02:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind.
02:02 -- 02:13:  Unchained, free, no fancy words nor clean papers decree.
02:13 -- 02:20:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:20 -- 02:27:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:27 -- 02:32:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight,
02:32 -- 02:37:  with dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight.
02:37 -- 02:49:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
