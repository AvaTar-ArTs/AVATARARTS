00:00 -- 00:22:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:22 -- 00:33:  Beneath the stars my heart, it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:33 -- 00:43:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:43 -- 00:54:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
00:54 -- 01:04:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:04 -- 01:14:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:14 -- 01:35:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:36 -- 01:46:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:46 -- 01:58:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
01:58 -- 02:09:  Freedom found in broken chains Raccoon heartbeats gone insane
02:09 -- 02:29:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:29 -- 02:40:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
