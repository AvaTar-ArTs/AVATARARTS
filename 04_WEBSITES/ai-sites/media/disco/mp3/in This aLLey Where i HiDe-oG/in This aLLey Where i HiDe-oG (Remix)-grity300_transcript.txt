00:00 -- 00:22:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:23 -- 00:33:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:35 -- 00:44:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:45 -- 00:50:  Left me with this heavy bloom
00:54 -- 01:03:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
01:03 -- 01:14:  Broken dreams they scattered wild In this alley where I hide
01:17 -- 01:27:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:28 -- 01:38:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:40 -- 01:49:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now laced with the pain
01:50 -- 01:55:  Freedom found in broken chains
01:59 -- 02:08:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fights
02:08 -- 02:19:  Broken dreams they scattered wild In this alley where I hide
02:38 -- 02:48:  Thanks for watching!
