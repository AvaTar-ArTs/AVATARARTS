00:14 -- 00:21:  🎵 Moonlit valleys callin' Willow trees sway slow 🎵
00:21 -- 00:28:  🎵 Heartbreak like a whisper In the still of night it grows 🎵
00:28 -- 00:35:  🎵 Once was joy and mourning Now the shadows cast so deep 🎵
00:35 -- 00:42:  🎵 Echoes of the laughter Fill the spaces in between 🎵
00:42 -- 00:49:  🎵 A long time comin' Our minds couldn't change 🎵
00:49 -- 00:56:  🎵 Can't keep on runnin' It's the time to break away 🎵
00:56 -- 01:03:  🎵 Rivers rushing forward Swallowed by the tide 🎵
01:03 -- 01:10:  🎵 Wildflowers bloomin' On the other side 🎵
01:10 -- 01:17:  🎵 I will find my solace In the places left behind 🎵
01:17 -- 01:24:  🎵 Echoes of the laughter In the moments of time 🎵
01:24 -- 01:31:  🎵 A long time comin' Our minds couldn't change 🎵
01:31 -- 01:38:  🎵 Can't keep on runnin' It's the time to break away 🎵

02:00 -- 02:07:  🎵 Wildflowers bloomin' On the other side 🎵
02:07 -- 02:14:  🎵 I will find my solace In the places left behind 🎵
