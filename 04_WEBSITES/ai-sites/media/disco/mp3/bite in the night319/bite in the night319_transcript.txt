00:00 -- 00:17:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights, with raccoon bed and alley lights
00:17 -- 00:23:  Love ballad soft in the dark, till one night love left a mark
00:23 -- 00:29:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone
00:29 -- 00:37:  Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues
00:37 -- 00:43:  Sammy, why did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:43 -- 00:49:  Once you sang of love and light, now your song's biting in the night
00:49 -- 01:01:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
01:01 -- 01:07:  Raccoon bed plays out of tunes since that fateful night in June
01:07 -- 01:13:  Howling cat's song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud
01:13 -- 01:18:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree
01:18 -- 01:26:  Ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:26 -- 01:32:  Oh, Sammy, where, oh, where did the alley cat steal your sky?
01:32 -- 01:38:  Once you sang of love and light, now your song's bright in the night
01:38 -- 01:47:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
02:01 -- 02:07:  Won't let alley still remember songs of love in soft September
02:07 -- 02:14:  All these things with their own spite, turning love into a fight
02:17 -- 02:22:  Tell me why, oh why did the alley cat steal your sky?
02:23 -- 02:28:  Once you sang of love in light, now your song's burning in the night
02:29 -- 02:36:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
02:38 -- 02:45:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
02:46 -- 02:51:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
02:52 -- 02:54:  What the hell did the sunlight steal?
02:54 -- 03:00:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
03:00 -- 03:13:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
03:13 -- 03:20:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ...
03:21 -- 03:23:  Finally, we're free
