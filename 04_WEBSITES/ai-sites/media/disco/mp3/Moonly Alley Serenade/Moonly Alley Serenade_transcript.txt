00:47 -- 00:55:  Heart and soul in every beat Sammy's tune, bittersweet
00:55 -- 01:02:  Each corner holds a ghostly dream Melody, we scream, we scream
01:02 -- 01:09:  Broken hearts play on the strings Words of love and broken things
01:09 -- 01:15:  In the shadows, memories stay Howling cat, the doozy sway
01:15 -- 01:22:  We're sick that we can't erase Moonlit alleys, do we care?
