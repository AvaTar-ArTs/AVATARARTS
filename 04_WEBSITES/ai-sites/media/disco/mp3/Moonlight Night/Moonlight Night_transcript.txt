00:00 -- 00:05:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights
00:05 -- 00:10:  With raccoon band and alley lights
00:10 -- 00:14:  Love ballad soft in the dark
00:14 -- 00:20:  Till one night love left a mark
00:20 -- 00:25:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne
00:25 -- 00:30:  Winning contest all alone
00:30 -- 00:34:  Sammy's heart was torn in twos
00:34 -- 00:38:  Music now laced with blues
00:38 -- 00:43:  Oh, Sammy, why, oh, why
00:43 -- 00:48:  Did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:48 -- 00:52:  Once you sang of love and light
00:52 -- 00:57:  Now your songs bite in the night
00:57 -- 01:02:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
01:02 -- 01:06:  Since that fateful night in June
01:06 -- 01:10:  Howling cat song took the crowd
01:10 -- 01:14:  Left poor Sammy crying loud
01:14 -- 01:19:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
01:19 -- 01:23:  Since that fateful night in June
01:23 -- 01:27:  Howling cat song took the crowd
01:27 -- 01:32:  Left poor Sammy crying loud
01:32 -- 01:36:  Sammy's tunes had lost their glee
01:36 -- 01:40:  Heartbreak under the willow tree
01:40 -- 01:44:  Ballads now with teeth and claws
01:44 -- 01:49:  Raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:49 -- 01:53:  Moonlit alleys still remember
01:53 -- 01:58:  Songs of love in soft September
01:58 -- 02:02:  Sammy sings with feral spite
02:02 -- 02:06:  Turning love into a fight
02:14 -- 02:19:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
02:19 -- 02:24:  Raccoon band plays out of tune
02:40 -- 02:45:  Turning love into a fight
02:49 -- 02:54:  Turning love into a fight
