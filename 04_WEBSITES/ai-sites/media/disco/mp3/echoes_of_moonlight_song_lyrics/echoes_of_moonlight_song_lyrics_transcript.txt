00:00 -- 00:12:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:12 -- 00:21:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:21 -- 00:30:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:30 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
00:39 -- 00:56:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
00:56 -- 01:09:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
01:09 -- 01:19:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:19 -- 01:27:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:27 -- 01:35:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
01:35 -- 01:46:  Freedom found in broken chains Raccoon heartbeats gone insane
01:46 -- 02:03:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:03 -- 02:14:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
02:14 -- 02:43:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:43 -- 02:57:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
03:13 -- 03:15:  Thanks for watching!
