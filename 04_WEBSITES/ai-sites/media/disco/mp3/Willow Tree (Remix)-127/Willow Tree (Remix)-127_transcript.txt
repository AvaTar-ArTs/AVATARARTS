00:00 -- 00:07:  Moonlit valleys callin', willow trees sway slow
00:07 -- 00:14:  Heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night it grows
00:14 -- 00:21:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:21 -- 00:27:  Echoes of the laughter fill the spaces in between
00:27 -- 00:34:  A long time comin', our minds couldn't change
00:34 -- 00:41:  Can't keep on runnin', it's the time to break away
00:41 -- 00:48:  Rivers rushin' forward, swallowed by the tide
00:48 -- 00:55:  Wildflowers bloomin' on the other side
00:55 -- 01:02:  I will find my solace in the places left behind
01:02 -- 01:09:  Echoes of the laughter and the moments out of time
01:09 -- 01:16:  A long time comin', our minds couldn't change
01:16 -- 01:23:  Can't keep on runnin', it's the time to break away
01:25 -- 01:30:  Thanks for watching!
