00:00 -- 00:05:  City is black out, it's dark and bold, raccoons gather, storm is told
00:05 -- 00:11:  Trashcats come and raise a cheer, dumpster brew is always near
00:21 -- 00:26:  Grungy nights where shadows play, underneath the moon we sway
00:26 -- 00:31:  Toasted hands and laughter roars, life is found among the scores
00:31 -- 00:36:  Dumpster fire, happy hour, raccoons sing, we feel the power
00:36 -- 00:41:  Trashcats run with dreams so high, underneath this city sky
00:41 -- 00:46:  Fizzy brew and cans collide, in this place we won't divide
00:46 -- 00:51:  Unity in trash we see, brothers, sisters, wild and free
00:56 -- 01:01:  Violent whispers, joy and peace, in the climb we find release
01:01 -- 01:06:  Here's to life in alleys dark, here's our flame that leaves a mark
01:11 -- 01:16:  Dumpster fire, happy hour, raccoons sing, we feel the power
01:16 -- 01:21:  Trashcats run with dreams so high, underneath this city sky
01:21 -- 01:31:  Dumpster fire, happy hour, raccoons sing, we feel the power
01:31 -- 01:36:  Trashcats run with dreams so high, underneath this city sky
01:36 -- 01:41:  This city sky
01:52 -- 01:57:  Fizzy brew and cans collide, in this place we feel the power
01:57 -- 02:02:  Trashcats roll with dreams so high, underneath this city sky
02:02 -- 02:12:  Dumpster fire, happy hour, raccoons sing, we feel the power
02:12 -- 02:17:  Trashcats roll with dreams so high, underneath this city sky
02:18 -- 02:22:  This city sky
02:32 -- 02:37:  Fizzy brew and cans collide, in this place we won't divide
02:37 -- 02:42:  Unity in trash we see, brothers, sisters, wild and free
