[0.00 - 16.38]  In an alley where shadows dance with spurs of lost romance
[16.38 - 22.00]  Failed light from a dying moon
[22.00 - 28.46]  Strums of a haunted tune Old guitar Strings one thing
[28.46 - 30.94]  Wait by ghosts that might have been
[30.94 - 35.46]  The night went in hollow dreams No tweeve through nights used
[35.46 - 37.46]  Blues in the alley
[37.46 - 41.34]  That ghost fade nocturnal notes we've made
[41.34 - 43.90]  Underneath the city's side
[43.90 - 49.10]  On its strings softly cried
[49.10 - 53.58]  Footsteps pass unseen faces silent
[53.58 - 59.06]  Empty empty secret places
[59.06 - 68.66]  A melody of broken sorrows Loneliness in the tomorrow's
[68.66 - 70.62]  Can you hear it?
[70.62 - 75.50]  In the song of night Heartbeats lost our sight
[75.50 - 80.62]  In this alley time stand still
[80.62 - 84.62]  Notes of grief a bitter pill
[84.62 - 87.82]  Stars watch over tales untold
[87.82 - 92.86]  Moments shared then ground cold Strings whisper beneath the dark
[92.86 - 96.86]  Tracing scars upon the heart
[96.86 - 106.86]  Blues in the alley
[106.86 - 110.86]  That ghost fade nocturnal notes we've made
[110.86 - 113.34]  Underneath the city's side
[113.34 - 116.86]  On its strings softly cried
[116.86 - 119.34]  Blues in the alley
[119.34 - 122.94]  That ghost fade nocturnal notes we've made
[123.18 - 125.82]  Underneath the city's side
[125.82 - 128.62]  On its strings softly cried
[128.62 - 130.62]  We cry
[130.62 - 135.82]  Footsteps pass past unseen faces silent
[135.82 - 138.78]  Nocturnal notes we've made
[138.78 - 141.34]  Underneath the city's side
[141.34 - 145.74]  On its strings softly cried
[145.74 - 151.02]  Footsteps pass us unseen faces silent
[151.02 - 156.70]  Empty empty secret places
[156.70 - 163.18]  A melody of broken sorrows Loneliness in the tomorrow's
[163.18 - 164.94]  Can you hear it?
[164.94 - 171.02]  In the song of night Heartbeats lost our sight
[171.02 - 174.86]  In this alley time stand still
[175.02 - 176.86]  Notes of grief a bitter pill
[176.86 - 186.86]  A bitter pill
[188.86 - 190.86]  Can you hear it?
[190.86 - 196.86]  The song of night Heartbeats lost our sight
[196.86 - 200.62]  In this alley time stand still
[200.62 - 204.62]  Notes of grief a bitter pill
[219.42 - 221.02]  Can you hear it?
[221.02 - 226.46]  The song of night Heartbeats lost our sight
[226.46 - 229.34]  In this alley time stand still
[229.34 - 233.34]  Notes of grief a bitter pill
