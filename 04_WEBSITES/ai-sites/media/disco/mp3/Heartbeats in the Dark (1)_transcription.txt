[0.00 - 25.68]  The stars above like old friends, lighting the park, feel my heart beats in the dark,
[26.32 - 38.08]  heart beats in the dark, through the shadows we tread on pathways unknown,
[39.20 - 47.28]  oh worry not, for you're not alone, a beacon of hope in the silence we embark,
[47.36 - 55.60]  feel my heart beats in the dark, heart beats in the dark, when the night seems long and the road
[55.60 - 64.40]  so far, just listen for the rhythm of my beating heart, together we'll journey through
[64.40 - 70.96]  lies pitch and bar, feel my heart beats in the dark, heart beats in the dark,
[77.36 - 85.20]  in the quiet moments when words start to fade and the fears come creeping, don't be afraid,
[85.20 - 94.88]  for every step you take I'll never far, feel my heart beats in the dark, heart beats in the dark,
[94.88 - 104.40]  when the night seems long and the road so far, just listen for the rhythm of my beating heart,
[104.40 - 111.68]  together we'll journey through lies pitch and bar, feel my heart beats in the dark,
[111.68 - 121.44]  heart beats in the dark, when the night seems long and the road so far, just listen for the rhythm
[121.44 - 130.88]  of my beating heart, together we'll journey through lies pitch and bar, feel my heart beats in the dark,
[130.88 - 133.28]  heart beats in the dark,
[133.28 - 143.76]  when the morning comes and the shadows receive you see the journey was just what you need,
[143.76 - 152.88]  with every heartbeat, a promise to embark, feel my heart beats in the dark, heart beats in the dark,
[152.88 - 162.00]  when the night seems long and the road so far, just listen for the rhythm of my beating heart,
[162.80 - 169.36]  together we'll journey through lies pitch and bar, feel my heart beats in the dark,
[170.32 - 180.40]  heart beats in the dark,
