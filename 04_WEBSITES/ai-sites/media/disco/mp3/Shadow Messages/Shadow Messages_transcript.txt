00:00 -- 00:09:  Hollow eyes in the night, whispers through the scream
00:10 -- 00:15:  Fingers tap in the dark, shadows share the seam
00:17 -- 00:22:  Glitches spark the void, echoes in the wire
00:23 -- 00:28:  Hollow crimes collide, silent voices conspire
00:30 -- 00:39:  Shadow messages, distorted cries
00:44 -- 00:49:  Through the static haze, in the digital skies
00:52 -- 00:57:  Waves of broken light, signal flickers and fades
00:58 -- 01:04:  Messages encrypted in these ghostly cascades
01:05 -- 01:10:  Dreams in pixel form, fragments of the mind
01:10 -- 01:15:  Fragments in the shell, our worlds intertwined
01:19 -- 01:24:  Shadow messages, distorted cries
01:28 -- 01:33:  Through the static haze, in the digital skies
01:33 -- 01:38:  Shadow messages, distorted cries
01:54 -- 01:59:  Waves of broken light, signal flickers and fades
01:59 -- 02:03:  Messages encrypted in these ghostly cascades
02:03 -- 02:07:  Dreams in pixel form, fragments of the mind
02:07 -- 02:12:  Spirits in the shell, our worlds intertwined
02:12 -- 02:17:  Shadow messages, distorted cries
02:18 -- 02:24:  Through the static haze, in the digital skies
02:29 -- 02:36:  Thanks for watching!
