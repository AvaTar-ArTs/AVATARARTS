00:00 -- 00:07:  Moonlit valley's calling, willow trees sway slow
00:07 -- 00:14:  Heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night it grows
00:14 -- 00:20:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:20 -- 00:27:  Echoes of the laughter fill the spaces in between
00:27 -- 00:34:  A long time coming, our minds couldn't change
00:34 -- 00:41:  Can't keep on running, it's the time to break away
00:41 -- 00:48:  Rivers rushing forward, swallowed by the tide
00:48 -- 00:54:  Wildflowers blooming on the other side
