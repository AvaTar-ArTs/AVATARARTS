00:00 -- 00:02:  You
00:30 -- 00:32:  You
01:00 -- 01:02:  You
01:07 -- 01:14:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing now I roam these streets alone
01:15 -- 01:18:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings
01:19 -- 01:22:  Darken nights. I've always known
01:23 -- 01:26:  Love was sweet, but now it's gone
01:27 -- 01:29:  echoes of a
01:29 -- 01:34:  Distant tune left me with this heavy gloom
01:35 -- 01:37:  No more love songs
01:51 -- 01:53:  Broken dreams
01:59 -- 02:01:  I
02:10 -- 02:13:  Tried to win your heart in vain
02:14 -- 02:17:  Sung my soul beneath the moon
02:18 -- 02:21:  But your love was just a chain
02:22 -- 02:25:  Now I howl a different tune
02:26 -- 02:29:  No more kisses in the rain
02:30 -- 02:33:  songs now lace with the pain
02:34 -- 02:36:  freedom bounces
02:36 -- 02:38:  broken chains
02:38 -- 02:40:  No more love songs
02:55 -- 02:58:  I
03:25 -- 03:40:  I
03:40 -- 03:48:  No more love songs in the night
03:48 -- 03:56:  Only echoes of our fights
03:56 -- 04:04:  Broken dreams they scatter white
04:04 -- 04:12:  In this alley where I hide
04:18 -- 04:24:  No more love songs in the night
