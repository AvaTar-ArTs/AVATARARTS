[0.00 - 11.00]  In the valley shadows call Heartbreak echoes nightfall
[11.00 - 23.00]  A hailing cat sings sad tunes The late nights under the moon
[23.00 - 28.00]  Willow trees whisper so low Broken hearts and sorrow flow
[28.00 - 34.00]  The funny tune in the air Floating soft and despair
[34.00 - 40.00]  Hailing cat sings tonight That goes through the moonlight
[40.00 - 51.00]  Gentle cry soft and frail In this light-lost hill
[51.00 - 57.00]  Stars above in sorrow's gaze Lonely nights and winds haze
[57.00 - 63.00]  Under trees songs are made Melodies of joy and pain
[66.00 - 73.00]  We're all trees whisper so low Broken hearts and sorrow flow
[73.00 - 80.00]  Flow flow flow Of all you in the low
[80.00 - 85.00]  Willow and cats song tonight That goes through the moonlight
[85.00 - 100.00]  Gentle cry soft and frail In this valley-lost hill
[101.00 - 108.00]  Stars above in sorrow's gaze Lonely nights and winds haze
[108.00 - 114.00]  Under trees songs are made Melodies of joy and pain
[114.00 - 119.00]  We're all trees whisper so true In the moonlight old yet new
[119.00 - 125.00]  A soft and frail past Holding on hope will last
[126.00 - 131.00]  Hailing cat song tonight That goes through the moonlight
[131.00 - 136.00]  Gentle cry soft and frail In this valley-lost hill
[155.00 - 158.00]  You
