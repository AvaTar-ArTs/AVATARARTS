00:00 -- 00:16:  Shadows on the wall from flickering light, whispering tales of our last fight.
00:16 -- 00:24:  You left your ghost in every room, loneliness in bloom.
00:24 -- 00:32:  Promises like brittle leaves, falling down from broken trees.
00:32 -- 00:41:  The scent of you still lingers here, drowning in my tears.
00:41 -- 00:48:  Love's gone cold, just empty space, caught between heartaches and breaks.
00:48 -- 00:57:  But from ashes I will rise, find my own skies.
00:57 -- 01:05:  Piece by piece I mend my soul, gather strength to fill my hole.
01:05 -- 01:13:  The world outside is calling loud, to stand up from this shroud.
01:13 -- 01:21:  Reflections in a shattered glass, show me that this too shall pass.
01:21 -- 01:29:  A new dawn breaking on the sea, finally set free.
01:44 -- 01:53:  Love's gone cold, just empty space, caught between heartaches and breaks.
01:53 -- 02:00:  But from ashes I will rise, find my own skies.
02:13 -- 02:42:  Piece by piece I mend my soul, gather strength to fill my hole.
02:43 -- 02:51:  The world outside is calling loud, to stand up from this shroud.
02:51 -- 02:59:  Reflections in a shattered glass, show me that this too shall pass.
02:59 -- 03:08:  A new dawn breaking on the sea, finally set free.
03:08 -- 03:15:  Love's gone cold, just empty space, caught between heartaches and breaks.
03:15 -- 03:22:  But from ashes I will rise, find my own skies.
