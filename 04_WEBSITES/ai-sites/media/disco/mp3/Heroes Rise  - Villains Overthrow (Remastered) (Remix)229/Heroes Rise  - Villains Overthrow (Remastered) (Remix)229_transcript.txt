00:00 -- 00:12:  Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh
00:12 -- 00:18:  Dark alley, shadow shifting Echo of gold chains clinking
00:18 -- 00:24:  City press tension, heroes and villains Bring the collision
00:24 -- 00:30:  Masked faces in the twilight glow Good and evil in the undertow
00:30 -- 00:36:  Neon signs, some secrets deep Dreams awake while nightmares creep
00:37 -- 00:43:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts of old
00:43 -- 00:49:  Lines of blood, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
00:49 -- 00:55:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts of old
00:55 -- 01:01:  Lines of blood, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
01:12 -- 01:18:  Whispers carried by the cold night air Footsteps heavy but no one's there
01:18 -- 01:24:  Courage rises in the fading light Truth emerges from the endless fight
01:24 -- 01:30:  Steel and concrete on their tomb Under the shadow of the pale moon
01:30 -- 01:36:  The pulse of life in chaos sings Of broken crowns and hidden kings
01:38 -- 01:44:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts of old
01:44 -- 01:50:  Lines of blood, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
01:50 -- 01:56:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts of old
01:56 -- 02:02:  Lines of blood, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
02:14 -- 02:25:  Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh
