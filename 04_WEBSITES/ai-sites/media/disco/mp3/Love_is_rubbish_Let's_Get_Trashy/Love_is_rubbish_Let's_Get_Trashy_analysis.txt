The lyrics in this section paint a vivid picture of a gritty and unconventional love story set in a dark and unconventional urban landscape. The imagery of alley cats, broken dreams, and shattered glass sets a tone of desolation and decay, suggesting a world where beauty can be found in unexpected places.

The narrator and their partner navigate this harsh environment with a sense of defiance and romance, scavenging treasures and creating a kingdom out of scraps. The mention of living fast, eating trash, and being surrounded by rusty hearts emphasizes a raw and unpolished love, one that thrives in the midst of neglect and abandonment.

The repeated refrain "Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight" captures the essence of their relationship - unconventional, perhaps looked down upon by society, but deeply meaningful and authentic to them. The imagery of kings and queens of litter, with dumpsters for thrones and cans filled with delight, suggests a sense of empowerment and royalty in their unconventional world.

The mention of "her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles" and drinking cheap wine from a paper bag adds a touch of romance and beauty to the otherwise harsh surroundings. The reference to old stardust and street lamp waddles hints at a sense of nostalgia and magic woven into their everyday existence.

The section ends with a powerful affirmation of their love, finding it burning bright amidst the polluted light. The instrumental breaks in between the verses allow the listener to soak in the atmosphere and emotions conveyed through the lyrics.

Overall, the lyrics in this section convey themes of unconventional love, resilience, finding beauty in decay, and embracing one's own unique identity, even if it means being considered 'trashy' by societal standards. The narrative arc follows the journey of the narrator and their partner as they navigate their unconventional love story in a world that may not understand or appreciate their bond.
