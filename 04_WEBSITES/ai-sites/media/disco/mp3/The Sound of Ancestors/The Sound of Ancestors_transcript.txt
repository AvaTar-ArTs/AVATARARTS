00:00 -- 00:05:  This is in an item, drums that call the line
00:05 -- 00:10:  Shadows move in time, and sisters alive
00:10 -- 00:16:  Dancing on the breeze, laughter through the trees
00:16 -- 00:21:  Echoes of the past, moments meant to last
00:21 -- 00:26:  Hear the heartbeat pound, feet upon the ground
00:26 -- 00:32:  Rhythms of our name, worship in the flame
00:42 -- 00:48:  Stars that brightly gleam, flowing like a stream
00:48 -- 00:53:  Voices soft and clear, drawing spirits near
00:53 -- 00:58:  Hands to sky we raise, chanting ancient praise
00:58 -- 01:03:  Feel the energy, soul in harmony
01:14 -- 01:20:  Underneath the moon, voices hum in tune
01:20 -- 01:25:  Guidance from above, wrapped in sacred love
01:50 -- 02:12:  Stars that brightly gleam, flowing like a stream
02:12 -- 02:18:  Voices soft and clear, drawing spirits near
02:18 -- 02:23:  Hands to sky we raise, chanting ancient praise
02:23 -- 02:29:  Feel the energy, soul in harmony
02:29 -- 02:34:  Hear the heartbeat pound, feet upon the ground
02:34 -- 02:40:  Rhythms of our name, worship in the flame
02:40 -- 02:45:  Stars that brightly gleam, flowing like a stream
02:45 -- 02:50:  Voices soft and clear, drawing spirits near
