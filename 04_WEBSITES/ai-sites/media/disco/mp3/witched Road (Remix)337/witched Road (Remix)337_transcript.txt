00:00 -- 00:29:  Marching ever forward
00:29 -- 00:33:  Underneath the wooded shrine
00:33 -- 00:36:  I stray not from the path
00:36 -- 00:41:  I hold death's hand in mine
00:41 -- 00:45:  Primal night, give it sight
00:45 -- 00:48:  Familiar by thy side
00:48 -- 00:51:  If sun be gone, we carry on
00:51 -- 00:54:  Spirit as our guide
00:54 -- 00:59:  Down, down, down the road
00:59 -- 01:02:  Down the witch's road
01:02 -- 01:07:  Down, down, down the road
01:07 -- 01:10:  Down the witch's road
01:10 -- 01:14:  Down, down, down the road
01:14 -- 01:17:  Down the witch's road
01:17 -- 01:21:  Blood and tears and bones
01:21 -- 01:27:  Maiden mother crone
01:27 -- 01:31:  The road is wild and wicked
01:31 -- 01:34:  Winding through the wood
01:34 -- 01:37:  Where all that's wrong is right
01:37 -- 01:40:  And all that's bad is good
01:40 -- 01:44:  Through many miles of twisted trials
01:44 -- 01:46:  We wander high and low
01:46 -- 01:49:  Take your fears
01:49 -- 01:52:  A door appears
01:52 -- 01:56:  The time has come to go
01:56 -- 02:01:  Down, down, down the road
02:01 -- 02:04:  Down the witch's road
02:04 -- 02:09:  Down, down, down the road
02:09 -- 02:12:  Down the witch's road
02:12 -- 02:16:  Down, down, down the road
02:16 -- 02:20:  Down the witch's road
02:20 -- 02:23:  Follow me my friend
02:23 -- 02:26:  To glory and the end
02:46 -- 03:01:  Down, down, down the road
03:01 -- 03:04:  Down the witch's road
03:04 -- 03:09:  Down, down, down the road
03:09 -- 03:12:  Down the witch's road
03:13 -- 03:16:  Down, down, down the road
03:16 -- 03:20:  Down the witch's road
03:20 -- 03:23:  Follow me my friend
03:23 -- 03:26:  To glory and the end
