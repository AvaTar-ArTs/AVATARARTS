00:00 -- 00:07:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine
00:07 -- 00:15:  I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:15 -- 00:21:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight
00:21 -- 00:29:  If sun be gone, we carry on, spirit as our guide
00:29 -- 00:48:  Gently into the black, hushed and silent sea
00:48 -- 00:56:  Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:00 -- 01:13:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand, hold on fast
01:13 -- 01:25:  Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
01:25 -- 01:33:  On we march, if I fall, lead me
01:33 -- 01:44:  Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
01:44 -- 01:56:  And the hollow echoes with the past lives of our souls
01:57 -- 02:10:  We will walk this earth forever, until the earth reclaims our bones
02:10 -- 02:19:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
02:19 -- 02:31:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
