00:00 -- 00:12:  In the junkyard where I played With this grass and broken dreams
00:12 -- 00:19:  Found a world where music stayed In the quiet middle seas
00:19 -- 00:25:  Old cans would be my drums Broken strings would be my tune
00:25 -- 00:33:  For every beat my heart drums In the light of the junkyard moon
00:33 -- 00:45:  Play my junkyard symphony Hear the magic in the night
00:45 -- 00:58:  Raise our hands in unity Feel the hope and see the light
00:58 -- 01:05:  When the shadows start to creep And the world begins to fade
01:05 -- 01:18:  From the silence deep, deep, deep Music always finds its way
01:18 -- 01:24:  With a song we fight the dark Raise our voice in harmony
01:24 -- 01:37:  Every note will make its mark In our junkyard symphony
01:37 -- 01:50:  Play my junkyard symphony Hear the magic in the night
01:50 -- 02:02:  Raise our hands in unity Feel the hope and see the light
02:02 -- 02:09:  With a song we fight the dark Raise our voice in harmony
02:09 -- 02:22:  Every note will make its mark In our junkyard symphony
02:22 -- 02:34:  Play my junkyard symphony Hear the magic in the night
02:34 -- 02:47:  Raise our hands in unity Feel the hope and see the light
