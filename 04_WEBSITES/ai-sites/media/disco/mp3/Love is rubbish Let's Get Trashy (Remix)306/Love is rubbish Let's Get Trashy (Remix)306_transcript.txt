00:00 -- 00:09:  In the shadows where the out-of-cats plow, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town.
00:09 -- 00:15:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown.
00:15 -- 00:24:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:31 -- 00:40:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:40 -- 00:46:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:46 -- 00:55:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap.
00:56 -- 01:04:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:04 -- 01:11:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:12 -- 01:19:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:20 -- 01:29:  We're dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight.
01:29 -- 01:35:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:41 -- 01:46:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles.
01:46 -- 01:50:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:50 -- 01:55:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
01:57 -- 02:04:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
02:07 -- 02:10:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune.
02:11 -- 02:16:  Alley symphony, our romance is feral.
02:16 -- 02:20:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:22 -- 02:27:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree.
02:27 -- 02:32:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:32 -- 02:39:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:41 -- 02:47:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
02:50 -- 02:57:  We're dumpsters for a throne, and cans filled with delight.
02:57 -- 03:04:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
