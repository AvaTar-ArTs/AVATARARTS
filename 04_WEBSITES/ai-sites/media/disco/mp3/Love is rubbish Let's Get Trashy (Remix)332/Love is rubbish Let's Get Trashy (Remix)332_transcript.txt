00:00 -- 00:10:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town.
00:10 -- 00:16:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown.
00:16 -- 00:25:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:25 -- 00:26:  Woo!
00:43 -- 00:51:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:51 -- 00:58:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:58 -- 01:07:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap.
01:07 -- 01:14:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:14 -- 01:23:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:23 -- 01:32:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:32 -- 01:40:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight,
01:40 -- 01:46:  we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:53 -- 01:58:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles.
01:58 -- 02:02:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
02:02 -- 02:09:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
02:09 -- 02:19:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle,
02:19 -- 02:24:  stray dogs bark a mournful tune.
02:24 -- 02:35:  Alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:35 -- 02:40:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree.
02:40 -- 02:48:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:48 -- 02:56:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:56 -- 03:02:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
03:05 -- 03:12:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight,
03:12 -- 03:18:  we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
