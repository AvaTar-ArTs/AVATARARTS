00:00 -- 00:10:  In the shadows of the outer clouds prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town
00:10 -- 00:16:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown
00:16 -- 00:25:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:30 -- 00:51:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:51 -- 00:58:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:58 -- 01:07:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap
01:07 -- 01:14:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map
01:14 -- 01:23:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:23 -- 01:32:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:32 -- 01:40:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:40 -- 01:46:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:53 -- 01:57:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:57 -- 02:01:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
02:01 -- 02:08:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles
02:08 -- 02:19:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
02:19 -- 02:26:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony
02:26 -- 02:34:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free
02:34 -- 02:39:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree
02:39 -- 02:47:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:47 -- 02:55:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:55 -- 03:04:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
03:04 -- 03:12:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
03:12 -- 03:18:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
