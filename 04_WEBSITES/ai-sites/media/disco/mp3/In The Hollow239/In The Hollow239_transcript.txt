00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:20 -- 00:26:  Primal night, give it sight Familiar by thy side
00:26 -- 00:33:  If sun be gone we carry on Spirit as our guide
00:50 -- 01:10:  Gently into the black, hushed and silent sea Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:11 -- 01:27:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand Hold on fast, moon above be our guide
01:28 -- 01:33:  Bring us safely to our side
01:34 -- 01:49:  Take my hand, on we march if I fall Leave me there, moon above be our guide
01:50 -- 01:55:  Bring us safely to our side
01:56 -- 02:09:  And the hollow echoes with the past lives of our souls We will walk this earth forever until the earth reclaims our bones
02:09 -- 02:28:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
02:29 -- 02:34:  Death does indeed come for us all
02:39 -- 02:49:  Thanks for watching!
