00:00 -- 00:12:  Marching ever forward, knee through wooded shrine
00:12 -- 00:20:  I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:20 -- 00:27:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight
00:27 -- 00:34:  If sun be gone, we carry on, spirit and flow die
00:34 -- 00:42:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
00:42 -- 00:50:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
00:50 -- 00:56:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's row
00:56 -- 01:03:  At the ends of earth we rise
01:03 -- 01:11:  Crossover through the realms we fly
01:11 -- 01:18:  Lost soul in my arms, show me your scars
01:18 -- 01:27:  In this we're alive, no wrong or right
01:27 -- 01:34:  In this we're alive
01:34 -- 01:43:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
01:43 -- 01:51:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
01:51 -- 01:57:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's row
01:57 -- 02:03:  Spirit lead the way through darkened skies
02:03 -- 02:10:  Don't look back and don't ask why
02:10 -- 02:16:  The only thing I need tonight
02:16 -- 02:20:  Is you and I
02:20 -- 02:28:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
02:28 -- 02:37:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's glow
02:37 -- 02:43:  Down, down, down low, down the witching's row
02:43 -- 02:49:  Bring the sea free to our side
02:50 -- 02:52:  Thanks for watching!
