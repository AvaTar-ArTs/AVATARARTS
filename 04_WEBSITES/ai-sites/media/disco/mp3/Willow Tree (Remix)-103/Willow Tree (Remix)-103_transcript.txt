00:00 -- 00:07:  Moonlit valleys callin', willow trees sway slow
00:07 -- 00:14:  Heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night, it grows
00:14 -- 00:21:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:21 -- 00:28:  Echoes of the laughter fade into the dreams we keep
00:28 -- 00:35:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancin' with the trees
00:35 -- 00:45:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
00:45 -- 00:52:  From the sorrow rises, hope that never dies
00:52 -- 00:58:  Whispering willows listen to the heartfelt cries
