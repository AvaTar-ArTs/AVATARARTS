00:00 -- 00:06:  Moonlit valleys calling, willow trees sway slow
00:06 -- 00:13:  Heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night, it grows
00:13 -- 00:20:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:20 -- 00:26:  Echoes of the laughter fade into the dreams we keep
00:26 -- 00:33:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
00:33 -- 00:41:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
00:41 -- 01:00:  In the night so silent, loneliness does creep
01:00 -- 01:07:  Yet the moon she guides me through the pain in which I weep
01:08 -- 01:20:  Ooh, ooh
01:20 -- 01:27:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
01:27 -- 01:34:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back
01:34 -- 01:40:  From the sorrow rises, hope that never dies
01:40 -- 01:50:  Whispering willows listen to the heartfelt cries
01:57 -- 02:07:  Thanks for watching!
