00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward neath the wooded shrine, I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine.
00:20 -- 00:33:  Primal knight, give it sight, familiar by thy side, if sun be gone we carry on, spirit as our guide.
00:33 -- 00:55:  Down, down, down the road, down the witch's road.
00:56 -- 01:15:  Blood and tears and bones, maiden mother crone, the road is wild and wicked, winding through the wood, where all that's wrong is right and all that's bad is good.
01:16 -- 01:29:  Through many miles of twisted trials, we wander high and low, take your fears, a door appears, the time's come to go.
01:30 -- 01:52:  Down, down, down the road, down the witch's road.
01:53 -- 01:59:  Follow me, my friend, to glory and the end.
01:59 -- 02:22:  Down, down, down the road, down the witch's road.
02:23 -- 02:37:  Down, down, down the road, down the witch's road.
02:38 -- 02:45:  Follow me, my friend, to glory and the end.
02:52 -- 02:54:  Thanks for watching!
