[0.00 - 11.00]  Music
[11.00 - 14.92]  Moonlit Valley's calling
[14.92 - 20.72]  Relo tree's way slow
[20.72 - 27.00]  Heartbreak like a whisper
[27.00 - 33.00]  In the still of night it rose
[33.00 - 38.00]  Once was joy in morning
[38.00 - 44.00]  Now the shadows cast so deep
[44.00 - 50.00]  It goes up the laughter
[50.00 - 56.00]  Fading to the dreams we keep
[56.00 - 62.00]  Heartbreak open the trees
[62.00 - 67.00]  Dancing with the trees
[67.00 - 73.00]  Moonlit nights and willow whispers
[73.00 - 79.00]  Take me back please
[79.00 - 84.00]  In the night so silent
[84.00 - 90.00]  Loneliness does creep
[90.00 - 95.00]  Yet the moon she guides me
[95.00 - 101.00]  Through the pain in which I weave
[101.00 - 107.00]  Heartbreak open the trees
[107.00 - 112.00]  Dancing with the trees
[112.00 - 118.00]  Moonlit nights and willow whispers
[118.00 - 124.00]  Take me back please
[124.00 - 129.00]  From the sorrow rises
[129.00 - 135.00]  Hope that never dies
[135.00 - 140.00]  With spring with those listen
[140.00 - 147.00]  To the heartfelt cry
[165.00 - 179.00]  Moonlit nights and willow whispers
[179.00 - 186.00]  Take me back please
[186.00 - 193.00]  From the sorrow rises
[193.00 - 200.00]  Hope that never dies
[200.00 - 207.00]  With spring with those listen
[207.00 - 214.00]  To the heartfelt cry
[214.00 - 220.00]  Moonlit nights and willow whispers
[220.00 - 227.00]  Take me back please
