00:00 -- 00:12:  Start this mess in the morning light Coffee stains on a shirt too tight
00:12 -- 00:19:  Who cares about the latest trend I ain't no money to spend
00:19 -- 00:24:  Rain pours down on rusted cars Beauty found in all these scars
00:24 -- 00:29:  Turn up the noise, feel the sting Imperfection's the king
00:31 -- 00:37:  No more love songs, no more lies Only truth under these skies
00:37 -- 00:42:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
00:45 -- 00:51:  Gravel paths and broken bones Laughter carved in sticks and stones
00:51 -- 00:55:  Find the gold in the grind Embrace and take your time
00:58 -- 01:04:  Faces crooked, stories old Hearts not polished but so bold
01:04 -- 01:08:  Whisper tales of battles won In the light of setting sun
01:10 -- 01:16:  Embrace the flaws, hold them tight Through the struggle comes the light
01:16 -- 01:22:  Sing no more those perfect rhymes Life's in dust and grime
01:35 -- 01:41:  No more love songs, no more lies Only truth under these skies
01:41 -- 01:46:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
01:48 -- 01:54:  Gravel paths and broken bones Only truth under these skies
01:54 -- 02:01:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
02:01 -- 02:08:  Gravel paths and broken bones Laughter carved in sticks and stones
02:08 -- 02:12:  Find the gold in the grind Embrace and take your time
02:15 -- 02:21:  Faces crooked, stories old Hearts not polished but so bold
02:21 -- 02:26:  Whisper tales of battles won In the light of setting sun
02:31 -- 02:37:  Embrace the flaws, hold them tight Through the struggle comes the light
02:37 -- 02:43:  Sing no more those perfect rhymes Life's in the dust and grime
02:55 -- 03:01:  Embrace the flaws, hold them tight Through the struggle comes the light
03:01 -- 03:07:  Sing no more those perfect rhymes Life's in the dust and grime
03:07 -- 03:13:  In the dust and grime
03:13 -- 03:27:  In the dust and grime
03:37 -- 03:39:  In the dust and grime
