00:00 -- 00:07:  🎵 Music 🎵
00:07 -- 00:14:  🎵 Moonlit valleys calling, willow trees sway slow 🎵
00:14 -- 00:23:  🎵 Heartbreak like a whisper, in the still of night it grows 🎵
00:23 -- 00:30:  🎵 Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep 🎵
00:30 -- 00:39:  🎵 Echoes of the laughter, fade into the dreams we keep 🎵
00:39 -- 00:52:  🎵 Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees 🎵
00:52 -- 01:03:  🎵 Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please 🎵
01:03 -- 01:17:  🎵 Music 🎵
01:17 -- 01:24:  🎵 In the night so silent, loneliness does creep 🎵
01:24 -- 01:33:  🎵 Yet the moon she guides me, through the pain in which I weep 🎵
01:33 -- 01:47:  🎵 Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees 🎵
01:47 -- 01:58:  🎵 Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please 🎵
01:58 -- 02:04:  🎵 Music 🎵
02:04 -- 02:11:  🎵 From the sorrow rises, hope that never dies 🎵
02:11 -- 02:18:  🎵 Whispering willows listen, to the heartfelt cries 🎵
02:18 -- 02:39:  🎵 Music 🎵
02:39 -- 02:46:  🎵 From the sorrow rises, hope that never dies 🎵
02:46 -- 02:53:  🎵 Whispering willows listen, to the heartfelt cries 🎵
02:53 -- 03:00:  🎵 Music 🎵
