00:00 -- 00:18:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:18 -- 00:26:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:26 -- 00:33:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:33 -- 00:44:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more lone love songs in the night
00:44 -- 00:58:  Only echoes of our plight Broken dreams they scatter white
00:58 -- 01:02:  In the sally where I hide
01:15 -- 01:22:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:22 -- 01:29:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:29 -- 01:36:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now laced with the pain
01:36 -- 01:48:  Freedom found in broken chains No more lone love songs in the night
01:48 -- 02:01:  Only echoes of our plight Broken dreams they scatter white
02:01 -- 02:06:  In the sally where I hide
02:17 -- 02:30:  No more lone love songs in the night Only echoes of our plight
02:30 -- 02:42:  Broken dreams they scatter white In the sally where I hide
03:00 -- 03:03:  Thanks for watching!
