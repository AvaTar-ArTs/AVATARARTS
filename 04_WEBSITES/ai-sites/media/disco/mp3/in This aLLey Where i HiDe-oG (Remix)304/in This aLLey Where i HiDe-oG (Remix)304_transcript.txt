00:00 -- 00:11:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:11 -- 00:20:  These stars, my heart, it stings Dark nights I've always known
00:20 -- 00:25:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:25 -- 00:29:  Left me with this heavy gloom
00:32 -- 00:38:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
00:38 -- 00:44:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
00:50 -- 01:17:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:17 -- 01:23:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:23 -- 01:29:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now laced with the pain
01:29 -- 01:33:  Freedom found in broken chains
01:33 -- 01:39:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:39 -- 01:45:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:47 -- 02:07:  Instrumental
02:07 -- 02:12:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:12 -- 02:19:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:19 -- 02:24:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:24 -- 02:32:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:32 -- 03:01:  Instrumental
03:02 -- 03:04:  Thanks for watching!
