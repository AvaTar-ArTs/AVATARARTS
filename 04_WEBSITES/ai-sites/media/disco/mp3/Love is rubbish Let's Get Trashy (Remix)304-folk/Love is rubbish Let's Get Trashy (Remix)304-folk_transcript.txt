00:00 -- 00:20:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass east of town
00:20 -- 00:24:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown
00:24 -- 00:34:  Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:34 -- 00:40:  By the fire's orange glow our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:40 -- 00:46:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:46 -- 00:51:  Rusty hearts beating in sink wrapped in plastic wrap
00:51 -- 00:57:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map
01:01 -- 01:07:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:07 -- 01:13:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:13 -- 01:19:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:19 -- 01:25:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:30 -- 01:35:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:35 -- 01:41:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:41 -- 01:46:  Stories of old stardust towed in street lamp waddles
01:46 -- 01:52:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:57 -- 02:02:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony
02:02 -- 02:08:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind
02:08 -- 02:16:  Unchained, free, no fancy words nor clean papers decree
02:16 -- 02:22:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:25 -- 02:32:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:32 -- 02:38:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:38 -- 02:43:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:43 -- 02:50:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
03:02 -- 03:07:  Thanks for watching!
