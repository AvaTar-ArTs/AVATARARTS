00:00 -- 00:05:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing
00:05 -- 00:09:  Now I roam these streets alone
00:09 -- 00:13:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings
00:13 -- 00:17:  Darken nights I've always known
00:17 -- 00:22:  Love was sweet but now it's gone
00:22 -- 00:26:  Echoes of a distant June
00:26 -- 00:30:  Hollycat took my song
00:30 -- 00:34:  Left me with this heavy glue
00:36 -- 00:40:  But our love songs in the night
00:40 -- 00:44:  Are the echoes of our fight
00:44 -- 00:48:  Broken dreams they scatter white
00:48 -- 00:53:  In this alley where I hide
00:57 -- 01:04:  I tried to win your heart in vain
01:04 -- 01:08:  Sun my soul beneath the moon
01:08 -- 01:12:  But your love was just a chain
01:12 -- 01:16:  Now I have a different tune
01:18 -- 01:22:  No more kisses in the rain
01:22 -- 01:26:  No more songs without the pain
01:26 -- 01:30:  Freedom found in broken chains
01:30 -- 01:35:  Wrecking heart beats gone insane
01:35 -- 01:53:  Oh, love songs in the night
01:53 -- 01:57:  Oh, the echoes of our fight
01:57 -- 02:01:  Broken dreams they scatter white
02:01 -- 02:07:  In this alley where I hide
