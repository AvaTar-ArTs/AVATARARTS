00:00 -- 00:21:  Sammie sang in moonlit nights With raccoon band and alley lights
00:21 -- 00:29:  Love fell, it's soft in the dark Till one night love left a mark
00:30 -- 00:36:  Howling cat took Sammie's throne Winning contest all alone
00:36 -- 00:45:  Sammie's heart was torn in two Music now laced with blues
00:45 -- 00:57:  Oh, Sammie, why, oh, why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:57 -- 01:10:  Once you sang of love in the light Now your song's but in the night
01:10 -- 01:29:  Raccoon band plays out of tune Since that fateful night in June
01:29 -- 01:37:  Howling cat's song took the crowd Left poor Sammie crying aloud
01:38 -- 01:45:  Sammie's tunes had lost their glee Heartbreak under the willow tree
01:45 -- 01:53:  Ballads now with teeth and claws Raccoons play with hidden flaw
01:53 -- 02:05:  Oh, Sammie, why, oh, why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
02:05 -- 02:18:  Once you sang of love in the light Now your song's but in the night
02:18 -- 02:26:  Moonlit alley still remembers Songs of love in soft September
02:27 -- 02:40:  Sammie sings with feral spite Turning love into a fight
02:40 -- 02:52:  Oh, Sammie, why, oh, why Did the alley cat steal your sky?
02:52 -- 03:04:  Once you sang of love in the light Now your song's but in the night
