The elder TrashCat, known as Grizzle, raises his staff high, the bone charms clinking softly as they catch the light of the neon and flames. His eyes, clouded with age but sharp with purpose, scan the gathering. The younger TrashCats, their fur matted with the grime of the city, watch him with a mix of reverence and anticipation.

"Tonight," Grizzle croaks, his voice a raspy echo of the fire's roar, "we seek the wisdom of the ancients, the power hidden in the shadows of this world."

The chanting intensifies, a low rumble that vibrates through the alley. The symbols above the fire twist and dance, revealing glimpses of forgotten knowledge, secrets whispered by the wind that sweeps through the urban labyrinth.

As Grizzle completes the pentagram, the ground beneath it pulses with a faint, otherworldly glow. The air hums with energy, and the TrashCats feel a tug at their very souls, urging them toward the witches' road.

The path, lined with flickering green flames, stretches into the darkness beyond the alley. It is a road of trials, a journey that promises transformation but demands sacrifice. The remains of past rituals—withered flowers, charred bones, and melted candles—serve as a testament to those who have walked it before.

Grizzle steps forward, his staff tapping against the pavement with a steady rhythm. "We are the guardians of the forgotten, the keepers of the city's secrets," he declares. "Tonight, we walk the witches' road to reclaim our place in the tapestry of magic."

With a collective breath, the TrashCats fall in line behind him, their eyes fixed on the glowing path. One by one, they step onto the witches' road, the green flames flickering in greeting as they pass.

The alley fades behind them, swallowed by the shadows, as they embark on their journey. The road twists and turns, leading them deeper into the heart of the city's hidden magic, where the trials await and the spirits watch with bated breath.
