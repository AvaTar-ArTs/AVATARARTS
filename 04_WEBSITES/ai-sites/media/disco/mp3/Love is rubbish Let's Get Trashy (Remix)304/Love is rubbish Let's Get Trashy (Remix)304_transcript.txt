00:00 -- 00:16:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass
00:16 -- 00:22:  East of town we scavenge treasure From the tale of the city's frown
00:22 -- 00:31:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:31 -- 00:36:  By the fire's orange glow Kingdom rises from the scrap
00:36 -- 00:42:  She hums the blues of a life Caught in the traps
00:42 -- 00:49:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
00:49 -- 00:54:  We're royalty of refused love In a discarded map
00:54 -- 01:00:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:00 -- 01:06:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:06 -- 01:11:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:11 -- 01:30:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
01:30 -- 01:35:  Her eyes are diamonds Among the broken bottles
01:35 -- 01:41:  We drink cheap wine From a paper bag throttle
01:41 -- 01:46:  Stories of old stardust Olden streetlamp waddles
01:46 -- 01:53:  With every beat from the drum Of an empty milk bottle
01:53 -- 01:57:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune Alley symphony
01:58 -- 02:04:  Our romance is feral Wild as the wind
02:04 -- 02:07:  Unchained, free No fancy words
02:07 -- 02:13:  Nor clean papers decree In the trash we thrive
02:13 -- 02:17:  Hearts wild and debris Love is rubbish
02:17 -- 02:24:  Let's get trashy in the moonlight Kings and queens of litter
02:24 -- 02:30:  In the city's blight With dumpsters for a throne
02:31 -- 02:35:  And cans filled with delight We find love burning bright
02:35 -- 02:47:  By the polluted light
03:00 -- 03:02:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
