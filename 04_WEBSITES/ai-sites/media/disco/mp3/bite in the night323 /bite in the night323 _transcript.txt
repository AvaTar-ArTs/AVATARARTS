00:00 -- 00:19:  Sammy sang the moonlit nights, with raccoon band and alley lights
00:19 -- 00:26:  Love ballads soft in the dark till one night love left a mark
00:31 -- 00:38:  A howling cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone
00:38 -- 00:47:  Sammy's heart was torn in two, music now laced with blues
00:47 -- 00:59:  Oh Sammy, why oh why did the alley cat steal your sky?
00:59 -- 01:11:  Once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night
01:18 -- 01:24:  Raccoon band plays out a tune, since that fateful night in June
01:24 -- 01:31:  An howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy cry out
01:31 -- 01:37:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree
01:37 -- 01:45:  Ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws
01:45 -- 01:57:  Oh Sammy, why oh why did the alley cat steal your sky?
01:57 -- 02:13:  Once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night
02:15 -- 02:34:  Moonlit alleys still remember, songs of love in soft September
02:34 -- 02:43:  Sammy sings with feral spite, turning now into a fight
02:44 -- 02:56:  Oh Sammy, why oh why did the alley cat steal your sky?
02:56 -- 03:12:  Once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night
03:13 -- 03:23:  Thanks for watching!
