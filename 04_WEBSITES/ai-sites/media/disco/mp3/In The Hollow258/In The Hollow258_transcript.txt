00:00 -- 00:26:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:26 -- 00:38:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight If sun be gone, we carry on, spirit as our guide
00:38 -- 01:00:  Down, down, down the road, down the witch's road
01:00 -- 01:18:  Gently into the black, hushed and silent sea Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:18 -- 01:43:  Do not stray from the path, take my hand, hold on fast Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
01:43 -- 02:08:  Take my hand, on we march, if I fall, leave me there Moon above, be our guide, bring us safely to our sight
02:08 -- 02:33:  And the hollow echoes, with the past lives of our souls We will walk this earth forever, until the earth reclaims our bones
02:33 -- 02:55:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
