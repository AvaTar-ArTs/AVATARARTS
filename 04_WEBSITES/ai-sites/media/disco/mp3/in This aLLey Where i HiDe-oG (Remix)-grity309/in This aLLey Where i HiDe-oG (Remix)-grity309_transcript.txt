00:00 -- 00:20:  In the shadows where the darkness prowls, broken dreams and shattered glass
00:20 -- 00:28:  East of town we scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown
00:28 -- 00:40:  Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:40 -- 00:46:  By the fire's orange glow our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:46 -- 00:53:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the trap
00:53 -- 00:59:  Rusty hearts beaten in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap
00:59 -- 01:05:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map
01:05 -- 01:12:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:12 -- 01:18:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:18 -- 01:24:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:24 -- 01:30:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:30 -- 01:48:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:48 -- 01:51:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:51 -- 01:54:  Stories of old starters told in street lamp waddles
01:54 -- 01:58:  With a beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:58 -- 02:03:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune
02:03 -- 02:07:  LA Symphony, our romance is feral
02:07 -- 02:14:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free
02:14 -- 02:19:  No fancy words nor clean papers decree
02:19 -- 02:30:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:30 -- 02:37:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:37 -- 02:43:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:43 -- 02:49:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:49 -- 02:55:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
