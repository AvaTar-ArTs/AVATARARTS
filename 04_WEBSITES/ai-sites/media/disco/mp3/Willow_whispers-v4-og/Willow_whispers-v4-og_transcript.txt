00:00 -- 00:22:  Moonlit Valley's calling, willow trees sway slow
00:22 -- 00:33:  Heartbreak like a whisper, in the still of night it grows
00:33 -- 00:44:  Once was joy in mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:45 -- 00:56:  Echoes of the laughter, fade into the dreams we keep
00:56 -- 01:07:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
01:07 -- 01:18:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
01:18 -- 01:29:  In the night so silent, loneliness does creep
01:30 -- 01:41:  Yet the moon she guides me, through the pain in which I weep
01:41 -- 01:52:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
01:53 -- 02:04:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
02:04 -- 02:15:  From the sorrow rises, hope that never dies
02:15 -- 02:27:  Whispering willows listen, to the heartfelt cry
02:45 -- 02:55:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
02:55 -- 03:05:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
03:05 -- 03:15:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
03:15 -- 03:25:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
03:25 -- 03:35:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
03:55 -- 04:05:  Thanks for watching!
