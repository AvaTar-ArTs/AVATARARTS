00:00 -- 00:17:  In a junkyard where dreams lie, found my home under the sky.
00:17 -- 00:27:  Rusty tunes echo the past, music born from things that last.
00:27 -- 00:39:  Fight for dreams, oh can't you see, junkyard symphony.
00:39 -- 00:49:  Strings from wire, drums from cans, harmony in dusty hands.
00:49 -- 00:59:  Developers came to claim, but we played to save our name.
00:59 -- 01:09:  Fight for dreams, oh can't you see, junkyard symphony.
01:09 -- 01:29:  Strings from wire, drums from cans, harmony in dusty hands.
01:30 -- 01:40:  Developers came to claim, but we played to save our name.
01:40 -- 01:50:  Fight for dreams, oh can't you see, junkyard symphony.
01:59 -- 02:11:  Thanks for watching!
