[0.00 - 4.00]  Down the alley where the shadows grin
[4.00 - 7.00]  Me on flicker and the thumps oozed in
[7.00 - 10.00]  Lost souls gather, they laugh and they sin
[10.00 - 14.00]  Gritty life wrapped in the city's thin skin
[14.00 - 18.00]  Skin poking dreams like glass shards in the dirt
[18.00 - 21.00]  Tattered hearts hiding pain in the heart
[21.00 - 24.00]  Street lights buzz and like a sketchy old flirt
[24.00 - 28.00]  In the hollow gritty, world alert but inert
[28.00 - 32.00]  Me on guards and don't stand fire
[32.00 - 35.00]  Singing songs of old desires
[35.00 - 38.00]  Urban nights a lit up pire
[38.00 - 42.00]  In this alley we conspire
[42.00 - 46.00]  Paidmen's wet reflecting broken stars
[46.00 - 49.00]  Passing bottles and revealing scars
[49.00 - 52.00]  Loves a thief behind rusty old bars
[52.00 - 56.00]  Yeah we dance pretend we're in more movies cars
[56.00 - 60.00]  All the caps with the steel in their eyes
[60.00 - 64.00]  Chasing dreams when they polluted skies
[64.00 - 66.00]  Hope's from thin life the smoke that flies
[66.00 - 70.00]  And this hollow gritty we grieve when the skew lies
[70.00 - 74.00]  Me on guards and don't stand fire
[74.00 - 77.00]  Singing songs of old desires
[77.00 - 81.00]  Urban nights a lit up pire
[81.00 - 84.00]  In this alley we conspire
[86.00 - 96.00]  Broken dreams like glass shards in the dirt
[96.00 - 99.00]  Tattered hearts hiding pain in the heart
[99.00 - 102.00]  Street lights buzz and like a sketchy old flirt
[102.00 - 105.00]  In the hollow gritty, world alert but inert
[105.00 - 107.00]  Me on guards and don't stand fire
[107.00 - 109.00]  Singing songs of old desires
[109.00 - 111.00]  Urban nights a lit up pire
[111.00 - 113.00]  In this alley we conspire
[113.00 - 116.00]  Me on guards and don't stand fire
[116.00 - 120.00]  Singing songs of old desires
[120.00 - 123.00]  Urban nights a lit up pire
[123.00 - 126.00]  In this alley we conspire
[133.00 - 136.00]  We conspire
[136.00 - 140.00]  We conspire
[140.00 - 143.00]  We conspire
[149.00 - 153.00]  Pavements wet reflecting broken stars
[153.00 - 157.00]  Passing bottles and revealing scars
[157.00 - 160.00]  Loves a thief behind rusty old bars
[160.00 - 165.00]  Yeah we dance pretend we're in more movies cars
