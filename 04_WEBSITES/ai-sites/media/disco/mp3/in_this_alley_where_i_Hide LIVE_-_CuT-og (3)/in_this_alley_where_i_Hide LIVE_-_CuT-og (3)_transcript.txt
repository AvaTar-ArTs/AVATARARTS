00:00 -- 00:16:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:16 -- 00:25:  Beneath the stars, my heart, it stings Darkened nights, I've always known
00:25 -- 00:33:  Love was sweet, but now it's gone Echoes of distant June
00:33 -- 00:41:  Hollycat took my song Left me with this heavy blue
00:41 -- 00:50:  Wrote old love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
00:50 -- 00:58:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
00:58 -- 01:06:  I tried to win your heart In vain, son
01:06 -- 01:15:  My soul beneath the moon But your love was just a chain
01:15 -- 01:24:  Now I have a different tune No more kisses in the rain
01:24 -- 01:32:  No more without the pain Freedom found in broken chains
01:32 -- 01:38:  Wrecking heartbeats gone insane
01:38 -- 01:47:  Hollycat took my song Left me with this heavy blue
01:47 -- 01:55:  Wrote old love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
01:55 -- 02:03:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:03 -- 02:12:  I tried to win your heart In vain, son
02:12 -- 02:29:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
02:29 -- 02:37:  Hollycat took my song Left me with this heavy blue
02:37 -- 02:45:  Wrote old love songs in the night All the echoes of our fight
02:45 -- 02:54:  Broken dreams, they scatter white In this alley where I hide
02:54 -- 03:02:  I tried to win your heart In vain, son
03:02 -- 03:10:  I tried to win your heart In vain, son
