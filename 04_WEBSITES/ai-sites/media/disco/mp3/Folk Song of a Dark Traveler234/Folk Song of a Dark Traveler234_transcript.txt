00:00 -- 00:17:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's
00:17 -- 00:25:  hand in mine Primal night, give it sight
00:25 -- 00:34:  Familiar by thy side, if sun be gone We carry on, spirit ends or die
00:34 -- 00:42:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's grove
00:42 -- 00:50:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's grove
00:50 -- 00:57:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's grove
00:57 -- 01:12:  At the ends of earth we rise Cross over, through the realms we fly
01:12 -- 01:25:  Lost soul in my arms, show me your scars In this we're alike, no wrong or right
01:25 -- 01:37:  In this we're alive Spirit lead, through whom to die
01:37 -- 01:57:  Don't look back, don't ask why The only thing I need tonight is you and I
01:57 -- 02:10:  Take my hand, oh we might If I fall, leave the light
02:10 -- 02:23:  Hold the day, ear blind Bring the safety to our sight
