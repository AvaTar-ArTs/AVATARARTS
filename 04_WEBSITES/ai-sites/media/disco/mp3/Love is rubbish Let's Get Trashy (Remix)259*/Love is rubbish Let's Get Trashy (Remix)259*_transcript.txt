00:00 -- 00:14:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass
00:14 -- 00:20:  East of town we scavenge treasure From the tale of the city's frown
00:20 -- 00:25:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:30 -- 00:34:  By the fire's orange glow A kingdom rises from the scrap
00:35 -- 00:40:  She hums the blues Of a life caught in the traps
00:40 -- 00:45:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
00:46 -- 00:50:  Royalty of refuse Love in a discarded map
00:50 -- 00:54:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
00:56 -- 01:00:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:01 -- 01:05:  Dumpsters for a throne Cans filled with delight
01:06 -- 01:11:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
01:15 -- 01:37:  Her eyes are diamonds Among the broken bottles
01:37 -- 01:41:  We drink cheap wine From a paper bag throttle
01:42 -- 01:47:  Stories of old stardust Told in street lamp waddles
01:47 -- 01:52:  With every beat from the drum Of an empty milk bottle
01:52 -- 01:56:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune Alley symphony
01:57 -- 02:03:  Our romance is feral Wild as the wind unchained
02:03 -- 02:08:  Free no fancy words Nor clean papers decree
02:08 -- 02:13:  In the trash we thrive Hearts wild and debris
02:17 -- 02:21:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:23 -- 02:27:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
02:28 -- 02:32:  Dumpsters for a throne Cans filled with delight
02:32 -- 02:48:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
