00:00 -- 00:27:  In the shadows where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass
00:27 -- 00:37:  East of town, we scavenge treasure From the tale of the city's frown
00:37 -- 00:48:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile ill-hound
00:48 -- 00:51:  By the fire's orange glow Our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:51 -- 00:55:  She hums the blues Of a life caught in the traps
00:55 -- 00:58:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
00:58 -- 01:03:  We're royalty of refuse Love in a discarded map
01:05 -- 01:08:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:08 -- 01:12:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:12 -- 01:15:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:15 -- 01:31:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
01:31 -- 01:47:  Her eyes are diamonds Among the broken bottles
01:47 -- 01:51:  We drink cheap wine From a paper bag throttle
01:51 -- 01:54:  Stories of old stardust Told in street lamp waddles
01:54 -- 01:58:  With every beat from the drum Of an empty milk bottle
01:58 -- 02:04:  The stray dogs bark A mournful tune, an alley symphony
02:04 -- 02:14:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind Unshamed, free, no fancy words
02:14 -- 02:20:  Nor clean papers decree In the trash we thrive
02:20 -- 02:25:  Hearts wild and debris Love is rubbish
02:25 -- 02:29:  Let's get trashy in the moonlight Kings and queens of litter
02:29 -- 02:32:  In the city's blight With dumpsters for a throne
02:32 -- 02:36:  And cans filled with delight We find love burning bright
02:36 -- 02:42:  By the polluted light
