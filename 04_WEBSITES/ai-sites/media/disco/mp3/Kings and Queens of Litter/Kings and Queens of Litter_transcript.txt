00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered clouds, east of
00:15 -- 00:16:  town.
00:16 -- 00:23:  Discover treasure from the tale of the city's frown, live fast, live trash, beneath the moon's
00:23 -- 00:29:  hostile howl.
00:29 -- 00:36:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap, she hums the blues of a life
00:36 -- 00:38:  caught in the traps.
00:38 -- 00:48:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap, we're royalty of refuge, love in a discarded
00:48 -- 00:49:  map.
00:49 -- 00:59:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moon, like kings and queens of litter in the city's
00:59 -- 01:00:  plight.
01:00 -- 01:06:  With dumpsters full of thrown-in cans filled with delight, we find our burning bright by
01:06 -- 01:09:  the polluted light.
01:09 -- 01:22:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles, we drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:22 -- 01:30:  Stories of old stardust, told in street lamp waddles, with every beat from the drum of
01:30 -- 01:33:  an empty milk bottle.
01:33 -- 01:41:  The straight old park, a mournful tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the
01:41 -- 01:48:  wind, unashamed, free, no fancy words, no clean papers decree.
01:48 -- 01:53:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
01:53 -- 02:02:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moon, like kings and queens of litter in the city's
02:02 -- 02:03:  plight.
02:03 -- 02:10:  With dumpsters full of thrown-in cans filled with delight, we find our burning bright by
02:10 -- 02:12:  the polluted light.
02:19 -- 02:30:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moon, like kings and queens of litter in the city's
02:30 -- 02:31:  plight.
02:31 -- 02:38:  With dumpsters full of thrown-in cans filled with delight, we find our burning bright by
02:38 -- 02:40:  the polluted light.
02:49 -- 02:59:  The rise of diamonds among the broken bottles, we drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
02:59 -- 03:07:  Stories of old stardust, told in street lamp waddles, with every beat from the drum of
03:07 -- 03:09:  an empty milk bottle.
03:10 -- 03:21:  The stray dogs bark, a mournful tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral, wild as the
03:21 -- 03:28:  wind, unashamed, free, no fancy words, no clean papers decree.
03:28 -- 03:35:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
03:36 -- 03:45:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moon, like kings and queens of litter in the city's
03:45 -- 03:46:  plight.
03:46 -- 03:53:  With dumpsters full of thrown-in cans filled with delight, we find our burning bright by
03:53 -- 03:55:  the polluted light.
