00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:21 -- 00:31:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight, if sun be gone we carry on
00:32 -- 00:45:  Spirit lead the way through darkened skies, don't look back and don't ask why
00:45 -- 00:57:  The only thing I need tonight is you and I
01:01 -- 01:24:  At the ends of earth we rise, cross over through the realms we fly
01:25 -- 01:41:  Lost soul in my arms, show me your scars, in this we're alike, no wrong or right
01:41 -- 01:54:  Spirit lead the way through darkened skies, don't look back and don't ask why
01:54 -- 02:06:  The only thing I need tonight is you and I
02:11 -- 02:21:  The only thing I need tonight is you and I
