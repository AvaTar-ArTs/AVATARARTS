00:00 -- 00:12:  In the shadows, where the early cats prowl Broken dreams in shattered glass, east of town
00:12 -- 00:16:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown
00:16 -- 00:22:  Live fast, live trash beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:22 -- 00:30:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap
00:30 -- 00:34:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps
00:34 -- 00:40:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap
00:40 -- 00:47:  A royalty of refuse, love in a discarded wrap
00:47 -- 00:53:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
00:53 -- 00:59:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
00:59 -- 01:06:  With monsters for throne and cans filled with delight
01:06 -- 01:11:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:11 -- 01:15:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:15 -- 01:19:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
01:19 -- 01:23:  Stories of old startups told in street lamp waddles
01:23 -- 01:29:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle
01:29 -- 01:34:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony
01:34 -- 01:41:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained
01:41 -- 01:45:  Free, no fancy words, no clean papers decree
01:45 -- 01:52:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and in debris
01:52 -- 01:59:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:59 -- 02:04:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:04 -- 02:11:  With monsters for throne and cans filled with delight
02:11 -- 02:16:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:16 -- 02:27:  Instrumental
02:27 -- 02:35:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:35 -- 02:42:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:43 -- 02:50:  With monsters for throne and cans filled with delight
02:50 -- 02:56:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:56 -- 03:02:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
03:02 -- 03:08:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
03:08 -- 03:15:  With monsters for throne and cans filled with delight
03:15 -- 03:21:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
03:21 -- 03:41:  Instrumental
