00:00 -- 00:07:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now we're on these streets alone
00:08 -- 00:15:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:16 -- 00:22:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:23 -- 00:29:  Howling cat took my soul Left me with this heavy gloom
00:30 -- 00:37:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
00:38 -- 00:46:  Broken dreams they skyride In this alley where I hide
00:53 -- 01:02:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:03 -- 01:10:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:11 -- 01:17:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
01:18 -- 01:24:  Freedom found in broken chains Record heartbeats gone insane
01:25 -- 01:32:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:33 -- 01:41:  Broken dreams they skyride In this alley where I hide
01:42 -- 01:49:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:50 -- 01:59:  Broken dreams they skyride In this alley where I hide
02:03 -- 02:05:  Where I hide
02:11 -- 02:18:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:19 -- 02:27:  Broken dreams they skyride In this alley where I hide
