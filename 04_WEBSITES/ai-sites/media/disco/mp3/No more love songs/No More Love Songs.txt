In the morning, I start this mess in the morning, like coffee stains on a shirt to tie. Who cares about the latest trend? I ain't no money to spend. Rain pours down on rusted cars, beauty found in all these scars.
Turn up the noise. Feel the stink. Imperfection's the king. No more love songs, no more lies. Only truth under these skies. Chaos dancing in the breeze. Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
Gravel paths and broken bones. Laughter carved in sticks and stones. Find the gold in the ground. Embrace and take your time. Faces crooked, stories old. Hearts not polished, but so bold. Whisper tales of battles won, in the light of setting sun.
Embrace the flaws, pull them tight. Through the struggle comes the light. Sing no more those perfect rhymes, lost in the dust and grime. No more love songs, no more lies. Only truth under these skies. Chaos dancing in the breeze. Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
Gravel paths and broken bones. Loving truth under these skies. Chaos dancing in the breeze. Life's a mess, ain't it a tease? Chaos dancing in the breeze. Life's a mess, ain't it a tease? Gravel paths and broken bones.
Laughter carved in sticks and stones. Find the gold in the ground. Embrace and take your time. Faces crooked, stories old. Hearts not polished, but so bold. Whisper tales of battles won, in the light of setting sun.
