00:30 -- 00:50:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams like shattered glass
00:50 -- 00:55:  East of town we scavenge Treasure from the tale of the city's frown
00:55 -- 00:58:  Live fast, eat trash Beneath the moon's hostile howl
00:58 -- 01:03:  By the fire's orange glow Our kingdom rises from the scrap
01:03 -- 01:09:  She hums the blues Of a life caught in the traps
01:09 -- 01:14:  Rusty hearts beating in sync Wrapped in plastic wrap
01:14 -- 01:19:  We're royalty of refuse Love in a discarded map
01:19 -- 01:25:  Love is rubbish Let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:25 -- 01:31:  Kings and queens of litter In the city's blight
01:31 -- 01:36:  With dumpsters for a throne And cans filled with delight
01:36 -- 01:41:  We find love burning bright By the polluted light
01:55 -- 02:10:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle
02:10 -- 02:13:  Stories of old stardust Tolling streetlamp waddles
02:13 -- 02:16:  With every beat from the drum Of an empty milk bottle
02:16 -- 02:22:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune Alley symphony, our romance is feral
02:22 -- 02:31:  Wild as the wind, unchained Free, no fancy words
02:31 -- 02:36:  Nor clean papers decree In the trash we thrive
02:36 -- 02:39:  Hearts wild and debris Love is rubbish
02:39 -- 02:46:  Let's get trashy in the moonlight Kings and queens of litter
02:47 -- 02:52:  In the city's blight With dumpsters for a throne
02:52 -- 02:57:  And cans filled with delight We find love burning bright
02:57 -- 03:01:  By the polluted light
