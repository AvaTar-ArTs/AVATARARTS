00:00 -- 00:23:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights, with raccoon band and alley lights, love ballad soft in the dark, till one night love left a mark.
00:23 -- 00:40:  Howlin' cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone, Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues.
00:40 -- 00:57:  Oh Sammy, why oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky, once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night.
00:57 -- 01:16:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howlin' cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
01:16 -- 01:32:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree, ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws.
01:32 -- 01:50:  Moonlit alleys still remember, songs of love in soft September, Sammy sings with feral spite, turning love into a fight.
02:02 -- 02:26:  Oh Sammy, why oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky, once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night.
02:26 -- 02:43:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howlin' cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
02:43 -- 03:00:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howlin' cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
03:00 -- 03:19:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howlin' cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
03:19 -- 03:35:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree, ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws.
03:35 -- 03:51:  Moonlit alleys still remember, songs of love in soft September, Sammy sings with feral spite, turning love into a fight.
