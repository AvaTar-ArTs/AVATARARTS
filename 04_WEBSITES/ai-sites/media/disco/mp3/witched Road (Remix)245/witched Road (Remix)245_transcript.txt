00:00 -- 00:27:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine A stray knot from the path, I hold death's
00:27 -- 00:37:  hand in mine, primal night, give it sight Familiar by thy side, if sun be gone, we
00:37 -- 00:46:  carry on, spirit as our guide
00:46 -- 01:09:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
01:09 -- 01:23:  Blood and tears and bones, maiden mother crone The road is wild and wicked, winding through
01:23 -- 01:29:  the wood Where all that's wrong is right, and all that's
01:29 -- 01:35:  bad is good Through many miles of twisted trials, we
01:35 -- 01:42:  wander high and low Take your fears, a door appears, the time
01:42 -- 01:43:  has come to go
01:43 -- 02:11:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
02:11 -- 02:16:  Follow me, my friend, to glory and the end
02:41 -- 03:07:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
