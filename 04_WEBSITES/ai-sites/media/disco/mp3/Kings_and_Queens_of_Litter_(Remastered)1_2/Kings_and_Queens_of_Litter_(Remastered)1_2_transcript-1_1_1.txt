00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass east of
00:15 -- 00:19:  town We scavenge treasure from the tale of the
00:19 -- 00:23:  city's frown Live fast, live trash beneath the moon's
00:23 -- 00:33:  hostile howl By the fire's orange glow our kingdom rises
00:33 -- 00:36:  from the scraps She hums the blues of a life caught in the
00:36 -- 00:43:  traps Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic
00:43 -- 00:48:  wrap We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded
00:48 -- 00:49:  map
00:49 -- 00:55:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
00:55 -- 01:00:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
01:00 -- 01:04:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
01:04 -- 01:09:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
01:09 -- 01:17:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:17 -- 01:26:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle Stories of old stardust told in streetlamp
01:26 -- 01:30:  waddles With every beat from the drum of an empty
01:30 -- 01:36:  milk bottle The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley
01:36 -- 01:44:  symphony Our romance is feral, wild as the wind unchained
01:44 -- 01:48:  We're free, no fancy words nor clean papers decree
01:48 -- 01:53:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
01:53 -- 01:59:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
01:59 -- 02:03:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:03 -- 02:08:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:08 -- 02:13:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:14 -- 02:27:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:27 -- 02:31:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:31 -- 02:36:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:36 -- 02:41:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:44 -- 02:55:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
02:55 -- 03:04:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle Stories of old stardust told in streetlamp
03:04 -- 03:08:  waddles With every beat from the drum of an empty
03:09 -- 03:17:  milk bottle The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley
03:17 -- 03:24:  symphony Our romance is feral, wild as the wind unchained
03:24 -- 03:29:  We're free, no fancy words nor clean papers decree
03:29 -- 03:37:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
03:37 -- 03:42:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
03:42 -- 03:46:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
03:46 -- 03:51:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
03:51 -- 03:56:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
