00:00 -- 00:18:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:19 -- 00:30:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:32 -- 00:43:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:44 -- 00:49:  Left me with this heavy gloom
00:56 -- 01:07:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:07 -- 01:20:  Broken dreams they scatter wild In this alley where I hide
01:20 -- 01:36:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:37 -- 01:48:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:49 -- 02:01:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs now laced with the pain
02:02 -- 02:14:  Freedom found in broken chains Like a love beast or insane
02:15 -- 02:26:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:26 -- 02:39:  Broken dreams they scatter wild In this alley where I hide
