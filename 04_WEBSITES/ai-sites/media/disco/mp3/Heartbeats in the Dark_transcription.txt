[0.00 - 16.00]  Soap whispers on the wind Through the hills we walk
[16.00 - 22.00]  Your hand and mine Find and strengthen the talk
[22.00 - 26.00]  The stars above like old friends Lattin' at park
[26.00 - 30.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[30.00 - 34.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[36.00 - 42.00]  Through the shadows we tread On pathways unknown
[42.00 - 46.00]  The worry not, for you're not alone
[46.00 - 52.00]  A beacon of hope In the silence we embark
[52.00 - 56.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[56.00 - 60.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[68.00 - 72.00]  When the night seems hot and road so far
[72.00 - 78.00]  Just listen for the rhythm Of my beating heart
[78.00 - 84.00]  Together we'll journey Through life's pitch and bar
[84.00 - 88.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[88.00 - 90.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[94.00 - 98.00]  In the quiet moments When words start to fade
[98.00 - 104.00]  If the fear's come Creeping don't be afraid
[104.00 - 108.00]  For every step you take I'm never far
[108.00 - 112.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[112.00 - 116.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[118.00 - 122.00]  Close your eyes and lead into the sound
[122.00 - 128.00]  A symphony of love In the night and fall
[128.00 - 132.00]  Unseem but unfaultery Like a never-spark
[132.00 - 136.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[136.00 - 140.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[144.00 - 148.00]  When the morning comes And the shadows receive
[148.00 - 150.00]  You see the journey was just what you need
[150.00 - 154.00]  With every heartbeat A promise to mark
[154.00 - 158.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[158.00 - 160.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[162.00 - 186.00]  When the night seems long And road so far
[186.00 - 192.00]  Just listen for the rhythm Of my beating heart
[192.00 - 196.00]  Together we'll journey Through life's pitch and bar
[196.00 - 200.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[200.00 - 204.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[206.00 - 210.00]  Heart beats in the dark
[216.00 - 226.00]  Close your eyes and lead into the sound
[226.00 - 230.00]  A symphony of love In the night profound
[230.00 - 234.00]  Unseem but unfaultery Like an ever-spark
[234.00 - 238.00]  Feel my heart beats in the dark
[238.00 - 240.00]  Heart beats in the dark
