00:00 -- 00:08:  Whispers in the wind, a memory that stays
00:08 -- 00:17:  Softly calling out my name, in distant nights and days
00:17 -- 00:21:  Shadows on the wall, dancing in the light
00:21 -- 00:30:  Echoes of our laughter, fading into the night
00:30 -- 00:34:  Echoes of love, calling from above
00:34 -- 00:43:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
00:43 -- 00:47:  Footprints in the sand, waves wash them away
00:47 -- 00:55:  But the heart remembers still, every word we used to say
00:55 -- 01:04:  In the silence I hear, all the love that wasn't near
01:04 -- 01:09:  Like a song forever sung, by hearts forever young
01:09 -- 01:13:  Echoes of love, calling from above
01:13 -- 01:18:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
01:18 -- 01:22:  Echoes of love, calling from above
01:22 -- 01:35:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
01:35 -- 01:39:  Footprints in the sand, waves wash them away
01:39 -- 01:50:  But the heart remembers still, every word we used to say
01:50 -- 01:56:  Footprints of love, calling from above
01:56 -- 02:10:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
02:10 -- 02:14:  Echoes of love, calling from above
02:14 -- 02:18:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
02:18 -- 02:23:  Echoes of love, calling from above
02:23 -- 02:27:  Carrying our dreams, in the night it seems
02:53 -- 02:54:  Are we contents?
02:54 -- 02:56:  In the silence I give up where?
02:56 -- 02:57:  What if you weren't we used to say?
02:58 -- 03:01:  In the silence I hear, all the love that was near
03:01 -- 03:04:  Like a song forever sung, by hearts forever young
03:04 -- 03:05:  By hearts forever young
03:08 -- 03:08:  Done?
