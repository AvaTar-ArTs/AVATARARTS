00:00 -- 00:15:  Dark city streets, shadows fallin' Empty hearts all cryin' out
00:15 -- 00:22:  Echoes of dreams all forgotten Lost souls searchin' for a route
00:22 -- 00:30:  Faces weary, eyes show sorrow Wanderin' through the fire alone
00:30 -- 00:37:  Nighttime fades, bringin' tomorrow Hope like dawn, forever shown
00:37 -- 00:44:  Rise together, we can fly now Storms behind us, sky is clear
00:44 -- 00:52:  Hand in hand, we'll change our world now Feel the love, drive out the fear
00:52 -- 01:00:  Unity in hearts unbroken Voices risin' from the pain
01:00 -- 01:07:  Chains of darkness now are broken Sunlight's bright after the rain
01:07 -- 01:14:  Through the struggle we found meaning Through the tears our spirit's strong
01:14 -- 01:22:  Now we stand a new beginning We won't falter, we'll be alone
01:22 -- 01:30:  Rise together, we can fly now Storms behind us, sky is clear
01:30 -- 01:37:  Hand in hand, we'll change our world now Feel the love, drive out the fear
01:52 -- 02:00:  Rise together, we can fly now Storms behind us, sky is clear
02:00 -- 02:07:  Hand in hand, we'll change our world now Feel the love, drive out the fear
02:07 -- 02:15:  Rise together, we can fly now Storms behind us, sky is clear
02:15 -- 02:21:  Hand in hand, we'll change our world now Feel the love, drive out the fear
