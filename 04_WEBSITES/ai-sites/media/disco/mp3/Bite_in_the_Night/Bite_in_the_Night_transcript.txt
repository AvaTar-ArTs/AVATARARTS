00:00 -- 00:22:  With raccoon band and alley lights, love ballads soft in the dark, til one night love left a mark.
00:22 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone, Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues.
00:39 -- 00:56:  Oh Sammy why, oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky? Once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night.
00:56 -- 01:15:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
01:15 -- 01:32:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
01:33 -- 01:50:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree, ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws.
01:50 -- 02:07:  Moonlit alley still remember, songs of love in soft September, Sammy sings with feral spite, turning love into fire.
02:21 -- 02:43:  Oh, oh, moonlit alley still remember, songs of love in soft September, Sammy sings with feral spite, turning love into fire.
02:43 -- 03:10:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
03:13 -- 03:17:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
03:17 -- 03:19:  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
03:28 -- 03:33:  Moonlit alley still remember, songs
03:33 -- 03:37:  of love in soft September.
03:37 -- 03:42:  Sammi sings with feral spite, turning love
03:42 -- 03:46:  into a fight.
03:46 -- 03:50:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
03:50 -- 03:53:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
