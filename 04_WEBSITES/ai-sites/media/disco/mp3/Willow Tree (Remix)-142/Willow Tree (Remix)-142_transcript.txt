00:00 -- 00:06:  Moonlit valley's calling, willow trees sway slow
00:07 -- 00:13:  Heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night it grows
00:14 -- 00:20:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:21 -- 00:27:  Echoes of the laughter fill the spaces in between
00:28 -- 00:34:  A long time coming, our minds couldn't change
00:35 -- 00:41:  Can't keep on running, it's the time to break away
00:42 -- 00:48:  Rivers rushing forward, swallowed by the tide
00:49 -- 00:55:  Wildflowers blooming on the other side
00:56 -- 01:02:  I will find my solace in the places left behind
01:03 -- 01:09:  Echoes of the laughter and the moments out of time
01:10 -- 01:16:  A long time coming, our minds couldn't change
01:17 -- 01:23:  Can't keep on running, it's the time to break away
01:25 -- 01:30:  Thanks for watching!
