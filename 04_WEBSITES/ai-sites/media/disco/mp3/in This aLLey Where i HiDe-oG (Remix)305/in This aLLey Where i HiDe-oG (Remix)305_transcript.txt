00:00 -- 00:25:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:25 -- 00:37:  Beneath the stars my heart, it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:37 -- 00:50:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:50 -- 01:00:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
01:00 -- 01:13:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
01:13 -- 01:27:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
01:27 -- 01:39:  Tried to end your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:39 -- 01:50:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:50 -- 02:02:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
02:02 -- 02:15:  Freedom found in broken chains Rackled heartbeats gone insane
02:15 -- 02:27:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:27 -- 02:39:  Broken dreams they scatter white In this alley where I hide
