[0.00 - 6.60]  citrine
[6.60 - 9.34]  underneath the velvet sky
[9.34 - 11.44]  where secrets softly lie
[11.44 - 15.26]  a night begins to whisper dreams
[15.26 - 17.68]  my hopes are running high
[17.68 - 21.18]  and shadows cast by moonlight's grace
[21.18 - 23.80]  my thoughts begin to string
[23.80 - 29.80]  I wonder if I'll find my place and dreams are flowed away
[31.80 - 36.80]  Silver beams through twilight streams painting the nights and breaks
[36.80 - 42.80]  Reflections of my heart's desires in every hidden space
[42.80 - 48.80]  Stars align in silence pure their twinkle breaths attune
[48.80 - 54.80]  Each note a tale of what could be amidst the midnight swoon
[55.80 - 60.80]  Moonlight reverie, dance with me tonight
[61.80 - 66.80]  End up quiet hours, dreams will take their flight
[66.80 - 72.80]  With every fleeting shimmer my soul feels so alive
[73.80 - 79.80]  In the moonlight reverie our passions softly die
[84.80 - 89.80]  Echoes from the streets below a symphony so slight
[89.80 - 95.80]  They drift into the arms of night where everything feels right
[95.80 - 101.80]  The city's home allullaby as gentle breezes sigh
[102.80 - 107.80]  Together we embark on dreams beneath the starlit sky
[108.80 - 114.80]  Siling whispers through the trees a serenade so sweet
[115.80 - 120.80]  The answers to my heart's own quest my just beyond my reach
[120.80 - 126.80]  In this gentle peaceful hour my spirit finds its quest
[127.80 - 133.80]  Longing for the moons and breaks I lay my mind to rest
[133.80 - 139.80]  Moonlight reverie, dance with me tonight
[139.80 - 144.80]  End up quiet hours, dreams will take their flight
[145.80 - 150.80]  With every fleeting shimmer my soul feels so alive
[150.80 - 157.80]  In the moonlight reverie our passions softly die
[181.80 - 187.80]  Echoes from the streets below a symphony so slight
[187.80 - 193.80]  They drift into the arms of night where everything feels right
[193.80 - 199.80]  The city's home allullaby as gentle breezes sigh
[199.80 - 206.80]  In the moonlight reverie our passions softly die
