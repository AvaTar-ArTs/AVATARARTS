00:00 -- 00:20:  In the shadows where the darkness prowls Broken dreams and shattered glass
00:20 -- 00:25:  East of town We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's
00:25 -- 00:29:  frown Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's
00:29 -- 00:38:  hostile howl By the fire's orange glow
00:38 -- 00:46:  Our kingdom rises from the scrap She hums a blues of a life caught in the

02:27 -- 02:33:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:33 -- 02:41:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight With dumpsters for a throne
02:41 -- 02:49:  And cans filled with delight We find love burning bright by the polluted light
