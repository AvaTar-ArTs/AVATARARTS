00:00 -- 00:12:  Dark alleys, shadows shifting Echo of gold chains clinking
00:12 -- 00:24:  City breaths, tension, heroes and villains Break the collision
00:24 -- 00:30:  Masked faces in the twilight glow Good and evil in the undertow
00:30 -- 00:36:  Neon signs, some secrets deep Dreams awake while nightmares creep
00:36 -- 00:42:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts so bold
00:42 -- 00:50:  Lines are blurred, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
00:50 -- 01:01:  Oh, oh In the city's eternal fight
01:03 -- 01:09:  Whispers carried by the cold night air Footsteps heavy but no one's there
01:09 -- 01:15:  Courage rises in the fading light Truth emerges from the endless fight
01:15 -- 01:21:  Steel and concrete hum their tune Under the shadow of the pale moon
01:21 -- 01:27:  The pulse of life in chaos sings Of broken crowns and hidden kings
01:27 -- 01:33:  On the edge where stories fold Battles fought in hearts so bold
01:33 -- 01:40:  Lines are blurred, no wrong, no right In the city's eternal fight
01:41 -- 01:52:  Oh, oh In the city's eternal fight
01:59 -- 02:04:  In the city's eternal fight
02:10 -- 02:16:  In the city's eternal fight
