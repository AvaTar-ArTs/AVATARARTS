00:00 -- 00:13:  Born among the scrap, in the rust and the dust
00:13 -- 00:22:  He found his melody in the things left lost
00:22 -- 00:31:  Strings of wire tied, cans and old wood blocks
00:31 -- 00:39:  He played his heart out with the rhythm of the clocks
00:39 -- 00:48:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
00:48 -- 00:58:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
00:58 -- 01:07:  People gathered around to hear his junkyard song
01:07 -- 01:16:  A spark of wonder found in the beat so strong
01:16 -- 01:24:  When shadows tried to take the home he loved and knew
01:24 -- 01:33:  He strummed louder for their sake, inspiring hearts anew
01:33 -- 01:42:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
01:42 -- 01:52:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
02:02 -- 02:09:  When shadows tried to take the home he loved and knew
02:09 -- 02:18:  He strummed louder for their sake, inspiring hearts anew
02:18 -- 02:27:  Echoes of the junkyard, sounds of hope and dreams
02:27 -- 02:37:  Munch made the music from forgotten things
02:39 -- 02:49:  Thanks for watching!
