00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine
00:20 -- 00:33:  Primal night, give it sight, familiar by thy sight As sun be gone, we carry on, spirit as our guide
00:33 -- 00:55:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
00:56 -- 01:09:  Blood and tears and bones, maiden mother crone The road is wild and wicked, winding through the wood
01:10 -- 01:16:  Where all that's wrong is right, and all that's bad is good
01:17 -- 01:23:  Through many miles of twisted trials, we wander high and low
01:24 -- 01:29:  Take your fears, a door appears, the time has come to go
01:30 -- 01:52:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
01:53 -- 02:00:  Follow me, my friend, to glory and the end
02:00 -- 02:23:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
02:23 -- 02:38:  Down, down, down the road, down the witcher's road
02:39 -- 02:46:  Follow me, my friend, to glory and the end
02:53 -- 02:58:  Thanks for watching!
