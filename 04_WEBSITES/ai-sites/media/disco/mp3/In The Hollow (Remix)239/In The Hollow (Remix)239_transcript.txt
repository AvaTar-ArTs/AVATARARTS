00:00 -- 00:20:  Marching ever forward, neath the wooded shrine I strain off from the path I hold death's hand in mine
00:20 -- 00:26:  Primal night, give it sight Familiar by thy side
00:26 -- 00:33:  If sun be gone, we carry on Spirit as our guide
00:33 -- 00:49:  Down, down, down the mountain, down the vultures' moan
00:50 -- 01:05:  Fade into the black, hushed and silent sea Silent as the voice who cries to be free
01:05 -- 01:18:  Do not stray from the path Take my hand, hold on fast
01:18 -- 01:31:  Moon above, be our guide Bring us safely to our sight
01:31 -- 01:44:  Take my hand, on we march If I fall, leave me there
01:44 -- 01:58:  Moon above, be our guide Bring us safely to our sight
02:01 -- 02:11:  And the hollow echoes with the past lives of our souls
02:11 -- 02:18:  We will walk this earth forever until the earth reclaims our bones
02:18 -- 02:32:  The song of the hollow will follow us all the way home
