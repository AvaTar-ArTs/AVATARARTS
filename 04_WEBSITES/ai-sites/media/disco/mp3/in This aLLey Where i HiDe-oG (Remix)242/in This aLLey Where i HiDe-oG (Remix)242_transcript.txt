00:00 -- 00:19:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:19 -- 00:29:  Beneath the stars my heart, it stings Darker nights I've always known
00:29 -- 00:39:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:39 -- 00:49:  Howling cat took my song Left me with this heavy gloom
00:49 -- 00:59:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
00:59 -- 01:08:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
01:16 -- 01:26:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:26 -- 01:39:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:39 -- 01:49:  No more kisses in the rain No more songs without the pain
01:49 -- 01:59:  Freedom found in broken chains Raccoon heartbeats gone insane
01:59 -- 02:09:  No more love songs in the night Only echoes of our fight
02:09 -- 02:19:  Broken dreams they scatter wide In this alley where I hide
