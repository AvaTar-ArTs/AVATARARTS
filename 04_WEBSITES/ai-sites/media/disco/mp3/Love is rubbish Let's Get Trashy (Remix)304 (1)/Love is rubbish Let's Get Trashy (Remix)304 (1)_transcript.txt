00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows is where I prowl Broken dreams and shattered glass east of
00:15 -- 00:20:  town We scavenge treasure from the tale of the
00:20 -- 00:25:  city's frown Live fast, eat trash beneath the moon's
00:25 -- 00:34:  hostile howl By the fire's orange glow
00:34 -- 00:40:  Our kingdom rises from the scrap She hums the blues of a life caught in the
00:40 -- 00:44:  traps Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in
00:44 -- 00:51:  plastic wrap We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded
00:51 -- 01:01:  map Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the
01:01 -- 01:06:  moonlight Kings and queens of litter in the city's
01:06 -- 01:11:  blight With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled
01:11 -- 01:16:  with delight We find love burning bright by the polluted
01:16 -- 01:26:  light Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles
01:26 -- 01:36:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle Stories of old stardust told in street lamp
01:36 -- 01:41:  waddles With every beat from the drum of an empty
01:41 -- 01:54:  milk bottle Stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony
01:54 -- 02:04:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind Unchained, free, no fancy words nor clean
02:04 -- 02:16:  papers decree In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris
02:16 -- 02:22:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:22 -- 02:27:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight
02:27 -- 02:32:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight
02:32 -- 02:36:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light
02:57 -- 02:58:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight
02:58 -- 02:58:
