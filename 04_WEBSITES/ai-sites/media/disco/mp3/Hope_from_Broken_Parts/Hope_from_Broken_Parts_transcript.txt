00:00 -- 00:10:  In the junkyard where I grew, found some treasure no one knew.
00:10 -- 00:18:  Broken strings and rusted keys, became the sound of drinks for free.
00:18 -- 00:26:  Old cans and metal thunks, turned to beets from scraps and junk.
00:26 -- 00:33:  Hands on strings we'd strum and play, turn trash to gold each day.
00:33 -- 00:41:  We made music from the rust, instruments built from the dust.
00:41 -- 00:49:  Sound of hopeful broken parts, junkyard symphony in hearts.
00:49 -- 01:00:  We made music from the rust, instruments built from the dust.
01:00 -- 01:08:  Sound of hopeful broken parts, junkyard symphony in hearts.
01:08 -- 01:15:  Neighbors gathered round to see, magic from our symphony.
01:15 -- 01:23:  Crushing doubts with every note, making art from what they broke.
01:23 -- 01:31:  Raise awareness, spread the word, make the world more than you heard.
01:31 -- 01:40:  From the scraps of hopeless days, build a tomb that rightly lays.
01:40 -- 01:48:  We made music from the rust, instruments built from the dust.
01:48 -- 01:56:  Sound of hopeful broken parts, junkyard symphony in hearts.
02:11 -- 02:18:  Raise awareness, spread the word, make the world more than you heard.
02:18 -- 02:26:  From the scraps of hopeless days, build a tomb that rightly lays.
02:26 -- 02:34:  We made music from the rust, instruments built from the dust.
02:34 -- 02:42:  Sound of hopeful broken parts, junkyard symphony in hearts.
