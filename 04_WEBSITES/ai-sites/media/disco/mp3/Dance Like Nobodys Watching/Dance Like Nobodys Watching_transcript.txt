00:00 -- 00:14:  Feel the beat, it's all around Lose your worries, hit the ground
00:14 -- 00:20:  Freedom's callin' in the sound Let your heart just pound, pound, pound
00:20 -- 00:29:  In the lights, we're shinin' bright Movin' fast into the night
00:29 -- 00:36:  Every step feels so right We're alive, just hold on tight
00:36 -- 00:43:  Dance like nobody's watchin' Let your spirit take flight
00:43 -- 00:51:  Forget the world, keep rockin' Party on through the night
00:51 -- 00:58:  In this moment, it's so clear Every doubt will disappear
00:58 -- 01:05:  Feel the joy, no room for fear Gonna make it crystal clear
01:13 -- 01:21:  Let the chains let your soul fly Underneath the open sky
01:21 -- 01:28:  Don't hold back, no room for fear We were born to rise up high
01:28 -- 01:35:  Dance like nobody's watchin' Let your spirit take flight
01:35 -- 01:43:  Forget the world, keep rockin' Party on through the night
01:43 -- 01:50:  In this moment, it's so clear Every doubt will disappear
01:50 -- 01:58:  Feel the joy, no room for fear Gonna make it crystal clear
