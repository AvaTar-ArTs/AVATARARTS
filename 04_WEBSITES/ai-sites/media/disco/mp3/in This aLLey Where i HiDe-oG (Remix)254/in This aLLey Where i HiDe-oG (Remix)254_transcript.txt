00:00 -- 00:24:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:24 -- 00:38:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darkened nights I've always known
00:38 -- 00:50:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:50 -- 01:02:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
01:02 -- 01:08:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
01:08 -- 01:12:  In this alley where I hide
01:20 -- 01:36:  I tried to win your heart in vain Sung my soul beneath the moon
01:36 -- 01:48:  But your love was just a chain Now I howl a different tune
01:48 -- 02:02:  No more kisses in the rain Songs now laced with the pain
02:02 -- 02:16:  Freedom found in broken chains No more love songs in the night
02:16 -- 02:22:  Only echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
02:22 -- 02:26:  In this alley where I hide
02:46 -- 02:50:  Ooh, ooh, ooh
