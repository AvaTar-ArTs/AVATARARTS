00:00 -- 00:12:  Start this mess in the morning light Coffee stains on a shirt too tight
00:12 -- 00:19:  Who cares about the latest trend I ain't no money to spend
00:19 -- 00:24:  Rain pours down on rusted cars Beauty found in all these scars
00:24 -- 00:29:  Turn up the noise, feel the sting Imperfection's the king
00:31 -- 00:37:  No more love songs, no more lies Only truth under these skies
00:37 -- 00:42:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
00:45 -- 00:51:  Gravel paths and broken bones Life to carve in sticks and stones
00:51 -- 00:55:  Find the gold in the ground Embrace and take your time
00:58 -- 01:04:  Face is crooked, story is old Heart's not polished but so old
01:04 -- 01:08:  Whisper tales of battles won In the light of setting sun
01:10 -- 01:16:  Embrace the flaws, pull them tight Through the struggle comes the light
01:16 -- 01:22:  Sing no more those perfect rhymes Lost in the dust and grime
01:35 -- 01:41:  No more love songs, no more lies Only truth under these skies
01:41 -- 01:46:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
01:48 -- 01:54:  Gravel paths and broken bones Lovely truth under these skies
01:54 -- 01:59:  Chaos dancing in the breeze Life's a mess, ain't it a tease?
02:01 -- 02:08:  Gravel paths and broken bones Life to carve in sticks and stones
02:08 -- 02:12:  Find the gold in the ground Embrace and take your time
02:15 -- 02:21:  Face is crooked, story is old Heart's not polished but so bold
02:21 -- 02:32:  Whisper tales of battles won In the light of setting sun
