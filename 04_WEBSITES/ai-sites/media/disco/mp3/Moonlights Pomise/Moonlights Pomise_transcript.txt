00:00 -- 00:05:  Under the neon flicker, moonlight scatters
00:05 -- 00:10:  Raccoon stream, broken glass, shattered
00:10 -- 00:15:  Diving in dumpsters, love's a dirty game
00:15 -- 00:18:  Heartbreak alley, ain't nothing tame
00:20 -- 00:25:  Whiskey rains falling, love left behind
00:26 -- 00:30:  Dumpster fires where broken hearts bind
00:31 -- 00:35:  Junkyard kings with their empty cans
00:35 -- 00:39:  Whispers of love buried in the sands
00:40 -- 00:44:  Blue fest, here's our trash
00:45 -- 00:50:  Moonlight's promise, gone in a flash
00:50 -- 00:54:  Party hours, thought the fire's cyclo
00:54 -- 00:58:  In the rubble, where wild dreams go
01:03 -- 01:07:  Rusty echoes of the midnight band
01:08 -- 01:12:  Scavenged treasures in our outstretched hand
01:13 -- 01:17:  Cigarette smoke mingles with the stars
01:17 -- 01:21:  In a world of clutter, nothing's gone too far
01:22 -- 01:28:  East side tales wrapped in old newspaper
01:28 -- 01:32:  Love's graffiti scribbled by a caper
01:33 -- 01:37:  Broken hearts singing lullabies
01:37 -- 01:41:  In the dumpsters, we're lost lullabies
01:42 -- 01:47:  Blue fest, here's our trash
01:48 -- 01:52:  Moonlight's promise, gone in a flash
01:53 -- 01:57:  Party hours, thought the fire's cyclo
01:58 -- 02:02:  In the rubble, where wild dreams go
02:08 -- 02:12:  In the rubble, where wild dreams go
02:12 -- 02:18:  Rusty echoes of the midnight band
02:19 -- 02:23:  Scavenged treasures in our outstretched hand
02:24 -- 02:28:  Cigarette smoke mingles with the stars
02:28 -- 02:32:  In a world of clutter, nothing's gone too far
