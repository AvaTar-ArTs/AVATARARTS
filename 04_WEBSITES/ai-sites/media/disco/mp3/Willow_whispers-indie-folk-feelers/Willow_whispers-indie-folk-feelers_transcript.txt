00:00 -- 00:14:  Moonlit valleys calling, willow trees sway slow
00:14 -- 00:24:  Heartbreak like a whisper, in the still of night it grows
00:24 -- 00:34:  Once was joy in mourning, now the shadows cast so deep
00:34 -- 00:45:  Echoes of the laughter, fade into the dreams we keep
00:45 -- 00:55:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
00:55 -- 01:04:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
01:04 -- 01:14:  In the night so silent, loneliness does creep
01:14 -- 01:22:  Yet the moon she guides me, through the pain in which I weep
01:22 -- 01:44:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees
01:45 -- 01:54:  Moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please
01:54 -- 02:04:  From the sorrow rising, hope that never dies
02:04 -- 02:14:  Whispering willows listen, to the heartfelt cries
02:34 -- 02:44:  From the sorrow rising, hope that never dies
02:44 -- 02:54:  Whispering willows listen, to the heartfelt cries
