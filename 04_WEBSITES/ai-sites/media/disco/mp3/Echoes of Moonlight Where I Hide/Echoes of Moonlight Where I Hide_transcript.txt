00:00 -- 00:12:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing, now I roam these streets alone.
00:12 -- 00:21:  Beneath the stars, my heart, it stings. Darker nights I've always known.
00:21 -- 00:30:  Love was sweet, but now it's gone. Echoes of a distant tune.
00:30 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took my song, left me with this heavy gloom.
00:39 -- 00:48:  No more love songs in the night.
00:48 -- 01:03:  Only echoes of our fight. Broken dreams they scatter wide.
01:03 -- 01:10:  In this alley where I hide.
01:10 -- 01:19:  I tried to win your heart in vain. Sung my soul beneath the moon.
01:19 -- 01:27:  But your love was just a chain, now I howl a different tune.
01:27 -- 01:35:  No more kisses in the rain. No more songs without the pain.
01:35 -- 01:46:  Freedom found in broken chains. Raccoon heartbeats gone insane.
01:46 -- 01:55:  No more love songs in the night.
01:55 -- 02:10:  Only echoes of our fight. Broken dreams they scatter wide.
02:10 -- 02:15:  In this alley where I hide.
02:25 -- 02:37:  No more love songs in the night.
02:37 -- 02:45:  Only echoes of our fight.
02:45 -- 02:57:  Broken dreams they scatter wide. In this alley where I hide.
03:15 -- 03:20:  Thanks for watching!
