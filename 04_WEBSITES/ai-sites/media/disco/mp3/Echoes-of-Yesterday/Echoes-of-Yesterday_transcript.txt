00:00 -- 00:11:  Shadows on the wall from flickering light
00:11 -- 00:15:  Whispering tales of our last fight
00:15 -- 00:19:  You left your ghost in every room
00:19 -- 00:22:  Loneliness in bloom
00:22 -- 00:27:  Promises like brittle leaves
00:28 -- 00:32:  Falling down from broken trees
00:32 -- 00:35:  The scent of you still lingers here
00:35 -- 00:38:  Drowning in my tears
00:41 -- 00:45:  Love's gone cold, just empty space
00:45 -- 00:48:  Caught between heartaches and breaks
00:48 -- 00:52:  But from ashes I will rise
00:52 -- 00:55:  Find my own skies
00:57 -- 01:00:  Piece by piece I'll mend my soul
01:00 -- 01:04:  Gather strength to fill my hole
01:05 -- 01:08:  The world outside is calling loud
01:08 -- 01:11:  Stand up from this shroud
01:13 -- 01:17:  Reflections in a shattered glass
01:17 -- 01:21:  Show me that this too shall pass
01:21 -- 01:25:  A new dawn breaking on the sea
01:25 -- 01:28:  Finally set free
01:46 -- 01:50:  Love's gone cold, just empty space
01:50 -- 01:54:  Caught between heartaches and breaks
01:54 -- 01:58:  But from ashes I will rise
01:58 -- 02:01:  Find my own skies
02:24 -- 02:38:  Piece by piece I'll mend my soul
02:38 -- 02:42:  Gather strength to fill my hole
02:42 -- 02:46:  The world outside is calling loud
02:46 -- 02:49:  Stand up from this shroud
02:50 -- 02:54:  Reflections in a shattered glass
02:54 -- 02:58:  Show me that this too shall pass
02:58 -- 03:02:  A new dawn breaking on the sea
03:02 -- 03:05:  Finally set free
03:07 -- 03:11:  Love's gone cold, just empty space
03:11 -- 03:15:  Caught between heartaches and breaks
03:16 -- 03:19:  But from ashes I will rise
03:19 -- 03:22:  Find my own skies
