[0.00 - 12.26]  沉睡
[30.00 - 32.00]  Step, feel so light
[33.00 - 36.00]  Where a life just holds on tight
[37.00 - 39.00]  Dance like nobody's watching
[40.00 - 43.00]  Let your spirit take flight
[44.00 - 46.00]  Forget the world, keep rocking
[48.00 - 51.00]  Party on through the night
[52.00 - 54.00]  In this moment, it's so clear
[55.00 - 58.00]  Every doubt will disappear
[59.00 - 62.00]  Feel the joy in your room for fear
[63.00 - 66.00]  Gonna make it crystal clear
[74.00 - 77.00]  Let the chains let your soul fly
[78.00 - 81.00]  Underneath the open sky
[82.00 - 85.00]  Don't hold back, no room for fear
[86.00 - 88.00]  They were born to rise up high
[89.00 - 91.00]  Dance like nobody's watching
[93.00 - 95.00]  Let your spirit take flight
[97.00 - 99.00]  Forget the world, keep rocking
[101.00 - 103.00]  Party on through the night
[104.00 - 107.00]  In this moment, it's so clear
[108.00 - 110.00]  Every doubt will disappear
[112.00 - 114.00]  Feel the joy in your room for fear
[115.00 - 118.00]  Gonna make it crystal clear
