00:00 -- 00:16:  Shadows on the wall from flickering light Whispering tales of our last fight
00:16 -- 00:24:  You left your ghost in every room Loneliness in bloom
00:24 -- 00:32:  Promises like brittle leaves Falling down from broken trees
00:32 -- 00:40:  The scent of you still lingers here Drowning in my tears
00:40 -- 00:48:  Love's gone cold, just empty space Caught between heartaches and breaks
00:48 -- 00:57:  But from ashes I will rise Find my own skies
00:57 -- 01:05:  Piece by piece I mend my soul Gather strength to fill my hole
01:05 -- 01:13:  The world outside is calling loud Stand up from this shroud
01:13 -- 01:21:  Reflections in a shattered glass Show me that this too shall pass
01:21 -- 01:28:  A new dawn breaking on the sea Finally set free
01:44 -- 01:54:  Love's gone cold, just empty space Caught between heartaches and breaks
01:54 -- 02:01:  But from ashes I will rise Find my own skies
02:13 -- 02:42:  Piece by piece I mend my soul Gather strength to fill my hole
02:43 -- 02:51:  The world outside is calling loud Stand up from this shroud
02:51 -- 02:59:  Reflections in a shattered glass Show me that this too shall pass
02:59 -- 03:08:  A new dawn breaking on the sea Finally set free
03:08 -- 03:16:  Love's gone cold, just empty space Caught between heartaches and breaks
03:16 -- 03:23:  But from ashes I will rise Find my own skies
