00:00 -- 00:20:  Dark alley, shadows shifting, echo of gold chains clinking
00:20 -- 00:26:  City breaths tension, heroes and villains bring the collision
00:26 -- 00:33:  Mass spaces in the twilight, good and evil constant fight
00:33 -- 00:40:  Powerful in the moonlight, heart beating strong
00:40 -- 00:46:  Born to win, breaking through the darkness, can't you see I'm flying high
00:46 -- 00:51:  Every day we rise, let it go, ain't no need to worry
00:51 -- 00:56:  Let the fire ignite
01:11 -- 01:18:  Hero on a journey, brave enough to worry, running into battle with my soul
01:18 -- 01:25:  We'll never stop the mission, don't be afraid to listen, running into battle with my soul
01:25 -- 01:31:  Born to win, breaking through the darkness, can't you see I'm flying high
01:31 -- 01:36:  Every day we rise, let it go, ain't no need to worry
01:36 -- 01:41:  Let the fire ignite
01:48 -- 02:03:  A different kind of war, a different kind of love
02:03 -- 02:11:  I'm just a man and I know that you understand, it takes a different kind of touch
02:18 -- 02:31:  Thanks for watching!
