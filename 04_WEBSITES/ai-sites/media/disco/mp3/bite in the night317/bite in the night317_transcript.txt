00:00 -- 00:24:  Semi-sane moonlit nights with raccoon band and alley lights
00:24 -- 00:33:  Love ballads all in the dark till one night love left a mark
00:33 -- 00:49:  Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
00:49 -- 00:58:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne winning contest all alone
00:58 -- 01:07:  Sammy's heart was torn in two, music now laced with blues
01:07 -- 01:15:  Oh, Sammy, why, oh, why did the alley cat steal your sky?
01:15 -- 01:23:  Once you sang of love and light, now your songs bite in the night
01:23 -- 01:31:  Raccoon band plays out of tune since that fateful night in June
01:31 -- 01:40:  Howling cat's song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud
01:40 -- 01:56:  Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
01:56 -- 02:05:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree
02:05 -- 02:16:  Ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws
02:16 -- 02:24:  Oh Sammy, why, oh why did the alley cat steal your sky?
02:24 -- 02:32:  Once you sang of love and light, now your song's bright in the night
02:32 -- 02:40:  Moonlit alleys still remember songs of love in soft September
02:40 -- 02:49:  Sammy sings with heroes spite, turning love into a fight
02:49 -- 03:07:  Oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
