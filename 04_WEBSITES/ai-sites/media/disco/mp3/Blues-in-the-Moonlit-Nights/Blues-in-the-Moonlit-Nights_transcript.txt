00:00 -- 00:05:  Willows whisperin' in the midnight breeze
00:05 -- 00:09:  Hornet strings playin' melodies with ease
00:09 -- 00:13:  Shadows dance under a silvery glow
00:13 -- 00:19:  Lonesome travelers with no place to go
00:19 -- 00:23:  Nocturnal notes flyin' high and free
00:23 -- 00:28:  Echoes lingering from an old oak tree
00:28 -- 00:32:  Crickets chirpin' their mournful refrain
00:32 -- 00:37:  Moonlight kissin' the windowpane
00:37 -- 00:41:  Blues in the moonlit nights, they sing so low
00:41 -- 00:46:  Heart strings pullin' where the wild winds blow
00:46 -- 00:49:  Serenade from spirits lost and found
00:49 -- 00:55:  In the whispers of the night, our souls are bound
00:55 -- 00:59:  Stars are peepin' through the velvet shroud
00:59 -- 01:04:  Silent witnesses to a lonesome crowd
01:04 -- 01:07:  Dreams are weavin' through the quiet air
01:07 -- 01:12:  In the dance of shadows, midnight fair
01:12 -- 01:26:  Lonely roads twistin' round a bend
01:26 -- 01:30:  Endless stories with no start or end
01:30 -- 01:35:  Fillers playin' by the pale moonlight
01:35 -- 01:39:  Hopeless hearts achin' through the night
01:39 -- 01:43:  Blues in the moonlit nights, they sing so low
01:43 -- 01:48:  Heart strings pullin' where the wild winds blow
01:48 -- 01:51:  Serenade from spirits lost and found
01:51 -- 01:56:  In the whispers of the night, our souls are bound
02:09 -- 02:12:  In the dance of shadows, midnight fair
02:12 -- 02:15:  Lonely roads twistin' round a bend
02:15 -- 02:18:  Endless stories with no start or end
02:18 -- 02:21:  Fillers playin' by the pale moonlight
02:21 -- 02:24:  Hopeless hearts achin' through the night
02:24 -- 02:27:  In the dance of shadows, midnight fair
02:27 -- 02:30:  Lonely roads twistin' round a bend
02:30 -- 02:33:  Endless stories with no start or end
02:33 -- 02:36:  Fillers playin' by the pale moonlight
02:36 -- 02:51:  Thank you for watching!
