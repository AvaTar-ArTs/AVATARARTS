00:00 -- 00:05:  Broken bottles make a sound
00:05 -- 00:09:  Cans and lids we gathered round
00:09 -- 00:14:  Junkyard piles turned to gold
00:14 -- 00:19:  He showed a story to be told
00:19 -- 00:24:  Strings from wires strummed with care
00:24 -- 00:28:  Keys from pipes everywhere
00:28 -- 00:32:  He found rhythm in the waste
00:32 -- 00:37:  Gave each piece a special place
00:37 -- 00:42:  Recycled symphony
00:42 -- 00:47:  Playing for you and me
00:47 -- 00:52:  Turn the trash to timeless truth
00:52 -- 00:59:  Music from the old to new
00:59 -- 01:04:  Hearts and hands came to play
01:04 -- 01:09:  Instruments of every kind
01:09 -- 01:13:  Together we made music strong
01:13 -- 01:18:  Finding beauty in the wrong
01:18 -- 01:23:  With every beat we take a stand
01:23 -- 01:27:  Inspire hope across this land
01:27 -- 01:32:  From the wreckage we arise
01:32 -- 01:37:  With harmony we touch the skies
01:37 -- 01:42:  Recycled symphony
01:42 -- 01:47:  Playing for you and me
01:47 -- 01:52:  Turn the trash to timeless truth
01:52 -- 01:59:  Music from the old to new
02:07 -- 02:12:  With every beat we take a stand
02:12 -- 02:17:  Inspire hope across this land
02:17 -- 02:21:  From the wreckage we arise
02:21 -- 02:27:  With harmony we touch the skies
02:27 -- 02:32:  Recycled symphony
02:32 -- 02:36:  Playing for you and me
02:36 -- 02:41:  Turn the trash to timeless truth
02:41 -- 02:48:  Music from the old to new
