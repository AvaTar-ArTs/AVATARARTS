00:00 -- 00:07:  Rusty chains tangled round a broken swim
00:07 -- 00:13:  A dandelion blooms where the thorns cling
00:13 -- 00:18:  Scratched up records play the same sad song
00:18 -- 00:23:  We danced in shadows where we both belong
00:30 -- 00:41:  Graffiti hearts on the crumbling walls
00:41 -- 00:45:  Faded vows and spray paint scrawls
00:45 -- 00:49:  In the cluttered streets we found our place
00:49 -- 00:56:  Embracing flaws in a lover's grace
00:56 -- 01:07:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrived
01:07 -- 01:12:  In chipped paint and neon lights we come alive
01:12 -- 01:20:  Love and imperfection, a story so old
01:20 -- 01:28:  In our disarray we found gold
01:28 -- 01:32:  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
01:32 -- 01:36:  Lost in the echoes of a broken past
01:36 -- 01:41:  Your wild laugh, my silent cry
01:41 -- 01:45:  In our barbed wire world we touch the sky
01:45 -- 01:49:  Among the wreckage, flowers grow
01:49 -- 01:54:  Bittersweet love, all we know
01:54 -- 01:58:  In the disarray, hearts beating fast
01:58 -- 02:05:  A beautiful mess, our love to last
02:05 -- 02:11:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrived
02:11 -- 02:16:  In chipped paint and neon lights we come alive
02:16 -- 02:24:  Love and imperfection, a story so old
02:24 -- 02:30:  In our disarray we found gold
02:30 -- 02:38:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrived
02:38 -- 02:43:  In chipped paint and neon lights we come alive
02:43 -- 02:51:  Love and imperfection, a story so old
02:51 -- 02:57:  In our disarray we found gold
03:08 -- 03:14:  In our disarray we found gold
03:14 -- 03:20:  In our disarray we found gold
03:20 -- 03:27:  In our disarray we found gold
03:38 -- 03:43:  Thanks for watching!
