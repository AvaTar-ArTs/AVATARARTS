00:00 -- 00:19:  Sammy sang in moonlit nights, with raccoon band and alley lights, love ballad soft in the dark, till one night love left a mark.
00:19 -- 00:39:  Howling cat took Sammy's throne, winning contest all alone, Sammy's heart was torn in twos, music now laced with blues.
00:39 -- 00:56:  Oh Sammy, why oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky, once you sang of love and life, now your songs bite in the night.
00:57 -- 01:13:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
01:14 -- 01:32:  Sammy's tunes have lost their glee, heartbreak under the willow tree, ballads now with teeth and claws, raccoons play with hidden flaws.
01:32 -- 01:50:  Moonlit alleys still remember, songs of love in soft September, Sammy sings with feral spite, turning love into a fight.
02:02 -- 02:25:  Oh Sammy, why oh why, did the alley cat steal your sky, once you sang of love and life, now your songs bite in the night.
02:26 -- 02:43:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
02:43 -- 02:59:  Raccoon band plays out of tune, since that fateful night in June, howling cat song took the crowd, left poor Sammy crying loud.
