00:00 -- 00:26:  In moonlit alleys we used to sing Now I roam these streets alone
00:26 -- 00:39:  Beneath the stars my heart it stings Darken nights I've always known
00:39 -- 00:51:  Love was sweet but now it's gone Echoes of a distant tune
00:51 -- 01:08:  Left me with this heavy gloom No more love songs in the night
01:08 -- 01:21:  Lonely echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
01:21 -- 01:33:  In this alleyway I hide Tried to win your heart in vain
01:33 -- 01:46:  Sung my soul beneath the moon But your love was just a chain
01:46 -- 01:58:  Now I howl a different tune No more kisses in the rain
01:58 -- 02:11:  Songs now laced with the pain Freedom found in broken chains
02:11 -- 02:24:  Knock on board, miss, start and sing No more love songs in the night
02:24 -- 02:37:  Lonely echoes of our fight Broken dreams they scatter white
02:37 -- 02:54:  In this alleyway I hide
