00:00 -- 00:26:  Soft piano chords with ambient text In the stillness of her mind, a rose blooms, secrets entwined
00:26 -- 00:37:  A tale as old as time unfolds, in silent dreams her heart holds
00:39 -- 00:45:  Behind closed eyes she sees the light, a spark within, burning bright
00:45 -- 00:53:  Those shadows dance and doubts arise, her soul reflects the starry skies
00:54 -- 01:05:  Beauty lies where none can see, within her heart, wild and free

01:18 -- 01:28:  Whispers of a distant song, echoes where she once belonged
01:28 -- 01:36:  Yearning for a world anew, a place where dreams might come true
01:36 -- 01:47:  Pedals fall yet roots remain, strength arising from the pain
01:47 -- 01:55:  In her silence stories grow, of love, of loss, of letting go
01:56 -- 02:07:  Beauty lies where none can see, within her heart, wild and free
02:07 -- 02:25:  Through every trial, every scar, she shines her own guiding star
02:26 -- 02:31:  Ooh, ooh
02:33 -- 02:43:  A tale as old as time they say, yet in her it's lived each day
02:43 -- 02:56:  No need for crowns or grand displays, her truth illuminates the way
