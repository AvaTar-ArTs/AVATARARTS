00:00 -- 00:06:  Lost in chase, dangling around that broken swing
00:06 -- 00:10:  Gilded rainbows when it falls clean
00:10 -- 00:14:  Statched up records for the same sad song
00:14 -- 00:21:  We danced in the shadows, where we both belong
00:21 -- 00:25:  Graffiti hearts are crumbling walls
00:25 -- 00:29:  Dated files in space pods
00:29 -- 00:33:  In the common streets we found our dreams
00:33 -- 00:37:  Embracing falls if a lover's blaze
00:37 -- 00:43:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive
00:43 -- 00:49:  In chips painted neon lights, we come alive
00:49 -- 00:54:  Love and imperfection, a story so old
00:54 -- 00:59:  In our disarray we found gold
01:13 -- 01:17:  Midnight whispers through shattered glass
01:17 -- 01:20:  Lost in the echoes of a broken past
01:20 -- 01:24:  Your wild laugh, my silent cry
01:24 -- 01:28:  In our barbed wire world, we touch the sky
01:28 -- 01:32:  Among the wreckage, flowers grow
01:32 -- 01:36:  Bittersweet might of all we wore
01:36 -- 01:40:  In a disarray, hearts beating fast
01:40 -- 01:43:  A beautiful mess, I love to mess
01:43 -- 01:48:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive
01:48 -- 01:54:  In chips painted neon lights, we come alive
01:54 -- 01:58:  Love and imperfection, a story so old
01:58 -- 02:03:  In our disarray we found gold
02:19 -- 02:23:  In a disarray, hearts beating fast
02:23 -- 02:27:  A beautiful mess, I love to mess
02:27 -- 02:31:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive
02:31 -- 02:35:  In a disarray, hearts beating fast
02:35 -- 02:39:  A beautiful mess, I love to mess
02:39 -- 02:44:  Beautiful mess, in the chaos we thrive
02:44 -- 02:47:  In a disarray
03:14 -- 03:19:  Thank you for watching!
