00:00 -- 00:19:  You're looking for something where Stacey becomes the centerpiece
00:19 -- 00:24:  Not just as a name, but as an emotional figure like Jolene or Hey
00:24 -- 00:29:  They're Lila, the name is part of the rhythm refrain
00:29 -- 00:34:  A story, a human pulse, but unlike Jolene or Delilah
00:34 -- 00:37:  This one should feel like it's singing to her
00:37 -- 00:39:  About her and for her
00:39 -- 00:44:  A voice of understanding watching her from across the years
00:44 -- 00:50:  Across the porch, across the silence
00:50 -- 00:53:  This version speaks her name like a sigh through screen doors
00:53 -- 00:57:  A song that could be playing on the kitchen radio
00:57 -- 01:04:  While she stares out across a long Ohio field
01:04 -- 01:07:  Stacey, the wind, don't ask why
01:07 -- 01:10:  It just moves quiet through the sky
01:10 -- 01:16:  And every porch in every town knows what it means to lay love
01:16 -- 01:19:  You kept your grace, you kept your place
01:19 -- 01:22:  You moved in silence, not in haste
01:22 -- 01:25:  The world don't see the wars you've won
01:25 -- 01:28:  They only hear what's come undone
01:28 -- 01:31:  But I've seen you through back screen doors
01:31 -- 01:34:  Still setting shoes near kitchen floors
01:34 -- 01:37:  Still folding years in linen drawers
01:37 -- 01:40:  Like love was worth the quiet wars
01:40 -- 01:43:  Stacey, the sky don't speak your name
01:43 -- 01:46:  But every sunset feels the same
01:46 -- 01:49:  Like something once was whole and wide
01:49 -- 01:52:  And now just waits on the inside
01:52 -- 01:55:  The wind, don't ask why
01:57 -- 02:01:  It just moves past with no goodbye
02:03 -- 02:06:  But I would stay if I were him
02:06 -- 02:11:  To feel the place your life's grown thin
02:22 -- 02:25:  You never asked for fire or gold
02:25 -- 02:28:  You just believed what you were told
02:28 -- 02:31:  And that belief still holds you fast
02:31 -- 02:34:  Through every ghost that won't look back
02:34 -- 02:36:  And maybe time forgets the good
02:36 -- 02:40:  But you're still here the way you stood
02:40 -- 02:43:  A woman shaped by storm and sun
02:43 -- 02:46:  Still steady long after he's gone
02:46 -- 02:51:  The wind, don't ask why
02:51 -- 02:57:  But maybe someone should have tried
02:57 -- 03:00:  To love you more than just enough
03:00 -- 03:06:  To stay through storms, not just the rain
