00:00 -- 00:27:  Once the soul of the alley howling cats
00:27 -- 00:40:  sung loud and strong echoing through moonlit nights heartbreak defiance in each note
00:42 -- 00:49:  Sammy's voice a story told crowds gathered truth unfold whispers through the midnight air
00:49 -- 00:54:  moonlit alley still we care
00:56 -- 01:04:  moonlit alley won't forget haunted by the songs we met
01:05 -- 01:13:  heart and soul in every beat Sammy's tune
01:14 -- 01:17:  bittersweet
01:19 -- 01:27:  each corner holds a ghostly dream melody we scream
01:28 -- 01:38:  we scream broken hearts played on the strings words of love and broken things
01:39 -- 01:49:  in the shadows memories stay howling cat that bluesy sway
01:50 -- 01:58:  music that we can't erase moonlit alley sacred place
02:09 -- 02:19:  moonlit alley won't forget haunted by the songs we met
02:20 -- 02:28:  heart and soul in every beat Sammy's tune
02:29 -- 02:32:  bittersweet
02:38 -- 02:40:  you
