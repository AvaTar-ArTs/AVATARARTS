00:00 -- 00:03:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud
00:03 -- 00:06:  It hurts beneath the silent shroud
00:06 -- 00:10:  But rage runs deep in family lines
00:10 -- 00:16:  Like rivers under faultless pines
00:21 -- 00:24:  Down roads no map remembers now
00:24 -- 00:28:  In fields the silos still allow
00:28 -- 00:31:  She lives between what was and is
00:31 -- 00:34:  Her silence names what memory
00:37 -- 00:41:  She walks a house not built with lies
00:41 -- 00:44:  But filled with echoes that don't die
00:44 -- 00:48:  His touch was shared not once, not small
00:48 -- 00:52:  With faces shaped by childhood's color
00:53 -- 00:56:  They laughed on beaches far from snow
00:56 -- 00:59:  While winter carved the porch below
00:59 -- 01:02:  Vacations bought with stolen breath
01:02 -- 01:07:  And family burned in quiet death
01:07 -- 01:11:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud
01:11 -- 01:14:  It hurts beneath the silent shroud
01:14 -- 01:17:  But rage runs deep in family lines
01:17 -- 01:21:  Like rivers under faultless pines
01:21 -- 01:24:  The grandkids smile from states away
01:24 -- 01:27:  Their photos hung and tucked away
01:27 -- 01:30:  She holds their joy like sacred dust
01:30 -- 01:36:  While others drowned her in their lust
01:39 -- 01:43:  Their shame he doesn't dare confess
01:43 -- 01:46:  A buoying grown-up's selfishness
01:46 -- 01:49:  The friend who played like time stood still
01:49 -- 01:54:  Now buried deep beneath her will
01:55 -- 01:58:  You'd never know the things she's lost
01:58 -- 02:01:  Her voice won't name the final cost
02:01 -- 02:05:  But look close in her kitchen light
02:05 -- 02:10:  You'll see a crown not made of white
02:10 -- 02:13:  The heartland doesn't scream or cry
02:13 -- 02:16:  But it remembers who and why
02:16 -- 02:20:  And when the family turns their heads
02:20 -- 02:23:  It's not from her, it's from the dead
02:23 -- 02:26:  Not death of flesh, but death of trust
02:26 -- 02:29:  The weight of promises to dust
02:29 -- 02:33:  Yet still she wakes and still she gives
02:33 -- 02:39:  In places most forgot she lives
02:41 -- 02:44:  Her children groan, their stories spun
02:44 -- 02:48:  But she's the thread through every one
02:48 -- 02:51:  And even when they drift or roam
02:51 -- 02:56:  They're written deep inside her home
02:56 -- 02:59:  The heartland doesn't beg or plead
02:59 -- 03:02:  It grows what's planted, pulls no weed
03:02 -- 03:06:  She's not a saint, she's not a ghost
03:06 -- 03:09:  But she's the one who hurts the most
03:09 -- 03:12:  A woman wronged, a soil kissed
03:12 -- 03:15:  By tears and time and all that's missed
03:15 -- 03:19:  Still standing where the quiet calls
03:19 -- 03:25:  With roots that reach through every wall
03:27 -- 03:34:  She never needed them to see in the dark
