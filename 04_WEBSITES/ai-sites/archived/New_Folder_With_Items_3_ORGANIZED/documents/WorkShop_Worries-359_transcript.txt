00:00 -- 00:28:  In a hidden workshop where magic resides Far from the world where the whispers hide
00:28 -- 00:41:  There toils Gympie, the woodcarver's hand Creating wonders that few understand
00:41 -- 00:46:  Workshop worries, who's messing with my tools?
00:46 -- 00:51:  Every night they're shifting, breaking all the rules
00:51 -- 01:08:  In Gympie's world of wood, the shadows play Mystery and mischief in the Twilight's way
01:08 -- 01:20:  Pencil-sized Santas and tiny Muppets too Each carved with precision and talent so true
01:20 -- 01:33:  In the darkness, something stirs and schemes A dance of rearrangement like mischievous dreams
01:33 -- 01:38:  Workshop worries, who's messing with my tools?
01:38 -- 01:44:  Every night they're shifting, breaking all the rules
01:44 -- 01:59:  In Gympie's world of wood, the shadows play Mystery and mischief in the Twilight's way
01:59 -- 02:10:  Spectacles perched as he scratches his head Waking each morning with feelings of dread
02:10 -- 02:26:  His artful figure seemed to come alive Secrets whispered as moonlight strides
02:26 -- 02:38:  Tools hide beneath the wood's embrace Invisible hands seem to leave no trace
02:38 -- 02:51:  Tiny figures gathered for secret games Gympie wonders who holds the reins
02:51 -- 02:56:  Workshop worries, who's messing with my tools?
02:56 -- 03:01:  Every night they're shifting, breaking all the rules
03:01 -- 03:16:  In Gympie's world of wood, the shadows play Mystery and mischief in the Twilight's way
03:16 -- 03:27:  Days turn to weeks in his enchanted place Ever a dance, a timeless chase
03:27 -- 03:43:  The riddle remains in the nighttime air Gympie's secret workshop beyond compare
03:43 -- 03:53:  Gather hair
03:57 -- 04:02:  Thanks for watching!
