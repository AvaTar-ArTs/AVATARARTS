00:00 -- 00:14:  ["Loud Are the Bells"]
00:14 -- 00:21:  Loud are the bells, King Henry is dead
00:21 -- 00:28:  The lands have been parted, in quarters they fell
00:28 -- 00:35:  Lion-hearted son, from his father did run
00:35 -- 00:43:  With every intention of taking the crown
00:43 -- 00:57:  For this house to live, there must be war
00:57 -- 01:11:  And so long as it stands, so must there be war
01:11 -- 01:18:  For a king must be bold, his kingdom will hold
01:18 -- 01:25:  Only as long as his legions are strong
01:25 -- 01:32:  And a king must be wise, or his kingdom will die
01:32 -- 01:40:  As the sands of time fall away
01:40 -- 01:54:  For this house to live, there must be war
01:54 -- 02:08:  And so long as it stands, so must there be war
02:08 -- 02:15:  See how they rise, and gather in droves
02:15 -- 02:23:  And take up the call, the king rides again
02:23 -- 02:29:  By the sword and the shield
02:29 -- 02:37:  For as long as I breathe, there will be war
02:37 -- 02:51:  For this house to live, there must be war
02:51 -- 03:14:  And so long as it stands, so must there be war
03:14 -- 03:21:  Thanks for watching!
