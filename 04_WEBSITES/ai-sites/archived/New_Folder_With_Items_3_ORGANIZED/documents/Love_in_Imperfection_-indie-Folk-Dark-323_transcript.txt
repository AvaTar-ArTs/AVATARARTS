00:26 -- 00:30:  Rusty chains tangled round a broken swing,
00:30 -- 00:35:  a dandelion blooms where the thorns cling.
00:35 -- 00:40:  Scratched up records play the same sad song.
00:40 -- 00:44:  We danced in shadows where we both belong.
00:44 -- 00:51:  Graffiti hearts on the crumbling walls, faded vows
00:51 -- 00:54:  and spray paint scrawls.
00:54 -- 00:59:  In the cluttered streets, we found our place,
00:59 -- 01:04:  embracing flaws in a lover's grace.
01:07 -- 01:15:  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive.
01:15 -- 01:21:  In chipped paint and neon lights,
01:21 -- 01:25:  we've come alive.
01:25 -- 01:35:  Oh, love and imperfection, a story so old.
01:35 -- 01:41:  In our disarray, we found gold.
01:51 -- 02:00:  Midnight whispers through shattered glass,
02:00 -- 02:04:  lost in the echoes of a broken past.
02:04 -- 02:10:  Your wild laugh, my silent cry.
02:10 -- 02:14:  In our barbed wire world, we touch the sky.
02:14 -- 02:19:  Among the wreckage, flowers grow.
02:19 -- 02:23:  Bittersweet love, oh, we know.
02:23 -- 02:28:  In the disarray, hearts beating fast.
02:28 -- 02:34:  A beautiful mess, our love to last.
02:35 -- 02:44:  Beautiful mess in the chaos we thrive.
02:44 -- 02:55:  In chipped paint and neon lights, we've come alive.
02:55 -- 03:02:  Oh, love and imperfection, a story so old.
03:04 -- 03:12:  In our disarray, we found gold.
