00:00 -- 00:19:  In the shadows is where I prowl, broken dreams like shattered glass, east of town.
00:19 -- 00:28:  We scavenge treasure from the tail of the city's frown, live fast, eat trash, beneath
00:28 -- 00:34:  the moon's hostile howl.
00:34 -- 00:46:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:46 -- 00:55:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps, rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped
00:55 -- 00:57:  in plastic wrap.
00:57 -- 01:04:  We're royalty of refused love in a discarded map.
01:04 -- 01:11:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:11 -- 01:17:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:17 -- 01:23:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight.
01:23 -- 01:32:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:32 -- 01:38:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles.
01:38 -- 01:44:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:45 -- 01:54:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waters, with every beat from the drum of an
01:54 -- 01:57:  empty milk bottle.
01:57 -- 02:08:  Stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony.
02:08 -- 02:15:  Romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:15 -- 02:21:  No fancy words nor clean papers decree.
02:21 -- 02:29:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:29 -- 02:36:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:36 -- 02:41:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
02:41 -- 02:47:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight.
02:47 -- 02:54:  We find love burning bright by the polluted light.
