01:36 -- 01:55:  In Gympie's world of wood the shadows play Mystery and mischief in the twilight sway
01:55 -- 02:07:  Spectacles perched as he scratches his head Waking each morning with feelings of dread
02:07 -- 02:21:  His artful figure seemed to come alive Secrets whispered as moonlight strives
02:21 -- 02:45:  Tools hide beneath the wood's embrace Invisible hands seem to leave no trace
