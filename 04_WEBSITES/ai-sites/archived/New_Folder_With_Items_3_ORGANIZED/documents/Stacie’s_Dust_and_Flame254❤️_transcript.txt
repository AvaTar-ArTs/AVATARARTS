00:00 -- 00:18:  There's a hush where a name won't go Where the weed burns down like it used to
00:18 -- 00:21:  know And the sun just sinks without a sound
00:21 -- 00:27:  Like it's waiting for her to come around
00:27 -- 00:33:  She lived in rooms that held too much And curtains softened, morning touch
00:33 -- 00:42:  Where love went quiet, slow and small And left its shoes in the upstairs hall
00:42 -- 00:48:  They say she had a voice like spring But sang in keys that pain would bring
00:48 -- 00:56:  And when he drove to the county line She sewed her silence into time
00:56 -- 01:08:  Stacey, oh, they built you wrong Taught you hush when you held strong
01:09 -- 01:19:  But you learned truth from dust and flame And now sorrow rises when they say your name
01:25 -- 01:31:  No calendar could mark the shift It wasn't war, it was the drift
01:32 -- 01:40:  She was the one who stayed when no one asked And stitched herself into the past
01:40 -- 01:46:  The porch still waits, the paint still peels The wind still talks in spinning wheels
01:46 -- 01:54:  And every mile they let her down It still follows her through empty towns
01:55 -- 02:05:  Stacey, oh, they built you wrong Taught you hush when you held strong
02:07 -- 02:17:  But you learned truth from dust and flame And now sorrow rises when they say your name
02:25 -- 02:35:  She doesn't haunt, she doesn't beg Just sips her coffee, bends her leg
02:35 -- 02:41:  And every morning breaks the same With nothing left to carry but her name
02:43 -- 02:51:  Stacey runs with the stillness now Not gone, just somewhere time wild
02:54 -- 02:57:  Thanks for watching!
