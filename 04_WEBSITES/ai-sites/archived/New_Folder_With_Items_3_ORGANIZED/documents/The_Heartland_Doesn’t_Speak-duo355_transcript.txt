00:00 -- 00:20:  Down roads no map remembers now In fields the silo's still allowed
00:20 -- 00:29:  It lives between what was and is Where silence names what memory missed
00:41 -- 00:46:  Once upon a time a happy ending Seemed not so far away
00:46 -- 00:51:  Like Belle within those roads three lives she grew
00:51 -- 00:54:  With hands that stitched the sky to blue
00:54 -- 01:00:  Kasia, Dakota, Austin the roots that whisper back her name
01:00 -- 01:06:  She walks a house not built with lies But filled with echoes that don't die
01:06 -- 01:13:  His touch was shared not once, not small With faces shaped by childhood's call
01:16 -- 01:21:  They laughed on beaches far from snow While winter carved the porch below
01:21 -- 01:28:  Vacations bought with stolen breath And family burned in quiet death
01:29 -- 01:34:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud It hurts beneath the silent shroud
01:34 -- 01:41:  But rage runs deep in family lines Like rivers under faultless pines
01:41 -- 01:49:  The grandkids smile from states away Their photos hung then tucked away
01:49 -- 01:56:  She holds their joy like sacred dust While others drown her in their lust
01:56 -- 02:02:  The shame he doesn't dare confess A buoyant grown-up's selfishness
02:02 -- 02:09:  The friend who played like time stood still Now buried deep beneath her will
02:12 -- 02:20:  You never know the things she's lost Her voice won't name the final cost
02:20 -- 02:27:  But look close in her kitchen light You'll see a crown not made of white
02:27 -- 02:33:  The heartland doesn't scream or cry But it remembers who and why
02:33 -- 02:40:  And when the family turns their heads It's not from her, it's from the dead
02:42 -- 02:48:  Not death of flesh but death of trust The weight of promises to dust
02:48 -- 02:55:  Yet still she wakes and still she gives And places most for God she leaves
02:55 -- 03:01:  Her children groan, their stories spun But she's the thread through every one
03:01 -- 03:08:  And even when they drift or roam They're written deep inside her home
03:09 -- 03:14:  The heartland doesn't beg or plead It grows what's planted, pulls no weed
03:14 -- 03:20:  She's not a saint, she's not a ghost But she's the one who hurts the most
03:23 -- 03:28:  A woman wronged, a soil kissed By tears and time and all that's missed
03:28 -- 03:35:  Still standing where the quiet calls With roots that reach through every wall
03:35 -- 03:49:  Ooh, she never needed them to see The truth was hers and always free
