00:00 -- 00:08:  In the stillness of her mind
00:08 -- 00:14:  Rose blooms, secrets entwine
00:14 -- 00:20:  A tale as old as time unfolds
00:20 -- 00:27:  In silent dreams her heart holds
00:28 -- 00:35:  Behind closed eyes she sees the light
00:35 -- 00:41:  A spark within, burning bright
00:41 -- 00:48:  Though shadows dance and doubts arise
00:48 -- 00:55:  Her soul reflects the starry skies
00:55 -- 01:01:  Beauty lies where none can see
01:01 -- 01:08:  Within her heart, wild and free
01:08 -- 01:15:  Through every trial, every scar
01:15 -- 01:21:  She shines, her own guiding star
01:21 -- 01:28:  Whispers of a distant song
01:28 -- 01:35:  Echoes where she once belonged
01:35 -- 01:41:  Yearning for a world anew
01:41 -- 01:48:  A place where dreams might come true
01:48 -- 01:51:  Petals fall yet roots remain
01:51 -- 01:54:  Strength arising from the pain
01:54 -- 01:58:  In her silence stories grow
01:58 -- 02:01:  Of love, of loss, of letting go
02:01 -- 02:07:  Beauty lies where none can see
02:07 -- 02:14:  Within her heart, wild and free
02:14 -- 02:21:  Through every trial, every scar
02:21 -- 02:27:  She shines, her own guiding star
02:30 -- 02:37:  A tale as old as time they say
02:37 -- 02:43:  Yet in her it's lived each day
02:43 -- 02:50:  No need for crowns or grand displays
02:50 -- 02:57:  Her truth illuminates the way
