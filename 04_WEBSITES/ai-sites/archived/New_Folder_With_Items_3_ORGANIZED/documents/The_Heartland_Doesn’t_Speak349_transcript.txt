00:00 -- 00:18:  Down roads no map remembers now In fields the silos still allow
00:18 -- 00:25:  She lives between what was and is Where silence names what memory
00:25 -- 00:31:  Stacey and three lives she grew With hands that stitch the sky to blue
00:31 -- 00:41:  Kasia, Dakota, Austin flame The roots that whisper back her name
00:41 -- 00:47:  She walks a house not filled with lies But filled with echoes that don't die
00:47 -- 00:56:  His touch was shared not once, not small With faces shaped by childhood's call
00:56 -- 01:02:  They laughed on beaches far from snow A winter car of the porch below
01:02 -- 01:11:  Vacations bought with stolen breath And family burned in quiet death
01:11 -- 01:18:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud It hurts beneath the silent shroud
01:18 -- 01:30:  Her rage runs deep and family aligns Like rivers under faultless high
01:30 -- 01:36:  The grandkids smile from states away Their photos hung and tucked away
01:36 -- 01:44:  She holds her joy like sacred dust While others drown her in their lust
01:44 -- 01:50:  The shame he doesn't dare confess A boy in grown-up selfishness
01:50 -- 01:59:  The friend who played like time stood still Now buried deep beneath her will
01:59 -- 02:04:  You never know the things she's lost Her voice won't name the final cost
02:04 -- 02:13:  But look close in her kitchen light You'll see a crown not made of white
02:15 -- 02:21:  The heartland doesn't scream or cry But it remembers who and why
02:21 -- 02:28:  And when the family turns their heads It's not from her, it's from the dead
02:28 -- 02:34:  Not death of flesh, but death of trust The weight of promises to dust
02:34 -- 02:40:  Yet still she wakes and still she gives In places most forgot she leaves
02:40 -- 02:46:  Her children grown, their stories spun But she's the thread through everyone
02:46 -- 02:53:  And even when they drift or roam They're written deep inside her home
02:56 -- 03:02:  The heartland doesn't beg or plead It grows what's planted, pulls no weed
03:02 -- 03:09:  She's not a saint, she's not a ghost But she's the one who hurts the most
03:21 -- 03:27:  A woman wronged, a soil kissed By tears and time and all that's missed
03:27 -- 03:34:  Still standing where the quiet calls With roots that reach through every wall
03:34 -- 03:46:  She never needed them to see The truth was hers and always free
