# Batch Gallery Generator

A Python script that automatically scans your Pictures directory and creates Simple Photo Gallery instances for each subdirectory containing images.

## Features

- **Recursive Scanning**: Automatically finds all directories with images
- **Batch Processing**: Creates galleries for multiple directories at once
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview what will be created without making changes
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if some galleries fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs of the process
- **Force Mode**: Overwrite existing galleries if needed

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Scan all directories in Pictures and create galleries
python batch_gallery_generator.py

# Scan a specific directory
python batch_gallery_generator.py --pictures-path "/path/to/your/images"

# Preview what would be created (dry run)
python batch_gallery_generator.py --dry-run

# Force reinitialize existing galleries
python batch_gallery_generator.py --force
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Force regeneration of thumbnails
python batch_gallery_generator.py --force-thumbnails

# Limit directory depth
python batch_gallery_generator.py --max-depth 5

# Process specific directory with force
python batch_gallery_generator.py --pictures-path "/Users/steven/Pictures/MyCollection" --force
```

## Examples

### Process all directories in Pictures
```bash
python batch_gallery_generator.py
```

### Process only a specific folder
```bash
python batch_gallery_generator.py --pictures-path "/Users/steven/Pictures/MyCollection"
```

### Preview what would be created
```bash
python batch_gallery_generator.py --dry-run
```

### Force reinitialize existing galleries
```bash
python batch_gallery_generator.py --force
```

## Output

The script will create the following structure in each directory with images:

```
MyCollection/
├── gallery.json          # Gallery configuration
├── images_data.json      # Image metadata
├── public/               # Public files
│   ├── index.html       # Main gallery page
│   └── images/
│       ├── photos/      # Original images
│       └── thumbnails/  # Generated thumbnails
└── templates/           # Gallery templates
```

## Logging

The script creates detailed logs in:
- `gallery_generation.log` - File log
- Console output - Real-time progress

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Simple Photo Gallery installed in your miniforge environment
- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing

## Troubleshooting

### Gallery already exists
Use `--force` to overwrite existing galleries:
```bash
python batch_gallery_generator.py --force
```

### Module not found errors
Make sure you're running the script from the correct directory and that Simple Photo Gallery is installed in your miniforge environment.

### Permission errors
Make sure you have write permissions to the directories you're processing.

## Tips

1. **Start with dry run**: Always use `--dry-run` first to see what will be created
2. **Process in batches**: For large directories, consider processing smaller subsets
3. **Check logs**: Review the log file if you encounter errors
4. **Backup important data**: Consider backing up important images before processing

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the log file for detailed error messages
2. Try running with `--dry-run` first
3. Use `--force` if galleries already exist
4. Verify Simple Photo Gallery is properly installed
