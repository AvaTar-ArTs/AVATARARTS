00:00 -- 00:27:  In the stillness of her mind A rose blooms, secrets entwined
00:27 -- 00:38:  A tale as old as time unfolds In silent dreams her heart holds
00:58 -- 01:03:  Behind closed eyes she sees the light A spark within, burning bright
01:03 -- 01:15:  Those shadows dance and doubts arise Her soul reflects the starry skies
01:15 -- 01:25:  Beauty lies where none can see Within her heart, wild and free
01:25 -- 01:40:  Through every trial, every scar She shines, her own guiding star
01:55 -- 02:06:  Whispers of a distant song Echoes where she once belonged
02:06 -- 02:20:  Yearning for a world anew A place where dreams might come true
02:20 -- 02:35:  Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah
02:35 -- 02:46:  Petals fall yet roots remain Strength arising from the pain
02:46 -- 03:00:  In her silence stories grow Of love, of loss, of letting go
03:00 -- 03:10:  Beauty lies where none can see Within her heart, wild and free
03:10 -- 03:25:  Through every trial, every scar She shines, her own guiding star
03:25 -- 03:46:  Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah
03:46 -- 03:56:  A tale as old as time they say Yet in her it's lived each day
03:56 -- 04:06:  No need for crowns or grand displays Her truth illuminates the way
04:06 -- 04:28:  Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah
