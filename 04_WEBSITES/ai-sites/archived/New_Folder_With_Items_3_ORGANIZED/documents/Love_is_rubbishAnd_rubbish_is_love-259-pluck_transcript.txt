00:00 -- 00:08:  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love
00:20 -- 00:25:  Ain't no diamond, no pearl, but a cracked old stone
00:26 -- 00:30:  We wander through the trash, make this mess our own
00:30 -- 00:34:  By the dumpster fire, found a spark of light
00:35 -- 00:39:  In the ruins of the day, you became my night
00:43 -- 00:47:  Torn up boots, dancing on the cracked up streets
00:47 -- 00:52:  In the heart of the grime, our broken hearts meet
00:52 -- 00:56:  Jagged edges fit like puzzle pieces worn
00:56 -- 01:01:  From the chaos and the clutter, a new love born
01:02 -- 01:08:  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love
01:08 -- 01:13:  In the scraps of this world, we find our above
01:13 -- 01:17:  A tangle of the broken, a harmony tough
01:17 -- 01:26:  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love
01:37 -- 01:41:  Feety walls, whispered tales of the past
01:41 -- 01:46:  In the wreckage of our dreams, we built something that lasts
01:46 -- 01:50:  Your eyes, a beacon in the disarray
01:51 -- 01:54:  Even in the rubbish, we found our way
01:59 -- 02:03:  Rust and rubble, no polishing
02:03 -- 02:07:  In the imperfections, we create the scene
02:08 -- 02:12:  A symphony of flaws, a love unforeseen
02:12 -- 02:16:  In the heart of the trash, we're the beauty in between
02:19 -- 02:24:  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love
02:24 -- 02:29:  In the patches and the pieces, we rise above
02:29 -- 02:33:  A mosaic of the shattered lines, rough
02:33 -- 02:43:  Love is rubbish and rubbish is love
