00:00 -- 00:18:  Down roads no map remembers now In fields the silos still allow
00:18 -- 00:25:  She lives between what was and is Where silence names what memory missed
00:25 -- 00:31:  Once upon a time a happy ending Seemed not so far away
00:31 -- 00:35:  Like Belle within those roads three lives she grew
00:35 -- 00:40:  With hands that stitched the sky to blue
00:40 -- 00:49:  Cause you're Dakota, Austin flame The roots that whisper back her name
00:49 -- 00:55:  She walks a house not built with lies But filled with echoes that don't die
00:55 -- 01:04:  His touch was shared not once, not small With faces shaped by childhood's call
01:04 -- 01:11:  They laughed on beaches far from snow While winter carved the porch below
01:11 -- 01:20:  Vacations bought with stolen breath And family burned in quiet death
01:20 -- 01:26:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud It hurts beneath the silent shroud
01:26 -- 01:38:  But rage runs deep in family lines Like rivers under faultless pines
01:38 -- 01:44:  The grandkids smile from states away Their photos hung then tucked away
01:44 -- 01:52:  She holds their joy like sacred dust While others drowned her in their lust
01:52 -- 01:58:  Their shame he doesn't dare confess A boy in grown-up selfishness
01:58 -- 02:06:  The friend who played like time stood still Now buried deep beneath her will
02:06 -- 02:12:  You never know the things she's lost Her voice won't name the final cost
02:12 -- 02:22:  But look close in her kitchen light You'll see a crown not made of white
02:22 -- 02:29:  The heartland doesn't scream or cry But it remembers who and why
02:29 -- 02:35:  And when the family turns their heads It's not from her, it's from the dead
02:35 -- 02:41:  Not death of flesh, but death of trust The weight of promises to dust
02:41 -- 02:47:  Yet still she wakes and still she gives In places most forgot she lives
02:47 -- 02:53:  Her children groan, their stories spun But she's the thread through everyone
02:53 -- 03:02:  And even when they drift or roam They're written deep inside her home
03:02 -- 03:08:  The heartland doesn't beg or plead It grows what's planted, pulls no weed
03:08 -- 03:15:  She's not a saint, she's not a ghost But she's the one who hurts the most
03:27 -- 03:33:  A woman wronged, a soil kissed By tears and time and all that's missed
03:33 -- 03:39:  Still standing where the quiet calls With roots that reach through every wall
03:39 -- 03:49:  She never needed them to see The truth was hers and always free
