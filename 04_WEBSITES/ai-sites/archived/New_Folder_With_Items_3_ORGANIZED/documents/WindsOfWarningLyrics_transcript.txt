00:00 -- 00:17:  There's a murmur in the market, a shiver through the stone
00:17 -- 00:26:  The statues in the courtyard look colder than I've known
00:27 -- 00:36:  The sky has turned a deeper shade, the candles flicker strange
00:36 -- 00:43:  And yet I call it nothing, just weather, nothing's changed
00:45 -- 00:54:  But whispers thread through every gate
00:54 -- 01:02:  Their silence speaks, their silence wins
01:02 -- 01:11:  Still I stand, the storm won't shake me
01:11 -- 01:19:  Winds of warning cannot break me
01:19 -- 01:24:  I am the law, the blade, the flame
01:24 -- 01:29:  Let them curse my hollow name
01:29 -- 01:33:  Let them tremble in their sleep
01:33 -- 01:39:  This throne is mine, this rule is deep
01:39 -- 01:44:  They chant and cry beyond my doors
01:44 -- 01:53:  But I've survived a thousand wars
01:53 -- 02:02:  My generals grow cautious, their eyes refuse to meet
02:02 -- 02:11:  The court speaks in rehearsed lines, with poison in their speech
02:11 -- 02:20:  The bells no longer ring for joy, their tolls grow short and sharp
02:20 -- 02:29:  Yet I refuse to bend my knee to common hearts and harps
02:29 -- 02:38:  They think me deaf, they think me blind
02:38 -- 02:46:  But I can see the traitor's side
02:46 -- 02:55:  Still I stand, the storm won't shake me
02:55 -- 03:03:  Winds of warning cannot break me
03:03 -- 03:08:  I am the wall, I am the flame
03:08 -- 03:13:  Let them spit upon my name
03:13 -- 03:17:  Let them carve it in the dirt
03:17 -- 03:23:  This rule is mine, I feel no hurt
03:23 -- 03:28:  The sky may split, the ground may groan
03:28 -- 03:34:  But they'll not take my golden throne
03:34 -- 03:42:  Justice, justice, justice, justice
03:42 -- 03:47:  The banners twitch, the air is thin
03:47 -- 03:51:  The war is near, but not within
03:51 -- 03:56:  I clench the scepter in my hand
03:56 -- 04:02:  A king must never let them stand
04:02 -- 04:11:  Still I...
04:11 -- 04:20:  Still I...
04:20 -- 04:29:  Still I...
04:29 -- 04:37:  Still I...
04:37 -- 04:42:  Stand!
