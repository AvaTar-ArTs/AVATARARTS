# The 9MB Rule That Saves Etsy Listings (60s)
**Hook (0–3s):** On‑screen text: *“Your Etsy images keep failing? 1 rule.”*  
**VO:** “Your Etsy upload keeps yelling ‘image too large’? Here’s the 9MB rule.”

**Scene 1 (4–10s):** Screen recording of huge PNG.  
**VO:** “Most listings die because images are heavy. Target **~9MB**. Looks the same, uploads first try.”

**Scene 2 (11–25s):** Quick demo compressing a folder.  
**VO:** “Drop your folder into **AA‑8MB Squisher**. It batch‑compresses to ~8–9MB without wrecking detail.”

**Scene 3 (26–40s):** Before/after zoom on details.  
**VO:** “Quality’s safe, file size tiny. Boom — faster loads, higher conversion.”

**Scene 4 (41–55s):** Title/tag overlay ideas.  
**VO:** “Pair with tags like *etsy image size*, *print on demand*, *seo listing*.”

**CTA (56–60s):** On‑screen button: *“Grab the compressor • link in bio”*  
**Hashtags:** #etsy #printondemand #images #seo #creatorops
