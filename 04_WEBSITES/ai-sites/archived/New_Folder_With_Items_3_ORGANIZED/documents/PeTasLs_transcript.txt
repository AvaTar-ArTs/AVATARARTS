00:00 -- 00:29:  In the stillness of her mind, a rose blooms, secrets entwined.
00:29 -- 00:48:  A tale as old as time unfolds, in silent dreams her heart holds.
00:48 -- 00:57:  Behind closed eyes she sees the light, a spark within, burning bright.
00:57 -- 01:07:  Though shadows dance and doubts arise, her soul reflects the starry skies.
01:07 -- 01:16:  Beauty lies where none can see, within her heart, wild and free.
01:16 -- 01:33:  Through every trial, every scar, she shines her own guiding star.
01:33 -- 01:41:  Whispers of a distant song, echoes where she once belonged.
01:42 -- 01:50:  Yearning for a world anew, a place where dreams might come true.
01:50 -- 02:00:  Petals fall, yet roots remain, strength arising from the pain.
02:00 -- 02:09:  In her silence stories grow, of love, of loss, of letting go.
02:09 -- 02:19:  A tale as old as time they say, yet in her it's lived each day.
02:19 -- 02:38:  No need for crowns or grand displays, her truth illuminates the way.
