00:00 -- 00:15:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of town, we scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown.
00:16 -- 00:24:  Live fast, eat trash, beneath the moon's hostile howl.
00:30 -- 00:50:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap.
00:51 -- 00:57:  She hums the blues of a life caught in the traps.
00:58 -- 01:06:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap.
01:07 -- 01:14:  We're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded map.
01:15 -- 01:22:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
01:23 -- 01:29:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
01:32 -- 01:45:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight, we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:53 -- 01:57:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles.
01:58 -- 02:01:  We drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
02:02 -- 02:07:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles.
02:08 -- 02:16:  With every beat from the drum of an empty milk bottle.
02:17 -- 02:25:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony.
02:26 -- 02:33:  Our romance is feral, wild as the wind, unchained, free.
02:34 -- 02:39:  No fancy words, nor clean papers decree.
02:40 -- 02:45:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris.
02:47 -- 02:54:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:55 -- 03:02:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight.
03:05 -- 03:12:  With dumpsters for a throne and cans filled with delight,
03:12 -- 03:18:  we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
03:42 -- 03:48:  Thanks for watching!
