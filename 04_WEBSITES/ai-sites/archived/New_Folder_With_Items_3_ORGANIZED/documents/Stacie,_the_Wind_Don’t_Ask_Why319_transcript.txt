00:00 -- 00:17:  You're looking for something where Stacey becomes the centerpiece
00:17 -- 00:24:  Not just as a name but as an emotional figure like Jolene or Hay
00:24 -- 00:31:  Dear Delilah, the name is part of the rhythm Refrain and soul of the story a human pulse
00:31 -- 00:40:  But unlike Jolene or Delilah This one should feel like it's singing to
00:40 -- 00:46:  her, about her, and for her A voice of understanding watching her
00:46 -- 00:53:  From across the years, across the porch, across the silence
00:53 -- 00:58:  This version speaks her name Like a sigh through screen doors
00:58 -- 01:01:  A song that could be playing on the kitchen radio
01:01 -- 01:05:  While she stares out across a long Ohio field
01:05 -- 01:11:  Says, see the wind, don't ask why It just moves quiet through the sky
01:11 -- 01:22:  And every porch in every town Knows what it means to lay love down
01:22 -- 01:28:  You kept your grace, you kept your place You moved in silence, not in haste
01:28 -- 01:35:  The world don't see the wars you've won They only hear what's come undone
01:35 -- 01:41:  But I've seen you through back screen doors Still setting shoes near kitchen floors
01:41 -- 01:49:  Still folding mirrors in linen drawers Like love was worth the quiet wars
01:49 -- 01:55:  Say, see the sky, don't speak your name But every sunset feels the same
01:55 -- 02:01:  Like something once was whole and wide And now just waits on the inside
02:01 -- 02:06:  The wind, don't ask why It just moves past with no goodbye
02:06 -- 02:13:  But I would stay if I were him To feel the place your life's grown thin
02:13 -- 02:19:  You never asked for fire or gold You just believed what you were told
02:19 -- 02:30:  And that belief still holds you fast Through every ghost that won't look back
02:30 -- 02:36:  And maybe time forgets the good But you're still here the way you stood
02:36 -- 02:44:  A woman shaped by storm and sun Still steady long after he's gone
02:44 -- 02:50:  The wind, don't ask why But maybe someone should have tried
02:50 -- 02:59:  To love you more than just enough To stay through storms, not just the rough
