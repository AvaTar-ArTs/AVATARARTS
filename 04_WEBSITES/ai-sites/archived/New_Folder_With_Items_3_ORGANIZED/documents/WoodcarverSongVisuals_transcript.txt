00:00 -- 00:19:  In the shadows where secrets are laid, a driving rhythm starts to play,
00:19 -- 00:27:  Gritty strings and whispered tales, a woodcarver's world where mystery prevails.
00:31 -- 00:42:  Spars and raw inner verses, tight percussion speaks, electric accents dance through the piece.
00:44 -- 00:57:  When the chorus hits, it swells and soars, harmonies lift, unleashing the core.
00:57 -- 01:04:  A cruisin' groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise,
01:04 -- 01:10:  manga dreams in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertone.
01:10 -- 01:28:  Lo-fi layers, grunge beats bold, a hidden world with tales untold,
01:28 -- 01:36:  distorted strums through the dark oak wood, electric whispers where the carver stood.
01:41 -- 01:53:  Western winds and a violin's trace, E minor chords in vast reverb space,
01:53 -- 02:13:  clean undresses tremble and hum, echoes of the tools the shadows have worn.
02:23 -- 02:29:  Harmonicas wail in rooty tones, while manga effects set the restless bones.
02:29 -- 02:35:  Lousy spirits haunt the nights, a cinematic dance in mysterious lights.
02:35 -- 02:42:  A cruisin' groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise,
02:42 -- 02:48:  manga dreams in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertone.
02:48 -- 02:54:  In the hidden workshops, endless game, unseen hands give life and claim.
02:54 -- 03:06:  Echoing through songs of earthly lore, Kimpy's world darkened forevermore.
03:09 -- 03:11:  We will rise.
03:18 -- 03:20:  We will rise.
