00:00 -- 00:05:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love

00:32 -- 00:36:  Torn up boots dancing on the cracked up streets
00:36 -- 00:39:  In the heart of the grime
00:39 -- 00:41:  Our broken hearts meet
00:41 -- 00:43:  Jagged edges fit
00:43 -- 00:48:  Like puzzle pieces worn from the chaos and the clutter
00:48 -- 00:50:  A new love born
00:50 -- 00:55:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love
00:55 -- 00:57:  In the scraps of this world
00:57 -- 01:00:  We find our above
01:00 -- 01:02:  A tangle of the broken
01:02 -- 01:04:  A harmony tough
01:04 -- 01:08:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love

01:12 -- 01:14:  Graffiti walls
01:14 -- 01:16:  Whisper tales of the past
01:16 -- 01:18:  In the wreckage of our dreams
01:18 -- 01:22:  We built something that lasts your eyes
01:22 -- 01:26:  A beacon in the disarray
01:26 -- 01:28:  Even in the rubbish
01:28 -- 01:30:  We found our way
01:30 -- 01:39:  🎵
01:39 -- 01:40:  Rust and rubble
01:40 -- 01:43:  No polishing
01:43 -- 01:45:  In the imperfections
01:45 -- 01:48:  We create the scene
01:48 -- 01:50:  A symphony of flaws
01:50 -- 01:52:  A love unforeseen
01:52 -- 01:54:  In the heart of the trash
01:54 -- 01:57:  Where the beauty in between
01:57 -- 02:01:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love
02:01 -- 02:04:  In the patches and the pieces
02:04 -- 02:06:  We rise above
02:06 -- 02:09:  A mosaic of the shattered
02:09 -- 02:11:  Lines rough
02:11 -- 02:15:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love
