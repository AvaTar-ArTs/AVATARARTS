00:00 -- 00:18:  In the shadows where the alley cats prowl, broken dreams and shattered glass, east of
00:18 -- 00:19:  town.
00:19 -- 00:24:  We scavenge treasure from the tale of the city's frown, live fast, eat trash beneath
00:24 -- 00:27:  the moon's hostile howl.
00:27 -- 00:37:  By the fire's orange glow, our kingdom rises from the scrap, she hums the blues of a life
00:37 -- 00:38:  caught in the traps.
00:38 -- 00:47:  Rusty hearts beating in sync, wrapped in plastic wrap, we're royalty of refuse, love in a discarded
00:47 -- 00:48:  map.
00:48 -- 00:52:  Love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
00:52 -- 00:59:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, with dumpsters for a throne and cans filled
00:59 -- 01:06:  with delight, we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
01:22 -- 01:32:  Her eyes are diamonds among the broken bottles, we drink cheap wine from a paper bag throttle.
01:32 -- 01:38:  Stories of old stardust told in street lamp waddles with every beat from the drum of an
01:38 -- 01:40:  empty milk bottle.
01:40 -- 01:49:  The stray dogs bark a mournful tune, alley symphony, our romance is feral.
01:49 -- 01:55:  Wild as the wind, unchained, free, no fancy words, no clean papers decree.
01:55 -- 02:04:  In the trash we thrive, hearts wild and debris, love is rubbish, let's get trashy in the moonlight.
02:04 -- 02:11:  Kings and queens of litter in the city's blight, with dumpsters for a throne and cans filled
02:11 -- 02:18:  with delight, we find love burning bright by the polluted light.
