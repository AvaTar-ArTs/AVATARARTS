00:00 -- 00:27:  Aint no diamond, no pearl, but a cracker, a cracker, a cracker, a cracker, a cracker,
00:27 -- 00:31:  Aint no diamond, no pearl, but a cracked old stone.
00:31 -- 00:35:  We wander through the trash, make this mess our own,
00:35 -- 00:45:  By the dumpster fire, found a spark of light, In the ruins of the day you became my night.
00:45 -- 01:02:  Torn up boots, dancing on the cracked up streets, In the heart of the grime, our broken hearts
01:02 -- 01:03:  meet.
01:03 -- 01:11:  Jagged edges fit, like puzzle pieces worn, From the chaos and the clutter, a new love
01:11 -- 01:12:  born.
01:12 -- 01:20:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love, In the scraps of this world we find our above,
01:20 -- 01:39:  A tangle of the broken, a harmony tough, Love is rubbish is love, ish is love.
01:39 -- 01:46:  Graffiti walls whisper, tales of the past, In the wreckage of our dreams, we built something
01:46 -- 01:54:  that lasts your eyes, A beacon in the disarray, even in the rubbish
01:54 -- 01:57:  we found our way.
01:57 -- 02:05:  Rust and rubble, no polishing, In the imperfections we create the scene,
02:05 -- 02:12:  A symphony of flaws, a love unforeseen, In the heart of the trash, we're the beauty
02:12 -- 02:13:  in between.
02:13 -- 02:22:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love, In the patches and the pieces we rise above,
02:22 -- 02:32:  A mosaic of the shattered lines rough, Love is rubbish is love, ish is love.
02:35 -- 02:39:  Love is rubbish is love, ish is love.
