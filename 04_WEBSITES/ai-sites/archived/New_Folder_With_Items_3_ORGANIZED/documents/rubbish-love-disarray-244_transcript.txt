00:00 -- 00:08:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love.

00:29 -- 00:34:  Ain't no diamond, no pearl, but a cracked old stone.
00:34 -- 00:38:  We wandered through the trash, make this mess our own.
00:38 -- 00:42:  By the dumpster fire, found a spark of light.
00:42 -- 00:48:  In the ruins of the day, you became my night.
00:48 -- 00:55:  guitar
00:55 -- 01:00:  Torn up boots, dancing on the cracked up streets.
01:00 -- 01:04:  In the heart of the grime, our broken hearts meet.
01:04 -- 01:08:  Jagged edges fit like puzzle pieces worn.
01:08 -- 01:13:  From the chaos and the clutter, a new love born.
01:13 -- 01:17:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love.
01:17 -- 01:22:  In the scraps of this world, we find our above.
01:22 -- 01:26:  A tangle of the broken, a harmony tough.
01:26 -- 01:33:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love.
01:33 -- 01:35:  guitar
01:35 -- 01:39:  Graffiti walls whisper tales of the past.
01:39 -- 01:43:  In the wreckage of our dreams, we built something that lasts.
01:43 -- 01:48:  Your eyes, a beacon in the disarray.
01:48 -- 01:53:  Even in the rubbish, we found our way.
01:53 -- 02:01:  guitar
02:01 -- 02:05:  Rust and rubble, no polishing.
02:05 -- 02:10:  In the imperfections, we create the scene.
02:10 -- 02:14:  A symphony of flaws, a love unforeseen.
02:14 -- 02:18:  In the heart of the trash, we're the beauty in between.
02:18 -- 02:23:  Love is rubbish, and rubbish is love.
02:23 -- 02:27:  In the patches and the pieces, we rise above.
02:27 -- 02:31:  A mosaic of the shattered lines.
02:31 -- 02:42:  Rust and rub, love is rubbish, and rubbish is love.
