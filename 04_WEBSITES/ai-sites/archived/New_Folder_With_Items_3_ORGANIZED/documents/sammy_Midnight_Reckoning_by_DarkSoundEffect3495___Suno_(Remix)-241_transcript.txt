00:00 -- 00:18:  Once the soul of the alley, howling catsong
00:18 -- 00:26:  Loud and strong, echoing through moonlit nights
00:26 -- 00:34:  Heartbreak, defiance in each note
00:34 -- 00:39:  Sammy's voice, a story told
00:39 -- 00:44:  Crowds gather, truth unfold
00:44 -- 00:47:  Whispers through the midnight air
00:47 -- 00:52:  Moonly alley, still we care
00:53 -- 00:57:  Moonly alley, won't forget
00:57 -- 01:02:  Haunted by the songs we met
01:02 -- 01:06:  Heart and soul in every beat
01:06 -- 01:08:  Sammy's tune
01:11 -- 01:13:  Bittersweet
01:13 -- 01:26:  Each corner holds a ghostly dream
01:26 -- 01:30:  Melody, we scream, we scream
01:30 -- 01:35:  Broken hearts played on the strings
01:35 -- 01:39:  Words of love and broken things
01:39 -- 01:45:  In the shadows, memories stay
01:48 -- 01:54:  Howling cat that blues is swayed
01:57 -- 02:02:  Music that we can't erase
02:02 -- 02:06:  Moonly alley, sacred place
02:06 -- 02:11:  Moonly alley, won't forget
02:11 -- 02:15:  Haunted by the songs we met
02:15 -- 02:19:  Heart and soul in every beat
02:19 -- 02:21:  Sammy's tune
02:24 -- 02:26:  Bittersweet
02:36 -- 02:41:  Thank you for watching!
