00:00 -- 00:24:  In the dead of night, where shadows play, Lies a world forsaken in a dying day.
00:25 -- 00:42:  The wind, it howls like a beast unchained, As the darkness closes in like a shroud o'er the plain.
00:44 -- 00:51:  In this fleeting light, I'm lost and alone.
00:54 -- 01:01:  With no respite from the demons that have made my home.
01:04 -- 01:20:  Oh, the reckoning comes like a stormy night, When all my sins are weighing me down to the ground tonight.
01:25 -- 01:44:  The gunslingers roam in search of their prey, Seeking justice or so they claim, but what do we say?
01:44 -- 02:03:  To those who walk the line between good and evil's door, When darkness reigns supreme as it does once more.
02:06 -- 02:13:  In this fleeting light, I'm lost and alone.
02:15 -- 02:23:  With no respite from the demons that have made my home.
02:25 -- 02:42:  Oh, the reckoning comes like a stormy night, When all my sins are weighing me down to the ground tonight.
02:44 -- 03:06:  The midnight sun, it sets once more, And I am left with nothing but the shadows' score.
03:14 -- 03:16:  Thanks for watching!
