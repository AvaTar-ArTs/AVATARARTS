00:00 -- 00:22:  In the shadows where secrets lay, a driving rhythm starts to play
00:22 -- 00:37:  Gritty strings and whispered tales, a woodcarver's world where mystery prevails
00:38 -- 00:51:  Sparse and raw in the verses, tight percussion speaks, electric accents dance through the peaks
00:52 -- 01:07:  When the chorus hits, it swells and soars, harmonies lift, unleashing the chord
01:07 -- 01:20:  A proust and groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise
01:20 -- 01:36:  Manga dreams in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertow
01:37 -- 01:44:  Lo-fi layers, grunge beats bold, a hidden world with tales untold
01:44 -- 02:02:  Distorted strums through the dark oak wood, electric whispers where the covers stood
02:02 -- 02:15:  Western winds and a violin's trace, E minor chords in vast reverb space, clean andresials tremble and hum
02:15 -- 02:25:  Echoes of the tools the shadows have won
02:25 -- 02:38:  Harmonies wail in moody tones, while manga effects set the restless bones
02:38 -- 02:54:  Spoozy spirits haunt the nights, a cinematic dance in mysterious lights
02:54 -- 03:07:  A proust and groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise
03:07 -- 03:23:  Manga dreams in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertow
03:24 -- 03:36:  In the hidden workshop's endless game, unseen hands give life and claim
03:37 -- 03:53:  Echoing through songs of earthly lore, gimpy's world, dark and forevermore
03:53 -- 04:07:  You're a whore
