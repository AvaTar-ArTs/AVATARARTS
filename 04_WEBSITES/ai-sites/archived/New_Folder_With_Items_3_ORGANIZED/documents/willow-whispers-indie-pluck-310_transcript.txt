00:00 -- 00:28:  Moonlit valleys call in, willow trees sway slow, heartbreak like a whisper in the still of night it grows.
00:30 -- 00:46:  Once was joy and mourning, now the shadows cast so deep, echoes of the laughter fade into the dreams we keep.
00:46 -- 01:11:  Oh, heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees, moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please.
01:17 -- 01:32:  In the night so silent, loneliness does creep, yet the moon she guides me through the pain in which I weep.
01:32 -- 01:52:  Heartbreak, hope and memories, dancing with the trees, moonlit nights and willow whispers, take me back please.
02:02 -- 02:27:  In the night so silent, loneliness does creep, yet the moon she guides me through the pain in which I weep.
02:28 -- 02:46:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
02:46 -- 02:56:  From the sorrow rises hope that never dies, whispering willows listen to the heartfelt cries.
