00:00 -- 00:28:  The candle's low, the shadow's tall Time creeps silent down these walls
00:29 -- 00:42:  Each breath I take, a breath too late Each moment now a hand of fate
00:43 -- 00:55:  No visitors, no priest, no sound Just dreams that haunt this underground
00:56 -- 01:10:  The stars won't come, the sky won't turn Only the weight of what I've earned
01:11 -- 01:24:  The hourglass shatters grain by grain No cry, no plea, no hope remains
01:25 -- 01:33:  This is the reckoning, slow and sure A crown can't buy a soul's cure
01:33 -- 01:43:  I watch the light I held decay And now I wait for break of day
01:44 -- 01:56:  I named myself with fire and fear But now I speak to ghosts, not peers
01:57 -- 02:09:  I called the law, I called it fate But I was running from the weight
02:10 -- 02:17:  If I had time, I'd write them all The names I lost, the ones who fall
02:17 -- 02:27:  But time won't grant me one more line The ink runs dry, this guilt is mine
02:27 -- 02:40:  The hourglass shatters grain by grain No choir sings, no banner's strain
02:40 -- 02:47:  This is the fall I would not see The final gift I gave to me
02:47 -- 03:09:  A kingdom carved in shadow's name Now whispers only what I became
03:18 -- 03:36:  The hourglass shatters in the dark No flame remains, no guiding spark
03:36 -- 03:49:  Just one last breath, one final sting And then the end of the fallen king
04:36 -- 04:49:  And then the end of the fallen king
05:06 -- 05:09:  Thanks for watching!
