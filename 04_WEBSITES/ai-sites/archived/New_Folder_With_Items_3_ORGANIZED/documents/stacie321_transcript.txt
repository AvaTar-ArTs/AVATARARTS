00:00 -- 00:19:  There's a hush where her name won't go Where the wheat bends down like it used to
00:19 -- 00:23:  know And the sun just sinks without a sound
00:23 -- 00:32:  Like it's waiting for her to come around Slifty rooms that held too much
00:32 -- 00:39:  And curtains soft and worn in touch Where love went quiet, slow and small
00:39 -- 00:47:  And left its shoes in the upstairs hall They say she had a voice like spring
00:47 -- 00:54:  But sang in keys that pain would bring And when he drove to the county line
00:54 -- 01:02:  She sold her silence in a tune Stacia, they built you wrong
01:02 -- 01:09:  Taught you hush when you held strong But you learned truth from dust and flame
01:09 -- 01:25:  Now sorrow rises when they say your name
01:25 -- 01:32:  No calendar could mark the shift It wasn't war, it was the drift
01:32 -- 01:40:  Of one who stayed when no one asked And stitched herself into the past
01:40 -- 01:48:  The porch still waits, the paint still peels The wind still talks and spinning wheels
01:48 -- 01:57:  And every mile they let her down Still follows her through empty town
01:57 -- 02:03:  If love was ever meant to last It would've wept when she walked past
02:03 -- 02:12:  But time just watched and let her fall Into the shape the silence told
02:12 -- 02:19:  Stacia, they built you wrong But still you dance when the world moved on
02:19 -- 02:26:  And in the hollows where they sleep Your name is carved so dark
02:26 -- 02:28:  And deep
02:39 -- 02:45:  She doesn't haunt, she doesn't beg She sips her coffee, bends her leg
02:45 -- 02:53:  And every morning breaks the same With nothing left to carry but her name
02:56 -- 03:06:  Stacia
03:06 -- 03:12:  Stacey runs with the stillness now Not gone, just somewhere, time
