00:00 -- 00:17:  Down the roads no map remembers now In fields the silos still allow
00:17 -- 00:27:  She lives between what was and is Where silence names what memory missed
00:27 -- 00:32:  Once upon a time a happy ending Seemed not so far away
00:32 -- 00:36:  Like Belle within those roads three lives she grew
00:36 -- 00:41:  With hands that stitched the sky to blue
00:41 -- 00:49:  Acacia, Dakota, Austin flame The roots that whisper back her name
00:49 -- 00:55:  She walks a house not built with lies But filled with echoes that don't die
00:55 -- 01:03:  As touch was shared not once, not small But faces shaped by a childhood's call
01:03 -- 01:08:  They laughed on beaches far from snow While winter carved the porch below
01:08 -- 01:19:  Vacations bought with stolen breath And family burned in quiet death
01:19 -- 01:25:  The heartland doesn't speak too loud It hurts beneath a silent shroud
01:25 -- 01:37:  But rage runs deep in family lines Like rivers under faultless pines
01:37 -- 01:42:  Her grandkids smile from states away Their photos hung then tucked away
01:42 -- 01:50:  She holds her joy like sacred dust While others drown her in their lust
01:50 -- 01:56:  The shame he doesn't dare confess A boy in grown-up selfishness
01:56 -- 02:06:  The friend who played like time stood still Now buried deep beneath her will
02:06 -- 02:12:  You'd never know the things she's lost Her voice won't name the final cost
02:12 -- 02:23:  But look close in her kitchen light You'll see a crown not made of white
02:23 -- 02:28:  The heartland doesn't scream or cry But it remembers who and why
02:28 -- 02:34:  And when the family turns their heads It's not from her, it's from the dead
02:34 -- 02:40:  Not death of flesh, but death of trust The weight of promises to dust
02:40 -- 02:46:  Still she wakes and still she gives In places most forgot she lives
02:46 -- 02:52:  Her children groan, their stories spun But she's the thread through every one
02:52 -- 02:59:  And even when they drift or roam They're written deep inside her home
03:01 -- 03:07:  The heartland doesn't beg or plead It grows what's planted, pulls no weed
03:07 -- 03:14:  She's not a saint, she's not a ghost But she's the one who hurts the most
03:25 -- 03:31:  A woman wronged, a soil kissed By tears and time and all that's missed
03:31 -- 03:37:  Still standing where the quiet calls With roots that reach through every wall
03:37 -- 03:49:  She never needed them to see The truth was hers and always free
