00:00 -- 00:20:  In the shadows where secrets are laid, a driving rhythm starts to play, gritty strings and
00:20 -- 00:31:  whispered tales, a woodcarver's world where mystery prevails.
00:31 -- 00:41:  Spars and raw in the verses, tight percussion speaks, electric accents dance through the
00:41 -- 00:44:  peaks.
00:44 -- 00:57:  When the chorus hits, it swells and soars, harmonies lift, unleashing the core.
00:57 -- 01:05:  A crusade groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise, manga dreams
01:05 -- 01:10:  in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertow.
01:14 -- 01:29:  Lo-fi layers, grunge beats bold, a hidden world with tales untold, distorted strums
01:29 -- 01:36:  through the dark oak wood, electric whispers where the carver stood.
01:36 -- 01:53:  Western winds and a violin's trace, E minor chords in vast reverb space.
01:54 -- 02:13:  Clean andrejos tremble and hum, echoes of the tools the shadows have worn.
02:13 -- 02:29:  Harmonicas wail in moody tones, while manga effects set the restless bones.
02:29 -- 02:35:  Lousy spirits haunt the nights, a cinematic dance in mysterious lights.
02:35 -- 02:42:  A crusade groove through windy skies, folk rock heart where the secrets rise, manga dreams
02:42 -- 02:47:  in the sonic flow, mystical touches in the undertow.
02:47 -- 02:55:  In the hidden workshops, endless game, unseen hands give life and claim, echoing through
02:56 -- 03:07:  the songs of earthly lore, gimpy's world, dark and forevermore.
03:09 -- 03:11:  Real ride.
