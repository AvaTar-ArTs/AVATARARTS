00:00 -- 00:01:  Oh-oh-oh
00:01 -- 00:06:  Oh-oh-oh
00:06 -- 00:08:  Seating room clouds, puffing on loud
00:08 -- 00:12:  We won't come down for later on
00:12 -- 00:14:  Watching the world spinning around
00:14 -- 00:18:  Bring you closer like ties to the moon
00:19 -- 00:22:  The sun is setting, but we're just beginning
00:22 -- 00:25:  This feeling's spinning, I'm forever winning
00:25 -- 00:27:  With you by my side, I know we'll never hide
00:27 -- 00:32:  From the love that we found under summer sound

00:45 -- 00:51:  We'll be together
00:52 -- 00:58:  Yeah, yeah
00:58 -- 01:01:  Now the leaves are falling and the air is cold
01:01 -- 01:04:  But our love is burning, never growing old
01:04 -- 01:07:  We made a promise under the August moon
01:07 -- 01:10:  That our summer love will never be through
01:10 -- 01:13:  Forever summer, forever you and I
01:13 -- 01:16:  Under the same sky, never saying goodbye
01:16 -- 01:19:  Summer love
01:20 -- 01:21:  Summer love
01:21 -- 01:23:  Take a walk around the beach
01:23 -- 01:25:  Put your feet in the sand
01:25 -- 01:28:  Don't you be scared, no, I'll hold your hand
01:28 -- 01:32:  Nothing can describe the feeling that I feel when I'm with you
01:32 -- 01:34:  Forevermore, I'll never forget you
01:34 -- 01:40:  Baby, you can be my summer love
