00:00 -- 00:23:  In the stillness of her mind A rose blooms, secrets entwined
00:24 -- 00:35:  A tale as old as time unfolds In silent dreams her heart holds
00:39 -- 00:48:  Behind closed eyes she sees the light A spark within, burning bright
00:49 -- 01:00:  Though shadows dance and doubts arise Her soul reflects the starry skies
01:02 -- 01:11:  Beauty lies where none can see Within her heart, wild and free
01:11 -- 01:26:  Through every trial, every scar She shines, her own guiding star
01:41 -- 01:59:  Whispers of a distant song Echoes where she once belonged
02:00 -- 02:11:  Yearning for a world anew A place where dreams might come true
02:12 -- 02:21:  Petals fall yet roots remain Strength arising from the pain
02:22 -- 02:31:  In her silence stories grow Of love, of loss, of letting go
02:32 -- 02:41:  Beauty lies where none can see Within her heart, wild and free
02:42 -- 02:57:  Through every trial, every scar She shines, her own guiding star
02:57 -- 03:10:  A tale as old as time they say Yet in her it's lived each day
03:11 -- 03:23:  No need for crowns or grand displays Her truth illuminates the way
